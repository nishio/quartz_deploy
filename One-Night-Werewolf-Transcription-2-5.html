Tachikawa: I‚Äôll take this place.
Voice: Night has fallen. Fortune tellers wake up and choose someone to divine. 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, close your eyes. Werewolves wake up and look at each other, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, close your eyes. Thieves wake up and steal someone‚Äôs heart. 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0. Close your eyes. Close your eyes. Everyone wake up.</li>
<li>Mr. X‚Äôs unnatural gestures
Nishio: Basically, you shouldn‚Äôt get any information at night so that you don‚Äôt notice anything.
Man X: Oh, excuse me. I‚Äôm sorry.
Tachikawa: If you want, you can shuffle again.
Nishio: Well, let‚Äôs do it.
Tachikawa: (laughs)
NISHIO: It‚Äôs just that there are people who feel something who have sensed it.
Tachikawa: (laughs)
Nishio: Yes.
Tachikawa: Well.
Man X: I‚Äôm a villager with no position, but I just thought there was a thief.
Nishio: I see. From timing. Well, well, well. I thought so too.
Male X: I believe there is a phantom thief, but if there is a phantom thief, I exchanged with the villagers that it would be beneficial to come forward as a phantom thief.
Nishio: merit when exchanged. There is merit in coming forward, but not coming forward means that the thief is a werewolf.
Man X: Ahhh.
Tachikawa: Is there a thief?
Nishio: No. By the way, there is no fortune teller?
Tachikawa: I don‚Äôt know. I was a fortune teller hiding earlier.
Male Y: (laughs)
Tachikawa: It‚Äôs possible that the fortune teller is silent.
Nishio: I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a bad idea (in terms of the rules) to talk on the assumption that there is a thief, but if we are in a situation where there was a thief and he took the werewolf, these two (Nishio and X) are not the thief. I‚Äôm in a situation where I‚Äôm thinking there was a thief, so whichever of the two was the thief means one of them was the werewolf, which means one of them is the werewolf now.
Tachikawa: But I think there was a phantom thief too.
Man X: Oh, so you‚Äôre declaring that you‚Äôre not a thief?
Male Y: (laughs) That question is interesting.
Male X: Can I interpret that to mean that you think there was a phantom thief, and that the person called ‚Äúphantom thief‚Äù was someone other than yourself? Male X: I‚Äôm just confirming that I think there was a thief.
Tachikawa: Feel free to interpret.
Man X: Eh. It‚Äôs a weird feeling. Why do you have to feel uncomfortable?
Tachikawa: (laughs)
Nishio: To be frank, Mr. Tachikawa, are you trying to say that you were a villager?
Tachikawa: I am a villager.
Man X: Oh, good then.
Nishio: So, by process of elimination, Mr. Y is a werewolf.
Man Y: I‚Äôm a werewolf? What? But why are you a villager? I‚Äôm not sure.
Tachikawa: What I don‚Äôt understand, and Y-san doesn‚Äôt understand either, is why Nishio-san is so natural about his being a village.
Male X: Yes, yes, yes. I don‚Äôt understand that part either.
Nishio: Because you are a villager. I made the assumption that I was a villager because my card was a villager.
Tachikawa: Then why, despite the presence of the thief
Man X: Oh, yeah. Possibility of replacing the thief with a thief and becoming a thief.
Nishio: No, that‚Äôs why the thief is coming out, if that was the case. That‚Äôs why I traded the thief for the werewolf.</li>
<li>If the thief is exchanging with Nishio, a villager, then the thief must be coming out, and since he is not, the thief is saying that he is not exchanging with the werewolf, and therefore Nishio‚Äôs card, a villager, remains a villager.
Tachikawa: I‚Äôm trading with a werewolf there‚Ä¶
Nishio: Yes.
Tachikawa: Maybe. And the fortune teller does not appear. Up to this point. What I don‚Äôt understand is that my common sense doesn‚Äôt apply. That‚Äôs it.
Male Y: (laughs)
Nishio: It‚Äôs not common sense, just a bunch of bias.</li>
<li>ref.  <a href="./Common-sense-is-full-of-bias." class="internal alias" data-slug="Common-sense-is-full-of-bias.">Common sense is full of bias.</a>
Male Y: Because I think the fact that there is a thief is probably a story that all of these people recognize.
Tachikawa: Fortune-telling at the same time. This is true.
Nishio: Really?
All: (laughs)
Tachikawa: According to my perception, the fortune teller should not be here. I don‚Äôt know anymore because of the example I just gave you. I can‚Äôt make up my mind. Basically, I want the village to win.
Male Y: May the village win.
Nishio: Mr. Y, you say something that sounds werewolf-like based on Mr. Tachikawa‚Äôs argument, do you have any rebuttal? I have to make some kind of counterargument. I have to get rid of my suspicions.
Man Y: Oh, so that‚Äôs what you mean. I can‚Äôt get rid of my doubts. All I can say is that I am not a werewolf.
Man X: What was his occupation, he was a villager.
Male Y: Yes, yes. Only villagers, oh, I don‚Äôt know if I should say villagers. That‚Äôs all I can say, sorry. I don‚Äôt have any logic or anything.
Nishio: No information observed.
Male Y: That‚Äôs what I mean.
Nishio: Logic cannot explain that part.
Male Y: I can‚Äôt.
Nishio: How much more credit do we need?
Male Y: Yes, yes.
Nishio: I found it interesting that Mr. Tachikawa is not trusted.
Tachikawa: When I work with these members, I always catch something every time. We get caught every time. Whether it is a villager, a fortune teller, or a werewolf, we get caught every time.
Nishio: I think you only remember the part where you were caught.
Tachikawa: I‚Äôve only been caught this time.
Nishio: Yes. This time. For sure.
Man X: Like that.
Nishio: I‚Äôm the director of a marriage agency and they don‚Äôt trust me.
Man X: That‚Äôs right (laughs).
All: (laughs)
Tachikawa: No, you are easily caught, aren‚Äôt you? Everyone is talking about me except for me.
Man X: Why are you doing it? You are the one doing it, aren‚Äôt you?
Nishio: There is a sense of invitation, isn‚Äôt there? In a sense, there is a sense of ‚ÄúI feel sorry for myself for being beaten up.
Man X: Yes, yes.
Nishio: If it‚Äôs different, then it‚Äôs different, but you have to argue a little more like this.
Tachikawa: No, it‚Äôs not that. I think there was a thief. The thief seems to have drawn a werewolf.
Male X: Ten more seconds.
Tachikawa: So I‚Äôm thinking that one of these two is not a werewolf.
Nishio: Unfortunately, time out.
Tachikawa: Yes, se-no!
Nishio: „Äì00:53:57„Äì?
Tachikawa: We have not gathered.
Nishio: Tachikawa-san caught one. What, but moreover, the fact that he is a thief now means that he was a villager himself? What was it?
Tachikawa: I was a villager.
Nishio: He was a villager.
Man X: Who is the werewolf?
Nishio: Werewolves.
Male Y: (laughs)
Tachikawa: Eh, wait a minute, this needs explanation.
Male Y: I don‚Äôt understand this.
Male X: I got it. Yay.
Nishio: It was a different direction than I expected.
Man X: I thought maybe one of us would die.
Tachikawa: What was it, Mr. Y?
Man Y: I‚Äôm a thief. Phantom thief.
Nishio: exchanged with villagers but did not come out.
Man X: What? Why?
Tachikawa: Why didn‚Äôt you tell me?
Man Y: Oh, this is my mistake. I didn‚Äôt see this card. I was wondering what to say because I didn‚Äôt see my card. I thought it would be okay if I just said I was a villager.
Tachikawa: Oh my God.
Male Y: Mr. Tachikawa told me that, so I thought that Mr. Tachikawa was a villager, or perhaps it was all right.
Tachikawa: Oh, so one of them was a werewolf. I don‚Äôt know about that.
Man X: But if the level of conviction is low, the power of persuasion is weak.
Nishio: By not mentioning the fact that he was a thief but failed to see it, he is telling some kind of lie.
Man X: Yes.
Nishio: Taking into account that this was the first time, it is possible that saying something like, ‚ÄúI made a mistake,‚Äù would have worked.
Male Y: Oh, that‚Äôs what I mean. I see. You can talk about that too. Oh, I see.
Nishio: In any case, I confide everything sincerely.
Male Y: Oh, I see.
Tachikawa: ‚ÄúUm - I didn‚Äôt see what it was. But I am a former thief and I exchanged with Mr. Tachikawa.
Male Y: Oh, I see.
Nishio: In that case, I would assume that Tachikawa-san was a werewolf and hang Y-san.</li>
<li>If the story is ‚ÄúMr. Tachikawa was a werewolf, and Mr. Y took it, and Mr. Y is a werewolf,‚Äù Mr. Y cannot refute the story, so the story is ‚ÄúMr. Y is a werewolf.
Male Y: (laughs)
Tachikawa: That‚Äôs where our eyes met completely.
Male Y: Yes, that‚Äôs right. That‚Äôs what I mean. Roger. Roger.
Tachikawa: Let‚Äôs do this one more time. Let‚Äôs do it one more time.
Male Y: Okay. So we can look at the thief after we change it. Roger. Roger.
Tachikawa: Yes, yes. You can look at the thief.
Nishio: I shouldn‚Äôt replace it after looking at it beforehand, but I‚Äôll take a shoo and look at it afterwards.
Man Y: So it‚Äôs OK to say. The fortune teller can look at any one of them.
Tachikawa: Either one person other than yourself or two pieces in the middle.
Male Y: I see. You can look at the two in the middle.
Tachikawa: You can also look at the two pictures in the middle together.
Man X: Oh, what about the fortune teller?
Tachikawa: The fortune teller is.
Male Y: Oh, that‚Äôs one of them. I understand.
Nishio: Like, look at the two in the middle and they were both werewolves.
Nishio: I‚Äôve been a werewolf three times in a row, and it‚Äôs time for a change.
Man X: Four times is bad.
Tachikawa: The cards are surprisingly, if you don‚Äôt use them carefully, they will peel off rapidly, so please be careful.</li>
