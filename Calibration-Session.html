<ul>
<li><a href="./Tomoya-Tachikawa" class="internal alias" data-slug="Tomoya-Tachikawa">Tomoya Tachikawa</a> and Nishio spontaneously started in late 2018, has continued for three years, and both parties have found it a very beneficial association.</li>
<li>see  <a href="./Calibration-meeting-generation-process" class="internal alias" data-slug="Calibration-meeting-generation-process">Calibration meeting generation process</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It is hard to imagine that this beneficial system would only work for the Tachikawa-Nishio pair.
Therefore, the purpose of this page is to pick up “elements necessary for the system to function” from “(Tachikawa and Nishio’s) calibration meeting” as a proper noun, and to create the concept of “calibration meeting” as a general noun that other pairs can try.</p>
<p>elements</p>
<ul>
<li>1on1</li>
<li>(Internet) chat</li>
<li>Scrapbox</li>
<li>Two people.</li>
</ul>
<p>1on1</p>
<ul>
<li>Must be 2 people, no more than 3 will be accepted.
<ul>
<li>I’ve tried many times, thinking things like, “It would be a shame to keep this meeting to just the two of us,” but I’ve failed at all of them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Highly flexible in format
<ul>
<li>Face-to-face oral conversation, conference room with whiteboard, walk in the park, video conferencing, walk on one side with only audio connected</li>
<li>Can’t chat be substituted?
<ul>
<li>Maybe you can do it if you try?
<ul>
<li><a href="./Is-it-important-to-share-the-thought-process" class="internal alias" data-slug="Is-it-important-to-share-the-thought-process">Is it important to share the thought process?</a></li>
<li>But that’s only if we can decide, “Let’s focus on chatting for two hours from now.
<ul>
<li>…I’d have a conversation with you if that was a possible situation.</li>
<li>So you’re saying you value it more than chatting.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>PS: I don’t think <a href="./symbolic-modeling" class="internal alias" data-slug="symbolic-modeling">symbolic modeling</a> can tolerate chat lag.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(Internet) chat</p>
<ul>
<li>Written means of communication</li>
<li>No need for complex functions.
<ul>
<li>I use Facebook Messenger for historical reasons.</li>
<li>I didn’t even think a search was necessary until I decided to check the process of occurrence this time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Typical use case: the night of a 1-on-1, or the next day, or a few days later, “Isn’t XX YY? or “I thought we talked about ZZ, but I think it’s not…” or “I thought we talked about ZZ, but I think it’s different.</li>
</ul>
<p>Scrapbox</p>
<ul>
<li>A long-term repository of discussion summaries</li>
<li>Probably plays a very important role.
<ul>
<li>But, even in the current situation, it is probably not the optimal way to do things, so future improvements are needed.</li>
<li>Other means tried
<ul>
<li>Write on a whiteboard, discuss, take pictures and share.
<ul>
<li>When you write on a whiteboard and discuss it, of course you say, “Let’s take a picture before we erase it.</li>
<li>But this is a lack of functionality, it doesn’t read back.</li>
<li>Another drawback is that it’s an image, so it’s not searchable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Record and transcribe all conversations.
<ul>
<li>Nishio said, “It would be a shame to lose the conversation, so let’s make it searchable,” and we outsourced the human transcription for a while.</li>
<li>I don’t read it back because it’s too much.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Handwritten notes on iPad</li>
<li>While I was doing these things, Nishio was working in parallel to put them together in this Scrapbox.
<ul>
<li>Interesting notes based on 1-on-1 discussions</li>
<li>It wasn’t even intended to be a “record of the meeting.”
<ul>
<li>So it is often <a href="./Nodes-of-Thought" class="internal alias" data-slug="Nodes-of-Thought">Nodes of Thought</a>.
<ul>
<li>Case: <a href="./Nodal-Point-of-Thought2021-08-06" class="internal alias" data-slug="Nodal-Point-of-Thought2021-08-06">Nodal Point of Thought2021-08-06</a> <a href="./Nodal-Point-of-Thought-20200825" class="internal alias" data-slug="Nodal-Point-of-Thought-20200825">Nodal Point of Thought 20200825</a></li>
<li>There is no appropriate title for the whole, because it is written on a single page with seemingly unrelated topics that are difficult to disentangle because they lead to common keywords with the previous topic, or because there may be a connection that you have not yet noticed because the story has turned out that way, although you have not found a particular connection. So it’s “Nodal Point of Thought”.
<ul>
<li>In hindsight, “Calibration Meeting 2021-08-06” would have been fine.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some “stand-alone pages” may be cut out after the fact
<ul>
<li>Example <a href="./Nodal-point-of-trial2019-12-05" class="internal alias" data-slug="Nodal-point-of-trial2019-12-05">Nodal point of trial2019-12-05</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It’s being done on a public project.
<ul>
<li>1on1 is basically done with the assumption that it will not be open to the public.
<ul>
<li>So, if you want to publish it, you need to get permission.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>That was tedious, so it occurred in the form of “my thoughts generated by the conversation” on the page.
<ul>
<li>So the purpose is not to “record the conversation”, but rather not to write down what Mr. Tachikawa’s side said.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There are good and bad points to this.
<ul>
<li>Good point, it will be a dense mass of information reconstructed by your subjectivity.
<ul>
<li>Filtered by subjectivity, low-density conversations are discarded.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bad point, there is probably information that is useful but discarded because of the public assumption.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Should we do this in a private group?
<ul>
<li>In fact, there is a proper private group.
<ul>
<li>I’m putting up transcripts and whiteboard photos.
<ul>
<li><a href="./Warehouse-of-dead-texts" class="internal alias" data-slug="Warehouse-of-dead-texts">Warehouse of dead texts</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I once did a “Let’s do it while co-editing a private group page.”
<ul>
<li>I just looked back and realized the level of</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Keywords created during the conversation become links on Scrapbox.
<ul>
<li>Example
- <a href="./human-bug" class="internal alias" data-slug="human-bug">human bug</a>
- <a href="./Properly-subjective" class="internal alias" data-slug="Properly-subjective">Properly subjective</a>
- <a href="./People-have-individual-differences." class="internal alias" data-slug="People-have-individual-differences.">People have individual differences.</a></li>
<li>This causes [passage of time
<ul>
<li><a href="./Parable-of-the-Ropes" class="internal alias" data-slug="Parable-of-the-Ropes">Parable of the Ropes</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>By using keywords repeatedly over time in monthly 1-on-1s, useful keywords will branch out and grow.</li>
<li>If we had used a non-Scrapbox tool (e.g. Google Docs), I don’t think this effect would have been possible.
<ul>
<li>Read-backs are triggered by connecting links.
<ul>
<li>I just now read <a href="./passage-of-time" class="internal alias" data-slug="passage-of-time">passage of time</a> and found the key words <a href="./Social-Triggers" class="internal alias" data-slug="Social-Triggers">Social Triggers</a>.</li>
<li>1-on-1s and chats are <a href="./Highly-Concentrated-Social-Trigger-Sources" class="internal alias" data-slug="Highly-Concentrated-Social-Trigger-Sources">Highly Concentrated Social Trigger Sources</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Two people.</p>
<ul>
<li>What conditions are required of the two people who are the components?
<ul>
<li>I think there’s a strong constraint, because two random people would definitely not work first.</li>
<li>On the other hand, I don’t think it’s limited to the Tachikawa-Nishio pair.</li>
<li>They both find this meeting interesting.
<ul>
<li>So it’s been repeated.</li>
<li>Intellectual production occurred after it was repeated, and you wouldn’t have expected it from the start.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why do you two find this meeting interesting?
<ul>
<li>The core value of a calibration meeting in my subjective view is not the production or discovery of knowledge The core value of a calibration meeting in my subjective view is not the production or discovery of knowledge
<ul>
<li>Tachikawa-san is the one who pulls the trigger of the meeting and provides the topic in the first place.
<ul>
<li>I don’t have much desire for voice conversation, so I don’t say, “I want to talk!” I don’t want to talk.</li>
<li>I send it to chat when it comes to mind.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the early days, I used it as a laboratory for <a href="./symbolic-modeling" class="internal alias" data-slug="symbolic-modeling">symbolic modeling</a>.
<ul>
<li>I thought it would be interesting to draw out the mental model in Mr. Tachikawa and verbalize it.</li>
<li>He is a science major, has a similar thought pattern to me, and yet he is the director of a dating service, a path I would never have chosen in my life, and he must have had experiences that I have not had, so it is beneficial to draw information from him.</li>
<li>I still often observe that Tachikawa-san often brings a list of “things he wants to talk about,” and I often ask, “What is it?” Why? I think I’m more likely to say something like, “That’s not what I want to talk about.” I think I tend to say something like that more often than not.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As we were doing that, with the help of Scrapbox, a common language began to emerge between the two of us.
<ul>
<li>There is only one person in the world with whom you can have a high-density conversation using this common language.</li>
<li>This makes the 1-on-1 and subsequent chats a driving force that makes the branches of thought powerfully overgrown.
<ul>
<li>[I used to be someone who thought it was “interesting.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tachikawa’s Point of View
<ul>
<li>
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/立川 智也/icon" alt="立川 智也.icon" height="19.5"/>
  - Originally, I was in the habit of arguing with my father until about high school.
  - The term &quot;calibration meeting&quot; was an afterthought, and this was a &quot;lifestyle&quot; in the first place.
  - I find it interesting to hear about &quot;what he/she has been through.&quot;
      - My father's sources of information became less interesting as they became mainly television and other sources of information.
      - <img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Mr. Tachikawa finds it interesting that &quot;it varies from person to person,&quot; and I wonder if experience is part of that.
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>The interesting thing that Tachikawa finds in the conversations he regularly has with others is whether they are the same or different, and if so, how are they different?</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/立川 智也/icon" alt="立川 智也.icon" height="19.5"/>When I talk to everyone except Mr. Nishio, I “expect to be cheered up by them”. I do not expect to be cheered up by Mr. Nishio.</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Is being “energized” by “someone you meet expecting to be energized” done by hearing about “an experience that person has had?”</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/立川 智也/icon" alt="立川 智也.icon" height="19.5"/>Yes</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>As a thought experiment, what do you think if I don’t talk about my experiences at all, but only ask questions that encourage structuring thoughts like I am doing now?</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/立川 智也/icon" alt="立川 智也.icon" height="19.5"/>I think you’ll find it interesting.</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>(In other words, I wanted to do symbolic modeling, and Mr. Tachikawa found it interesting to do symbolic modeling.)</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Read “The Nishio Perspective.”</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/立川 智也/icon" alt="立川 智也.icon" height="19.5"/>The core value of a calibration session, in my subjective view, is not the production or discovery of knowledge, but the process of getting to know each other and the trial-and-error process of how to have a good time together.
<ul>
<li>It’s interesting that there is intellectual excitement or new discoveries, but those are also in the big picture of “play”!</li>
<li>Calibration meetings feel like a “lifestyle”.</li>
<li>Playing is a way of life.”</li>
<li>I think “playing” includes “communicating with others” completely.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Why did you still try to have another meeting after the BMOT monthly event experiment was over?</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/立川 智也/icon" alt="立川 智也.icon" height="19.5"/>Because it’s fun. It’s a good deal to do something fun that might lead to some kind of event planning or job! I might have thought like that. It’s a hazy memory because so much time has passed.</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>I see.
