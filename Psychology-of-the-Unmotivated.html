<p>This book is not a commentary on the causes of human despair, apathy, and oopsiness. It is a book about how people with a tendency toward apathy can get out of it and live well. I am among those who have a tendency to become apathetic.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>This book explains the causes of human apathy and other factors, quoting from <a href="./Seligman's" class="internal alias" data-slug="Seligman's">Seligman’s</a> paper. It doesn’t clearly describe Seligman’s original experiment.</p>
<ul>
<li>(Well, I guess they decided that if the setting of the experiment or something comes out of nowhere at the beginning of the reading, the general reader will put the book back on the shelf.)</li>
<li>If you want to know more, look up “<a href="./learned-helplessness" class="internal alias" data-slug="learned-helplessness">learned helplessness</a>”.</li>
<li>Roughly speaking, “a creature that has experienced pain from which it cannot escape will not run away from pain from which it can escape.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>I thought it was dangerous that a person who is really tired of his/her mind might read this book and think, “Oh, that’s why I’m so bad, I’m so useless, I’m so tainted by helplessness, I can’t motivate myself forever, I’m sorry for living” because the original experiment is an experiment. I can’t motivate myself for the rest of my life. I’m sorry I’m alive. The important thing is to be aware that both dogs and humans have a tendency to fall into such a trap, and when you feel unmotivated, look at yourself objectively and say, “Oh, now I am stuck in a feeling of helplessness,” relax your shoulders and try again, thinking, “It may not work, but it might work. You did it! I’m glad I did it! When you succeed, you praise yourself, saying, “I did it!</p>

<p>People who judge themselves tend to judge others as well. There are people who make themselves conform to such assumptions: “You’re happy,” “You’re kind,” “You’re not having a hard time. Some people are troubled because they cannot say, “I am not like that. Their goal in life is to meet the expectations of others. Those who do not feel annoyed by having their ideal image imposed on them are those who have low self-esteem.</p>

<p>[According to <a href="./Karen-Hornai" class="internal alias" data-slug="Karen-Hornai">Karen Hornai</a> <a href="./there-are-three-types-of-anxiety-coping" class="internal alias" data-slug="there-are-three-types-of-anxiety-coping">there are three types of anxiety coping</a>. One of them is pandering. It is the self-annihilation type. This type of coping results in a person becoming hopelessness. A person who panders can only pander. They cannot be aggressive. They cannot withdraw.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are those who hurry not because they have a reason to hurry, but because they are driven by anxiety and fear, consumed by daily life. There are those who do nothing but are exhausted. Not knowing what they are rushing toward is not what they are rushing toward. They are just trying to escape from the status quo.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>People’s dissatisfaction is proportional to their degree of passivity. When we do various projects, participants are usually highly dissatisfied in order of passivity.</p>

<li>There is.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Students exposed to inescapable noise vs. no noise vs. inescapable noise, hopelessness also delays the resolution of non-hateful tasks. An inescapable aversive experience makes the student less active even in non aversive daily tasks.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>This is frightening. For example, when there are people in the home who do nasty things that are impossible to escape, it’s easy to assume that even if you’re studying in school, you’re not good enough if you fail a little bit. I guess helplessness is a disease that can eat away at your whole life.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Giving up reinforces a sense of helplessness.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The more people who don’t act, the more they like to speculate and argue. They argue to a surprising degree. <a href="./They-guess-at-what-the-other-person-is-trying-to-do." class="internal alias" data-slug="They-guess-at-what-the-other-person-is-trying-to-do.">They guess at what the other person is trying to do.</a> Because they only guess without taking confirmatory action, they speculate to such an extent that they start thinking behind the scenes. They complicate simple things by guessing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Unlike rats, if humans remain frustrated, the misfortune of others who seem to be living a joyful life becomes their joy in life. Envy others, and it becomes your pleasure to make others unhappy.</p>

<ul>
<li>There are some. For example, there are many on 2chan.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>When you find yourself frustrated, don’t forget to make an effort to break free. Don’t assume that you can’t change. Sometimes you can try and you can’t, but sometimes you can.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>They say they are dissatisfied with the teachers, dissatisfied with the school. When asked what they are dissatisfied with, they cannot answer. People who express such dissatisfaction do not take any action to solve the problem.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>So the dissatisfaction remains ambiguous and continues unresolved for a long time.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The dog, hit by an inescapable electric shock, gets off the competition immediately.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Build your own foundation. It is to stop ignoring or overworking one’s body. You can’t run fast, about where you are afraid. Accept it. Starting from “this is how it should be” is stressful. You think that when you achieve the “should,” you will be liberated. But that “should” is an unrealistic standard.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Even if you think you have set a realistic standard, once you reach that point, you see further and think, “I should be able to do that too. There will never come a time when you feel you have achieved it.</li>
</ul>

<p>We are struggling with something much closer to home, but we avoid facing it <a href="./discussing-the-state-under-heaven" class="internal alias" data-slug="discussing-the-state-under-heaven">discussing the state under heaven</a>. That’s why we can never overcome our sense of hopelessness. It is hard to love one’s neighbor, but it is easy to love mankind. I despair of mankind” is a reflection of “I am disappointed in me.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You demand high standards from others because you repress disappointment in yourself. You’re trying to resolve your own emotional conflicts by finding what you’ve repressed in others and blaming them for it.</p>
