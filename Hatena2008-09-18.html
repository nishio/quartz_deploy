*1221708888* How to improve the accuracy of Hatena surveys
I am truly sorry to anyone who was offended by this entry or the survey. I have written an explanation and apology in the following entry.
http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nishiohirokazu/20080922/1222094878

-----

Sequel to this: http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nishiohirokazu/20080917/1221667941
Synopsis: I asked at the mid-progress open house whether Python or Haskell was harder, and the result was impossible, like a close call. I wonder if there are a lot of people who chose at random. In the question that was closed to the public, the result was Python > Scheme > Haskell in order of suitability for beginners, but Coq got more votes than Haskell, which is an impossible result. I wonder if there are many people who voted for Coq at the top of the list for the time being.

This time method: The first question will be a 12-choice question that requires a certain level of knowledge to answer. Only the results of those who answered the first question correctly will be looked at, since a cross tabulation can be done.

http://q.hatena.ne.jp/1221708568

-----

...At this point there are 19 answers and 0 correct answers.... Even if it says not to answer if you don't know the answer, they seem to be ignoring it. Do you want so many points? I'm going to say something like &quot;I'm in despair,&quot; in the style of Mr. Zetsubou-sensei! I despair at the low ethical standards of Hatena! I despair at Hatena's low sense of ethics!

-----

It would be nice to have a feature that says, &quot;We will refuse to respond to people who gave certain answers in the survey in the future.&quot;

-----

Ended.
Am I right in understanding that the conclusion that &quot;19 out of 20 survey respondents are 'noise sources who respond appropriately to surveys they are not asked to answer'&quot; was revealed after all? Oh dear.

Is Q1 really that hard? I thought it was supposed to be an easy question.

*1221750501*Outputs prime numbers less than the specified number (but not characters 0-9)
The topic was discussed in 86 chat, so I tried to implement it on the train on the way home @ 23:01.

or rather (say)
>|python|
>>> len(())
0
>>> len(&quot; &quot;)
1
||&lt;
You can make numbers with this.

>|python|
>>> primes = []
>>> for i in range(len(&quot;  &quot;), input()):
...     for p in primes:
...             if i % p == len(()): break
...     else:
...             primes.append(i)
... 
100
>>> primes
[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97]
||&lt;

Boring. Coding standing up is tiring. 23:06.

I sat down. 23:09.

-----

23:34. Waiting for the departure of the Eastern Isesaki Line.

>|python|
import re
N = input(&quot;IN>>&quot;)
lines = []
while N:
    lines = [[]]+[[x]for x in lines]
    N -= True

def mul(xs, n, result=&quot;&quot;):
    if xs:
        return mul(xs.pop()[:], n, result + n)
    return result

def to_num(xs, result=False):
    if xs:
        return to_num(xs.pop()[:], result + True)
    return result


lines.pop(False)
lines.pop(False)
primes = []
for i in lines:
    for p in primes:
        if re.match(&quot;(%s)+$&quot;%mul(p[:], &quot;..&quot;), str(i[:].pop())): break
    else:
        primes.append(i)

print [to_num(p[:]) for p in primes]
||&lt;
I got rid of len for now. It would be more difficult to see if I squashed some functions with readable names or something, but I won't do it.

Boring. Are there not more issues that make my blood boil?

-----

That said, other topics that came up in the 86 chat were &quot;gradual decrease in the number of characters that can be used, like Yūyū Hakusho&quot; and &quot;golf with the small number of character types used&quot;.

-----

23:50. 35 different characters. I found this game not very interesting. Unlike golf, it's not a localized &quot;change this to this and you'll shrink&quot; kind of thing, so it's hard to know what to replace with which.
>|python|
import re
m = input()
o = []
while m:
    o = [[]]+[[x]for x in o]
    m -= not(())

def po(xs, n, r=&quot;&quot;):
    if xs:
        return po(xs.pop()[:], n, r + n)
    return r

def op(pp, r=not([()])):
    if pp:
        return op(pp.pop()[:], r + (not(())))
    return r


o.pop(not([()]))
o.pop(not([()]))
pp = []
for i in o:
    for p in pp:
        if re.match(&quot;(%s)+$&quot;%po(p[:], &quot;..&quot;), str(i[:].pop())): break
    else:
        pp=pp+[i]

print [op(p[:]) for p in pp]
||&lt;

*1221763717*[Mid-term] Flying Diary
I will write the rules later. The PDF will be available after Saturday's presentation. The most recent version is a 3-player game using playing cards, with the median value being the winner. I wrote 133 lines of code in Python to play alone and committed it to CodeRepos.

First, 17 cards are dealt.

****BEGIN GAME
**BEGIN ROUND 0
YOUR HAND:
C01, C02, H02, D02, H04, S04, D05, H06, D06, C09, H09, D11, H12, D12, C13, D13, S13
CHOOSE ONE>>> 
||&lt;
I think there are a lot of 13s and 12s. So, if you look at 4 cards in a row and the numbers don't change by 3, it means that they are concentrated there.

That said, I don't yet understand how to do this, so I'll take it as it comes. For now, I'm going to try to get out around H12.

>||
CHOOSE ONE>>> H12 
PLAY:
H12, S02, C06
MEDIAN: C06 Player 2
SCORES OF ROUND:
0, 0, 6
||&lt;

By the way, I am player 0. 3 players are playing at the same time, so it doesn't matter at all what number I am. Let's play another 12.

>||
CHOOSE ONE>>> D12 
PLAY:
D12, D08, S08
MEDIAN: S08 Player 2
SCORES OF ROUND:
0, 0, 14
||&lt;

Oops. This is bad. If I win the next turn, only I will advance my score. (I haven't explained the rules of the game or the objective of the game, so you may not understand, but I will write an explanation soon.)
S13 is the strongest and C01 is the weakest, so you can play either of those cards and not get the next turn, but, well, it's still early in the game, so save those trump cards. Let's play a small card so that even if we get a score, it won't be too big.

>||
CHOOSE ONE>>> D02
PLAY:
D02, C11, C08
MEDIAN: C08 Player 2
SCORES OF ROUND:
0, 0, 22

**END ROUND 0
MEDIAN OF ROUND SCORES: 0
Player 0 got 0 points
Player 1 got 0 points
SCORES OF GAME:
0, 0, 0
||&lt;

In the end, Player2 took the last turn as well, so 0 points is the median. All players were side by side with 0 points.

Turn 2. Now what to do?
>||
**BEGIN ROUND 1
YOUR HAND:
C01, C02, H02, H04, S04, D05, H06, D06, C09, H09, D11, C13, D13, S13
||&lt;
I still wonder if it's C13 or something.

>||
CHOOSE ONE>>> C13
PLAY:
C13, D10, S07
MEDIAN: D10 Player 1
SCORES OF ROUND:
0, 10, 0
||&lt;

Ten is in? Hmmm. Let's say I roll an 11 next, and if it goes in. If Player2 wins the last turn, I can rest assured that I won't get a round unless I play 12 or more, but if Player1 wins, I'll easily get 11 points for myself, which will be sad. Should I play a small card here?

>||
CHOOSE ONE>>> H02
PLAY:
H02, S09, S01
MEDIAN: H02 Player 0
SCORES OF ROUND:
2, 10, 0
||&lt;

Two went in for me. Well, I guess 9 then. If I win, Player1 will be pushed 10 points, and if Player2 wins, it will probably be bigger than 2.

>||
CHOOSE ONE>>> C09
PLAY:
C09, C12, H10
MEDIAN: H10 Player 2
SCORES OF ROUND:
2, 10, 10

**END ROUND 1
MEDIAN OF ROUND SCORES: 10
Player 1 got 10 points
Player 2 got 10 points
SCORES OF GAME:
0, 10, 10
||&lt;

Player2 had 10 points, so the median was 10, and I was the only one who was 10 points behind. This was not good. With three rounds to go, I would have to let one of the players win to make room for the other player, and then I would have to step in between them to win the game.

With two trump cards that can surely lose the turn, I'm in a situation where I can't go without scoring. Ororo...let's cut S13.

>||
**BEGIN ROUND 2
YOUR HAND:
C01, C02, H04, S04, D05, H06, D06, H09, D11, D13, S13
CHOOSE ONE>>> S13 
PLAY:
S13, C10, H11
MEDIAN: H11 Player 2
SCORES OF ROUND:
0, 0, 11
||&lt;

Mm. Next time, I'll try 11. If I get it right, I can both push Player2 and get myself in between. But wait, it's only turn 2, so even if I get 11, 0, 11 on the next turn, if Player2 gets it on the next turn, will I be the only one to pass by with 11 points? Hmmm. Nope, but it's not that big a deal; play 11.

>||
CHOOSE ONE>>> D11
PLAY:
D11, H13, H03
MEDIAN: D11 Player 0
SCORES OF ROUND:
11, 0, 11
||&lt;

Right on target. Now I just hope Player2 doesn't win. Oh, it's not good for me to win. Let's see. Well, let's play another card that doesn't win.

>||
YOUR HAND:
C01, C02, H04, S04, D05, H06, D06, H09, D13

**END ROUND 2
MEDIAN OF ROUND SCORES: 11
Player 0 got 11 points
Player 2 got 11 points
SCORES OF GAME:
11, 10, 21
||&lt;

Oops, I'm totally on target. Now, if I hold the median position for two more rounds, I can win, but, well, the danger is the case of Player1 overtaking me. Not even if I score 10 points myself, but that's still far away. Let's play the smaller card for now.

I thought...
>||
**BEGIN ROUND 3
YOUR HAND:
C02, H04, S04, D05, H06, D06, H09, D13
||&lt;
I got carried away and used too many good cards, so the remaining cards are stuck in the middle. Well, I guess it is a good idea to play the middle and win all three times and not let anyone else score.

>||
CHOOSE ONE>>> H06 
PLAY:

SCORES OF ROUND:
6, 0, 0

YOUR HAND:
C02, H04, S04, D05, D06, H09, D13
||&lt;

On second thought, I guess that was risky, I hope I get all three, but considering that even if I get out the middle one, which is the easiest to win a turn, I have a 1/2 chance of winning, and with two left, I have a 3/4 chance of winning one of them, except for me. Ah. What should I do? But there's nothing I can do, right? I've spent too many cards willingly in the early game, so there are no moves left to play in the endgame. The only thing to do here is to keep throwing strikes in the middle of the field, believing in 1/4.

||&lt;

If Player1 had won with 7 on the second turn, I could have played C02 or something to reduce the chance of him being in the middle, since he was not in the middle with 6, 7, 0.

It had to be done. It's the last round. I have to score at least 6 points to win. Current cards in hand:

Ummm, 4 went in for me, but even if 5 did in the next turn, it would be meaningless because I am not the median. Or rather, my chance to win was gone when Player2 won with 4 in the previous turn. In order for me to win, I had to take two turns and then someone had to score 9 or something on the rest. Mwah. And since I had 4 and 4, even if Nikkoku Player1 played a strange card next, the situation would still be the same. Was it a mistake to play 4 this turn? Even if Player1 wins by a large number and overtakes Player2, Player2 still wins, but I don't win. Ah.

&lt;body>But when I cross tabulate the results, it seems to be filtered pretty well. &lt;br>The machine language, Nadeshiko, BrainF*ck, etc. are properly set to 0. &lt;br>The population is 6, which is a bit of a gastritis&lt;/body>.

&lt;body>I didn't understand Q1 because I've never touched Scheme.

&lt;body>Well, that's a terrible result. Nishio-san B. &lt;BR>&lt;BR>I don't think machine language is such a bad option. &lt;BR>&lt;BR>If you are going to teach including computer architecture, you need to know how CPUs work, and it is surprisingly easy to understand because you can understand programs as the movement of things without abstract concepts. &lt;BR>&lt;BR>But well, I would still teach in Python. &lt;/body>&lt;br>&lt;br

&lt;BODY>I don't think that machine language, Nadeshiko, or Brainf*ck are &quot;0 and natural&quot;. The advantage of teaching machine language is as Dubhead explained, and the advantage of Brainf*ck is that the architecture is the machine language of simple machines. The point is that there is little to remember and it is easy to view it as a logic puzzle. The merit of Nadeshiko is that the path to the experience of automating a tedious task with programming is short and it is easy to be motivated to &quot;read and understand&quot;. &lt;/body>

&lt;body>I agree with tokoroten. &lt;BR>From someone who has never used a functional language,&lt;BR>there is no way to teach Scheme or Haskell, which are only used by language geeks, to first-year undergraduates, and filtering with them is nonsense. &lt;br>or so I think. &lt;BR>&lt;BR>By the way, the second sentence of the question is weird Japanese, how should I catch it? &lt;/body>

&lt;body>Well, I'm going to be a little harsh on tgbt because he's a friend of mine,&lt;br>but aside from using or teaching Haskell or Scheme as a main language,&lt;br>what Q1 doesn't understand is that he knows almost nothing about Scheme or languages called functional types. &lt;br>&lt;br>What Q1 doesn't understand is that he knows almost nothing about the language called Scheme or functional types. &lt;br>I don't think such a person would know the difference between Haskell and Scheme,&lt;br>and I don't think they could answer the question &quot;which one is better for teaching&quot; without discrimination. &lt;BR>They would rule out some options simply because they have no experience with them. &lt;br>Since that's the kind of respondent you are, I don't see why you should be filtered out. &lt;/body>

&lt;body>I was disappointed that too many people couldn't answer Q1!

&lt;body>This is all very interesting, but if you want to get accurate responses from a large number of people, I don't think you should be doing surveys on Hatena. &lt;BR>&lt;BR>There are other platforms like Slad or whatever, and I think the survey technique is fundamentally wrong. &lt;BR>&lt;BR>Oh, the ethics of those who are outraged are another matter. &lt;/body>
