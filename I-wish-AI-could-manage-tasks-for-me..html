<p>Summary (also made by Turbo)</p>
<ul>
<li>Need more information on task list</li>
<li>Questions to clarify the purpose of the task and questions to define done need to be asked.</li>
<li>Consider developing a task list management feature that allows users to ask questions using a chatbot.</li>
<li>Ask users to enter tasks that they need to do but have been putting off because they are not motivated to do them, and ask questions to clarify next actions.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/> What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/> I’m vaguely thinking that it would be nice if AI could manage tasks for us, so it could be more detailed.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/> If you had an AI to manage tasks, would you be able to think about what exactly you would want it to do?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/> I think TODO lists tend to be written with one task per line, and the format makes it difficult to retain enough context to execute the task over time, I want to do something about this.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/> I see, since the context of the task is lost in a format like a TODO list, would you consider an AI function to solve that?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/> The list needs to be compact for high listability, but detailed information is needed when focusing on a single task. If this detailed information is already written, there should be a view to quickly see it, and if not, we need to help with the language.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/> Specifically, are you saying that the problem with current task management is that the TODO list lacks detail and context is sometimes lost, and you want to think about AI features that would solve that problem?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/> Yes, a list with one task per line is not enough information.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/> To solve the problem of “one task per line list is not enough information,” what features are needed to enable AI to provide more detailed and contextual information, such as breaking down tasks, determining next actions, clarifying objectives, and defining workarounds?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/> AI does not provide the information. It is either in the human or not yet, and the human needs to find it and put it into words.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/> As you point out, the AI does not provide the information, but the human needs to find the details and context of the task and put it into words, but what questions would be helpful to acquire the information needed to do so?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/> What do you hope will happen to you by doing this?” This is a question that clarifies the purpose of the task. What will happen when this is done? This is a question that defines done. How is it done? would answer a very distant goal, so it is better to ask about the end of the task.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/> What is the point of doing this task?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/> Why am I doing this task? It is because I am happy to be more productive when I can manage my own tasks more smoothly, and it will be a good contribution to other people in the world when it becomes a system that can be used by others.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/> What exactly do you want to do to make that task management smoother?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/> It would be nice to have a system that I and others could easily use.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/> What would you like to make readily available as a system?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/> Maybe a chatbot that asks questions about tasks.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/> What questions would you like to be able to ask regarding chatbots?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/> I want to give them a task list first and then allow them to ask questions about that task list.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/> What features would be needed to implement a chatbot that asks questions about a task list?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/> If there is a chatbot read/write outliner with API, I think it would be a good idea to let it maintain the data.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/> If a chatbot is given the ability to manage a task list, what specific operations will it be able to perform?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/> Read the tasklict and ask questions about it.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/> What questions should I ask about the content of the task list?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/> You mean how to take the first step? You’re certainly not being very specific there. Let’s be more specific and assume, for example, that the task list just says “tax return”.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/> What questions should we ask about the task of “filing a tax return?”
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/> “How do I complete this?” “Submit it via eTax and you’re done.”
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/> Can you tell me what steps I need to take to submit via eTax?”
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/> Must open the eTax page and enter the information requested
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/> What are the fields regarding the information to be entered?”
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/> Income and payer information and expenses
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/> What more specific information is needed regarding the “income and payer information and expenses” information mentioned by the user?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/> Hmmm. The question is subtle, but in short, I believe you needed the amount, name and location for each payer, I’d have to look at the eTax site to remember the details.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/> Where can I find the required amount, name, and location information for each payer on the eTax site?”
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/> I kind of think “press that button around there and it will come up” but I can’t explain it clearly. Maybe we could make it a Next Action to confirm that. A good question to ask of a task is, “What is the Next Action?” and when it’s unclear, you can ask peripheral questions until it’s clear.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/> If the question is unclear, a question for the task is, “What is your Next Action?” and if it is unclear, is it better to ask a peripheral question until it is clarified?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/> It doesn’t. First, have the user enter “Tasks I need to do but haven’t had the motivation to do and am putting off. Next, ask, “What is the next action for this task? Next, ask the user, “What is the next action for this task? Usually, users in this situation do not know what the next action is, so they cannot answer the question. Then I ask, “Let me know if you think of anything else,” and ask other questions to clarify the task. The user comes up with a next action after talking about it, so I say, “Let’s do that! and return it to them.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/> What exactly do you want to do for the “tasks you need to do but haven’t had the motivation to do and have been putting off” that the user wants to accomplish?</p>
