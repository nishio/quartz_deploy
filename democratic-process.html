<p>What do we mean by a “democratic process”?
By “democratic process,” we mean a process in which a broadly representative group of people(A) exchange opinions, engage in deliberative discussions,(B) and ultimately decide on an outcome via a transparent decision making process.(C) There are many ways such a process could be structured—we encourage applicants to be innovative, building off known methodologies, and coming up with wholly new approaches. Examples of creative approaches that inspire us include Wikipedia, Twitter Community Notes, DemocracyNext, Platform Assemblies, MetaGov, RadicalxChange, People Powered, Collective Response Systems, and pol.is. Another notable ongoing effort is led by the Collective Intelligence Project (CIP), with whom we are partnering on public input to AI, contributing to their upcoming Alignment Assemblies. We also encourage applicants to envision how AI could enhance the democratic process. For example, AI could enable more efficient communication among numerous people.  --- <a href="./Democratic-Inputs-to-AI" class="internal alias" data-slug="Democratic-Inputs-to-AI">Democratic Inputs to AI</a></p>

<p>A: How one selects the group of participants is a critical design question. Part of this grant challenge lies in determining questions about participation. For instance, policy questions involving minority groups may require an increased representation of group members, while questions about the impact of technology on children might necessitate the involvement of domain experts such as educators and psychologists. Moreover, certain questions might be better suited for responses from populations within specific geographical boundaries in order to address localized policy issues.</p>

<p>B: Deliberation can be described as a process that uncovers opinions, helping the discussants understand each other’s views and reconsider and update their viewpoints. Well-designed deliberation ensures that arguments are well understood by all sides, and are based on people’s values rather than superficial misunderstandings. Successful deliberation results in participants reaching a higher level of consensus, and/or reaching deeper levels of understanding for differing perspectives.
