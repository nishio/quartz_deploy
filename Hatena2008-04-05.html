- int80? When an interrupt is applied, the contents of the registers are saved and passed to the kernel for processing, but the performance is bad because all the registers are stored and restored after the process is finished. However, since sysenter does not save the kernel, you can put only what you need in the stack and restore only what you need.

Hmmm? There's no &quot;Hello&quot; literal to begin with, is there?&quot; I wonder if the &quot;Hello&quot; string or the reference to printf is somewhere else in a constant table or something.

- Vista's blue screen is translucent and gradient.

- 10:56 I've reached the point where I can watch the standard output of the child process and play the specified sound when a particular pattern of strings appears. The spur-of-the-moment project, as is typical at training camps, is over, and it's back to ActionScript.

- It turns out that Rascut, like sed, blocks at the point where it reads the standard output of the child process. Disappointing.

- Option -t in -otool to display the text section and -d to display the data section
- No objdump.
- I did a hexdump -C a.out and it was in there.
- I did strings a.out and got it right.
- It seems that it is in there but just not being captured properly by otool. I wonder if there is some option that is different.


- If I downloaded a Zip file on my Mac and unzipped it and found a single executable file, I would start it thinking it was an installer, which is a Windows habit, but it usually isn't. Cmd+N to open a new Finder and copy it to Applications. Copy to Applications.

-display the path in the title bar of each window in the finder - yes > /dev/null
--http://d.hatena.ne.jp/elim/20080403/show_the_path_in_the_windows_title
- I see that when I killall Finder, the desktop icons disappear too. So the transparent window is at the bottom.
- I can see the POSIX path in the title bar, but I guess I can't copy and paste this. on Windows, I can use Explorer favorites and WSH to do bookmarklet-like things, but what if I want to extend the Finder on a Mac?

I lost to hayamiz in both bowling and tennis. At any rate, if you don't hit a rocket serve, it will return to a position where you can't hit it 100% of the time, and it seems to be able to aim at &quot;a position where it will go out if you hit it in a rush in the vanguard&quot;.

- I put in a bot that makes a sound when Mario increases or decreases when I say ++ or -- on the 86 camp channel.
-- I was saying who will be the first to figure out what's going on, and it was faultier. faultier++.
-- hayamiz does not understand the situation and plays itkz audio, etc. hayamiz --.

-Mac's Terminal.app is convenient to create tabs, but I wonder if it is possible to rename the tabs. I forget which tab is which.

-An iPod touch was broken, for example, because sotarok, who understood that sound would be made when he spoke in the 86 development camp chat, put up a +++ barrage of bullets.

-Eating dinner, etc.

-The command to copy in the Mac console is pbcopy, short for paste board.

-A program that reads the standard output of a child process, line by line, expects the readline to complete each time a newline comes in, but some programs block until the program terminates and the standard output is closed, and some don't.
-- What is not
--- cat
--- ruby p
-- To be
--- python print, sys.stdout.write
--- ruby logger
--- sed
-Rascut does not read well because it uses logger
-P after the logger output will also read the logger output itself.
-Theories of what flushes output and what does not
-Adding stdout.flush to a Python script that does not show up will make it show up.
-It is probably impossible to prompt a child process to flush, or for the recipient of a pipe to prompt the sender to flush.
-I thought it would be useful to have a script that would look at the standard output and play a sound or growl if it contained a particular pattern, but I was not so naive. Hmmm... Let's give up for now.

The flow of creating a handy server for local use that spits out -crossdomain.xml in web.py.

I wonder if it is possible to change the text that appears on the tabs in -Terminal.app.

-At least we have made the first step in what we were going to do.

-I was actually supposed to hear the sound of Mario's death when I get an error in rascut.

-It's already 26:00. I'm sleepy. Let's go to bed.

||&lt;
The same is true if you def quux. It seems that the name used in a method of a class without modification is first checked to see if it is a local variable, then traced to its own method, then to a method of the parent class, and so on, stopping at Object.

In Python, an unqualified name checks local variables, traverses to the outer scope, and stops at the global (module scope). self.quux traverses to its own members, to members of the parent class, and so on, stopping at object.

Java allows you to omit this, but I wonder what is going on. I thought that if you created nested classes, you could access variables in the outer classes without modification.

By the way, I was able to call it after modifying it with module_function, but do I have to do it this way? Is there an easier way?

      var loader:URLLoader = new URLLoader();
      loader.addEventListener(
	Event.COMPLETE, loadCompleteHandler
      );
      loader.load(new URLRequest(url));
    }
    public function loadCompleteHandler(e:Event):void{
      log(e.target.data);
    }
  }
}
||&lt;


And the other is the server code using web.py. It runs on the local 8080 port.

>|python|
import web

urls = [
#    &quot;/&quot;, &quot;Index&quot;,
    &quot;/crossdomain.xml&quot;, &quot;CrossDomainXML&quot;,
    &quot;/api/(.+)&quot;, &quot;Api&quot;,
]

CROSS_DOMAIN_XML = &quot;&quot;&quot;&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?>
&lt;!DOCTYPE cross-domain-policy SYSTEM &quot;http://www.macromedia.com/xml/dtds/cross-domain-policy.dtd&quot;>
&lt;cross-domain-policy>
    &lt;allow-access-from domain=&quot;localhost:3001&quot; />
&lt;/cross-domain-policy>
&quot;&quot;&quot;
class CrossDomainXML(object):
    def GET(self):
        print CROSS_DOMAIN_XML

class Api(object):
    def GET(self, value):
        print value

 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    web.webapi.internalerror = web.debugerror
    web.run(urls, globals(), web.reloader)
||&lt;

Now you can throw a request from Flash to /api/foo on the server, and the returned &quot;foo&quot; will be displayed in the Firebug console.
We are happy and satisfied. Static files can be delivered with rascut -m, and cgi can be added under the api. The first step of prototyping is done.

&lt;body>If you want to use constants, you could make them constants. &lt;BR>&lt;BR>Or you can refer to a local variable in the outer scope by setting the class definition to class_eval and the method definition to define_method&lt;/body>.

It's the same reason why you can't refer to a top-level local variable from within a &lt;body> method. I also think the Python way is more natural, but in Ruby the local variable scope is broken by class and def expressions anyway. &lt;br>&lt;br>Although already mentioned, constants will work as expected. &lt;/body>
