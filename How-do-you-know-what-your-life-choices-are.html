If you don’t know the choices, you can’t make those choices and the quality of your decision making will go down. Then knowing “life choices” should lead to a better life. So how do we know what those “life choices” are?</p>

Participation in SecHack365
↑ I learned about SH365 at an LT group event.
↑I found out about the LT meeting itself through Twitter with a good friend of mine! I found out about it through the process of “Let’s meet off-line with people I’m good friends with on Twitter!
↑I don’t even remember why I started Twitter.</p>

The reason I chose this option was “because I had a good teacher at a technical college who connected me with a company” and the reason I chose this option was “because my parents recommended it to me because of its good job placement rate”. This may be a bit similar to Mr. Nishio’s example.</p>

After that, I became interested in foreign countries and languages and started working abroad. The trigger was when I attended a drinking party with my labmates and met someone from that robotics circle and was invited to be in charge of programming.</p>

He thought it would be interesting to go abroad, so he also participated in an international internship program during his first year of his master’s degree. That helped him improve his language skills, and he decided to work abroad at a later date.</p>
