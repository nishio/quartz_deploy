&lt;hr>

&lt;a href='http://amazonuki.appspot.com/'>Amazon.co.uk - the site for cheap DVDs on Amazon.co.uk -&lt;/a>


As announced yesterday, I made a service and rehabbed it to the point where I could make it in one night, just to list it with Japanese yen when I put in my ASIN. and write about 5 lines in urls.py. And a template that is about the size of a single HTML repetition.


It's charming that even CDs and MacBook Pros are registered, even though the site says it's a cheap DVD introduction site. Well, anyone can register.

*1233393861*After an all-nighter
I worked all night to create a rehab service, published it, came home, went to bed, and when I woke up, it was broken as soon as I got up. I mean, none of the inputs were validated! I was like, &quot;This is not the way to do it! I was immediately seeing &quot;&quot;>&quot;&quot; being inputted. Fortunately, no harmful code was embedded.

So let's get right to it.
>|python|
    # validation
    import string
    if len(uk_asin) != 10: raise RuntimeError(&quot;Invalid ASIN&quot;)
    acceptable_letter = string.ascii_uppercase + string.digits
    if not all(c in acceptable_letter for c in uk_asin):
        raise RuntimeError(&quot;Invalid ASIN&quot;)
||&lt;
What a code I wrote. You should have written it from the beginning, yourself.

*1233399693* Is it time to mention the example project?
I had a chance to read the source code of one of the systems before, and it was so bad. It is hard to believe that the system is working just fine with that terrible code. We were talking about it over lunch today, and it seems that people don't know about it, so I'll try to explain how bad it is as much as I can.


First of all, there are roughly 37.5 million lines of source code, of which only 3% function properly, and there are systems that achieve the same level of functionality with only a tenth of the source code, so it is no exaggeration to say that the code for that system is garbage.


As a programmer, I'm wondering how the project got into such a state, but, well, like many projects, no one knows the truth. But, well, I am sure that there was a lot of copying and pasting going on, judging from the fact that there were what looked like copies of actual functioning code scattered all over the place. That and about 40% of the garbage code is not even &quot;copy and paste, rewrite and implement new functionality&quot;. Just copy and paste and leave it at that. It is not useful at all. (*2)


The Python code explains
>|python|
def func_a(...):
    # code of A
    # code of A
    # code of A
||&lt;
The copy and paste is done where there is a function called
>|python|
def func_a(...):
    # code of A
def func_b(...):
    # code of B
    # code of B
    # code of B
    # code of A
    # code of A
||&lt;
For example, func_a opens a file but does not read it, or creates an SQL query but does not issue it, or some such useless code. It's not written in Python, but this is the level of quality I'm talking about. It is unbelievable that it is working properly, isn't it?


The reason why it continues to work without stopping is because the designers were either mad or crazy and designed the framework to &quot;call all functions that satisfy certain conditions in a module,&quot; so that even if there is a broken copy of A, if even one copy of A that is not broken remains, the functionality is not lost. If there is a copy of A that is broken, but there is still one copy of A that is not broken, the functionality is not lost. Well, it's not 100% safe. And because of this design, it does not matter if there are a lot of broken functions that no longer satisfy the conditions. In a web app, for example, accessing /add_item will bring up the add item screen, but actually accessing /append_item will bring up the old, now non-functional add screen.


Oh yeah, the version control of the source code is also terrible. Or rather, there is no version control. There is no repository. If you want to modify the code, you have to ask someone to copy the code. Then, they tweak it. If the code gets broken and stops working, there is no one to debug it, so you delete the whole code and get a new copy. Of course, if there are copies of important code all over the place, it is more likely to be taken over because it is harder to break. Recently, there is a saying: &quot;Have two copies of the source code that are almost the same. When you take over the code, you should get one copy from each of the two people. (*3) When merging the two sets of code, they often merge the two copies of the same code set, so they often put in two copies of the same code set, or even lose it. For example, one function originally accepted four types of input formats, but before they knew it, it had been reduced to two, and they had no choice but to copy one of them and make a third one, and in some cases, they actually went back to four... (*4)


I don't know how this is working. I wonder if someone could refactor it. Impossible?

&lt;body>I thought it was interesting that the reference was gene-related. If the code is 97% junk, like the human genome, it would be interesting to see how mutating a comment (or inadvertently making an editing error) would cause it to behave completely differently. However, since a program is originally designed to optimize for a certain purpose, it will never be better than the result, and will probably fall apart. However, from the perspective of artificial life (genetic programming), I think it is an interesting code that includes diversity.
