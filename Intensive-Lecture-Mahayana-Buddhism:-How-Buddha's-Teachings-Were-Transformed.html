Lecture 6: Where Is Mahayana Buddhism Headed?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I now know I can call myself a Buddhist.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is encouraging that we can now explain the rationale for this (see below: Changing the definition of a broken monk).</li>
<li>Flow up to now
<ul>
<li>1: When I was a child, I somehow got involved in Buddhism by “participating in the rituals my parents were doing,” and I vaguely perceived it as “Buddhism” X.</li>
<li>2: As you grow up and become more clear about your idea Y, you begin to think “this idea X is different from my idea Y”.</li>
<li>3: As I learned more about Buddhism, I began to feel that “there should be a distinction between the Buddhism commonly seen in Japan and <a href="./the-Buddhism-of" class="internal alias" data-slug="the-Buddhism-of">the Buddhism of</a> Buddha.

</ul>
</li>
<li>I learned that (3) has the name “<a href="./Mahayana-non-Buddhist-theory" class="internal alias" data-slug="Mahayana-non-Buddhist-theory">Mahayana non-Buddhist theory</a>”.
<ul>
<li>p.102</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Tominaga Nakamoto, a historian of thought from the mid-Edo period (1603-1868), argued that all Buddhist scriptures were not based on the teachings of a single historical Buddha, but were established by successive additions of later generations in response to the religious needs of each era / Mahayana non-Buddhist theory / Today it is a common theory in the academic world</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>At the time, there was fierce opposition from the Buddhist community, but Nobunaga Motoya praised it highly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Then the question, “Is today’s Buddhism, which is not the doctrine of the Buddha, Buddhism?” is Buddhism?
<ul>
<li>This is related to the “redefinition of a broken monk” by <a href="./King-Ashoka" class="internal alias" data-slug="King-Ashoka">King Ashoka</a> in the 3rd century B.C.</li>
<li>p.24</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>In an old book titled “Māyāsāgi Rituals,” it is clearly stated, “Even if there are those in the Sangha who insist on a different interpretation from that of the Buddha and there is a dispute, as long as they live together in the same place and perform group rituals together, they are not broken monks. If they begin to perform the rituals separately, then they are broken monks.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the Buddhist philosophical treatise “Kusha-ron,” which was written much later than the Māyāsāgi-ryū, there are two definitions of a monk-breaker: “There are two kinds of monk-breakers,” he writes. There are two kinds of monks. The first is to teach doctrines that are contrary to the Buddha’s teachings, which is called havorin (chakravada). The other is to refrain from performing rituals together, which is called hakkoma (karma veda).</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>In other words, the definition of “if you participate in the same group ritual, you are one of us”.</li>
<li>(Of course, since this is a story after the Buddha’s death, there are those who do not recognize it. I take the position that “when I explicitly call it ‘the Buddhism of Buddha,’ I am speaking in the narrow sense that does not recognize this, and when I call it ‘Buddhism,’ I am speaking in the broad sense that recognizes this, and it is the latter that I take refuge in.)</li>
</ul>

<li>Participation in one’s own collective rituals
