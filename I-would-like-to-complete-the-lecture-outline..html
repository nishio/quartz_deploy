<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>I would like to complete the lecture outline.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What kind of “lecture outline” is this “lecture outline”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>After briefly mentioning that I gave a talk of the same name in 2014, followed by a well-received book containing the content of that talk in a number of years, I will briefly explain what information will be conveyed in this talk and how it will benefit the audience.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What kind of “audience” is this “audience”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>middle and high school students, most of whom take the college entrance exam and enter college.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What kind of “middle/high school student” is this “middle/high school student”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Well, if you measure it by logical thinking skills, I’d say you’re in the top 10% of your age group.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What kind of “thinking ability” is this “thinking ability”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Ability to solve a problem that is known to be solvable in time and whose solution fits within the scope of a defined curriculum, when explicitly given as “this is the problem to solve”.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What kind of “curriculum” is this “curriculum”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>That’s a choice of problem-solving methods, and in the case of the exam, that has been limited to a fairly narrow range.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What is the “alternative”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>In solving problems in life, I often didn’t realize there was such an option! In life’s problem-solving, there are often times when you are surprised to find out that you have such a choice! You may think that it is unfair that you were not told in advance that you had such a choice, but the assumption that you are given all the choices in advance is wrong.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What else can you tell us about that “option”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Therefore, it is important to recognize that there are many options other than the ones we are given or can see, and to try to increase our own options.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>How do you know what your “options” are?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>It’s just a coincidence, or they hear about it from someone else, or they are asked to do it byname, or something like that. Few are widely known.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What kind of “Jinden” is this “Jinden”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Watching interesting people doing interesting things, I wonder if it comes from people who are highly sensitive to new options.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>Where are these “options” located?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Aside from that, the story so far raises some issues, but does not solve anything by listening to the lecture. I could touch on the topic of unexplored juniors, or I could talk about “making things” including programming.

<p>Watching interesting people doing interesting things, I wonder if it comes from people who are highly sensitive to new options.</p>

</li>
<li>Where is this “choice”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Ultimately, we can say that any choice is in the mind, because if the subject of the decision does not realize that it is a choice, it does not function as a choice. And it can be ignored unconsciously.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What does that “option” look like?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>It seems like a branch of the path. Oh, it seems to be related to the <a href="./Branches-of-the-Path-and-Teaching-Relationships" class="internal alias" data-slug="Branches-of-the-Path-and-Teaching-Relationships">Branches of the Path and Teaching Relationships</a> I talked about at Toyota Tech.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What kind of “branching” is this “branching”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>In other words, there will be more people to teach each other if we take different paths rather than walking on the same rails as others.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What kind of “rail” is that “rail”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>The rails of life, I’m on the rails at this point in my life attending a progressive school. I don’t go so far as to say that you should go off that rail at this point in your life, but at the same age, for example, there’s an emerging force, N High School, where you have other options.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What is it that you value?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>I wonder if it would be good to communicate that there are more choices and that there is no such thing as the “right choice” for this, that we can know after the fact whether a choice was the right one or not, and that the power to make that choice and to recognize good choices can only be acquired by using it, so it’s good to be aware of it…
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>Where does this “choice” come from?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>It can exist in a form that is difficult to see around you, but you can find it with your trained eyes, or you can create an environment in advance that makes it easy to find.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>

<p>I wonder if it would be good to be able to tell them that there are more choices and that, for that matter, there is no such thing as the “right choice” and that they can know after the fact whether they made the right choice or not, and that the ability to make that choice and recognize good choices is not acquired without using it, so it is good to be aware of it. …</p>

</li>
<li>What would you like to see happen regarding this “option”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>More would be good. Not too many and not too confusing.
