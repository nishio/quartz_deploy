<li>Becoming a <a href="./long-seller" class="internal alias" data-slug="long-seller">long seller</a> = continuing to sell over the long term (p.15)</li>
<li>Books become less successful as time passes after publication.

<p>While the development of LLM (Large Language Models) has accelerated information gathering and knowledge acquisition, the importance of chewing over the information obtained and constructing one‚Äôs own model remains unchanged.

<p>‚ÄúMemory training‚Äù techniques are still important skills for humans today, even as AI has dramatically improved our ability to remember and retrieve information.

<ul>
<li>The storage of information was now delegated to machines. The skills of structuring and applying knowledge to use those tools efficiently became important.</li>

<p>‚ÄúEfficient reading‚Äù skills are even more important now that the <a href="./flood-of-information" class="internal alias" data-slug="flood-of-information">flood of information</a> has further accelerated.

<li>Recently, I have been reading papers to Claude 3 Opus. This chapter, which reconsiders the ‚Äúact of reading‚Äù and the ‚Äúpurpose of reading‚Äù in order to read efficiently, will serve as a foundation for considering changes in ‚Äúhow to read‚Äù as tools change.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúPutting thoughts together‚Äù is still an important inherent human ability, even with the development of language models such as ChatGPT. We are expected to critically examine machine-generated information and form <a href="./our-own-ideas" class="internal alias" data-slug="our-own-ideas">our own ideas</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>You are absolutely right, LLM has allowed us to generate a lot of material for brainstorming ideas, etc. We need guidelines on how to ‚Äúput it all together‚Äù. We need guidelines on how to ‚Äúput that material together‚Äù.</li>

<p>The process of ‚Äúcoming up with an idea‚Äù is an area where human creativity can be demonstrated, even today with the development of AI. Even though machines can assist with ideation, it is still the job of humans to ultimately create <a href="./valuable-ideas" class="internal alias" data-slug="valuable-ideas">valuable ideas</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>It is important to consider what constitutes a ‚Äúworthwhile idea.‚Äù An idea that is not implemented has no value, nor does an idea that is not feasible have value. The process of nurturing the seeds of ideas that will lead to future value will become increasingly important.</li>

<ul>
<li>When major changes occur in the world, we cannot be sure that what was once considered ‚Äúgood to learn this‚Äù will continue to be useful in the future. Since no one knows what the future holds, we cannot leave it to others; we must choose for ourselves.</li>

<p>Overall, the ideas and skills presented in ‚ÄúThe Engineer‚Äôs Art of Intellectual Production‚Äù can be evaluated as a good book that provides important suggestions for <a href="./surviving-the-AI-age" class="internal alias" data-slug="surviving-the-AI-age">surviving the AI age</a>.

<li>The time has come when such texts can be produced at low cost by using LLM.
<ul>
<li>If a person reading this sentence thinks it is interesting, then the value of ‚Äúinteresting‚Äù has been produced.</li>
<li>If people who read this text find it compelling and buy the book, it means that cash value has been produced by shining a light on the intellectual output of the past.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I find the output itself interesting, as well as the process of ‚ÄúI let LLM read the book and this output came out‚Äù.
<ul>
<li>This is a real example of ‚ÄúIntellectual Production with LLM</li>
<li>The ‚ÄúEngineer‚Äôs Art of Intellectual Production‚Äù was born out of observations of the intellectual production process that led to the writing of a book, ‚ÄúThe Art of Supporting Coding.‚Äù</li>
<li>New intellectual products are now emerging from observations of the process of ‚Äúintellectual production using LLM</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Changes after writing</p>
<ul>
<li>First to talk about the evolution of the methodology of intellectual production and the changes from 2018 to now
<ul>
<li>Otherwise, we lack the prerequisite knowledge to talk about the present and the future.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There are three major categories.
<ul>
<li>From Blog to Scrapbox</li>
<li>From Paper KJ Method to Kozaneba</li>
<li>Development of LLM</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>From Blog to Scrapbox</p>
<ul>
<li>I‚Äôve been blogging since the early 2000s.
<ul>
<li>In 2000, Google Search started its service in Japanese. If you write notes of what you learned on the Internet, you can find them with a Google search when you think, ‚ÄúThat thing I did before, what was it?</li>
<li>I started out with a personal note as a motivation, but many people have thanked me for it, and with the development of social networking sites, it has become easier to notice mentions.</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>If you publish your materials on the Internet, they will be mentioned on social networking sites from time to time, triggering a reminder. The higher the social demand, the more frequently they are mentioned, and thus the more frequently they are reviewed and improved. (p.141)</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>(I personally call them ‚Äú<a href="./Social-Triggers" class="internal alias" data-slug="Social-Triggers">Social Triggers</a>,‚Äù although the book doesn‚Äôt mention it.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>3 Advantages
<ul>
<li>Advantages of writing: it won‚Äôt disappear (p. 149)</li>
<li>Advantages of writing digitally: searchable (p. 20)</li>
<li>Benefits of writing in a public forum: social value generation (p. 141)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Scrapbox (Note: Scrapbox changed its name to Cosense in May 2024, but will be referred to as Scrapbox in this talk)
<ul>
<li>Started trying Scrapbox in 2017 while writing ‚ÄúThe Intellectual Production of Engineers‚Äù and really liked it by the time of publication in 2018</li>
<li>but due to the structure, it was not possible to add a chapter on Scrapbox to the book (just barely mentioned in a footnote on p. 175).</li>
<li>As of 2024, approximately 20,000 articles, or 60 books worth of text, have been written in Scrapbox</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Scrapbox Features
<ul>
<li>Link-specific notation: simply enclose a link in <code>[]</code> to make it a link. Can express relationships between information at low cost.</li>
<li>Links to non-existent pages: Links can be created even if the page to which they refer does not yet exist. This facilitates knowledge expansion.</li>
<li>Automatic fuzzy search: automatically searches when creating links and suggests pages that may be relevant. Helpful for finding knowledge relevance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>These features accelerate Scrapbox‚Äôs representation of knowledge as a network structure.
<ul>
<li>The more accumulation accumulates, the more benefits.</li>
<li>In the early stages when there is little accumulation, it is difficult to realize the benefits because the network is not fully formed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The advantages of Scrapbox
<ul>
<li>Low-cost stocking of associations that come to mind for you.
<ul>
<li>These <a href="./stocks-of-associations" class="internal alias" data-slug="stocks-of-associations">stocks of associations</a> will grow <a href="./Knowledge-Network" class="internal alias" data-slug="Knowledge-Network">Knowledge Network</a>.</li>
<li>Like a plant, it branches out and grows lushly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Follow the links and re-discover what you thought in the past.
- <a href="./Scrapbox-reminds-me-of-what-I've-forgotten." class="internal alias" data-slug="Scrapbox-reminds-me-of-what-I've-forgotten.">Scrapbox reminds me of what I‚Äôve forgotten.</a>
<ul>
<li>The link that spread <a href="./Expand-the-pertinence-of-useful-concepts" class="internal alias" data-slug="Expand-the-pertinence-of-useful-concepts">Expand the pertinence of useful concepts</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Encountering descriptions of the past that are relevant to what you are thinking about now will give you new insights.
<ul>
<li>Revisit past experiences from your current point of view</li>
<li>Comparing past and present experiences as ‚Äúsimilarities‚Äù leads to deeper understanding and abstraction</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The more important things are mentioned repeatedly, the fuller the page.
<ul>
<li>Social triggers were more about luck than others.</li>
<li>Scrapbox causes interaction with ‚Äú<a href="./Past-self" class="internal alias" data-slug="Past-self">Past self</a>‚Äù.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>From Paper KJ Method to Kozaneba</p>

<li>LENCHI_FOREWORD
<ul>
<li>We are in the midst of a dramatic evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs), AI that understands and generates language, and LLMs such as ChatGPT have the potential to go beyond mere conversation and writing tools to transform intellectual production itself.</li>
<li>For many years, I have been working to improve the intellectual productivity of individuals and teams; in my 2013 book, ‚ÄúThe Art Behind Coding,‚Äù I rethought the intellectual production of programming from the aspect of language, and in my 2018 book, ‚ÄúThe Intellectual Production of Engineers,‚Äù I tried to present a universal technique that is not limited to engineering, but is applicable to all intellectual In 2018, I attempted to present a universal technique that is applicable to all intellectual production, not just engineering.</li>
<li>As an extension of this awareness, LLMs have suddenly appeared before my eyes as an aid, and sometimes even a substitute, for human intellectual production. This should be an opportunity to rethink the nature of intellectual production itself. As someone who has been looking at the relationship between language and intellectual production and exploring its universal techniques, I cannot help but see the advent of LLM as an excellent opportunity to advance my own research in a big way.</li>
<li>In this book, we will explore the possibilities of practically using LLM in our own intellectual production. My skills as a programmer, my curiosity as a researcher, and my sense of language as an author. I, a man of many faces, will share with you the process of exploring a new way of intellectual production through dialogue and collaboration with LLM.</li>
<li>This book is neither a book of know-how filled with examples nor a book of grandiose theories. Rather, it is a record of one professional‚Äôs struggle to evolve his own intellectual production by ‚Äúmastering‚Äù LLM, and should be called a trail of an experiment to reexamine the essence of intellectual production and create a new form of it.</li>
<li>Now, let‚Äôs take LLM with us and break new ground in intellectual production.</li>
</ul>

<p>You are a talented editor. I am the author of the book ‚ÄúThe Intellectual Production of Engineers‚Äù I am planning a book on intellectual production using LLM. Assist me.</p>

<ul>
<li>Roles and objectives are clearly stated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>It‚Äôs cliche. The reason why it is cliche is because there is no necessity that is unique to the author writing this book. More likely, you don‚Äôt seem to know the author‚Äôs information, so I will give it to you.

<ul>
<li>Commodity stale content proposed because it doesn‚Äôt give specific information, specific knowledge.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>The author‚Äôs name is Yasukazu Nishio, although I think the policy is fine with that. Self-introduction data is attached. PASTED <a href="./self-introduction" class="internal" data-slug="self-introduction">self-introduction</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Giving knowledge.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>In this case, I don‚Äôt think the ‚Äúlet‚Äôs make chapter headings first‚Äù approach that is common in traditional book planning is not a good idea. Instead, I think it is better to start with a small start and sprint, and use LLM as an example by using it to its fullest in the process.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>major policy statement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>An emergent approach to verbalizing our know-how as ‚Äúcraftsmen of intellectual production who master LLM‚Äù, that‚Äôs a good phrase. In addition, this chat itself will be used as an example. I think an appropriate start for the book would be a short preface that can be read by people without context, followed by a brief introduction and examples of real-world examples.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>major policy statement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>I think the way you‚Äôre going in is emo, but don‚Äôt think you should connect with the author‚Äôs past actions early on to show that something unique to this author will be written.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>major policy statement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Current Issues and Future</p>
<ul>
<li>Repeated searches or putting in too large content eats up context and causes amnesia.
<ul>
<li>This is a problem with the current chat UI design
<ul>
<li>Most people only perceive it as a chat and do not want to control the content of the context</li>
<li>So it‚Äôs not designed to do that.</li>
<li>Actually, ChatGPT allows tree exploration but it‚Äôs hard to use &amp; the playground allows you to delete some history but not in the chat UI.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Chat has been a tool for ‚Äúhuman-to-human communication‚Äù and not for editing the other person‚Äôs memory, etc.
<ul>
<li>In human conversation, it‚Äôs similar to discussing while writing on a whiteboard, or discussing while collaboratively editing the minutes of a meeting.</li>
<li>A UI will be needed where humans and LLMs can work together to gather and edit information to create a ‚Äúgood context‚Äù.</li>
<li>It‚Äôs probably closer to Scrapbox than chat</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(Or the context window will be 10<del>100 times larger and 10</del>100 times faster, eliminating the need for organization, or the LLM will organize better than humans without human help.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Convergence assistance needed.
<ul>
<li>Accelerated brainstorming with LLM is useful for divergent thinking
<ul>
<li>One person can have multiple points of view.</li>
<li>Related: [Not subjective or objective, but from the subjectivity of one to the subjectivity of many.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On the other hand, how to support convergent thinking in LLM is a challenge</li>
<li>Context broad LLM can help with purpose and contextual convergence (= variants of summarization)</li>
<li>There could be a combination of KJ legal methods and LLM to support convergent thinking.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Summary Development</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Just put an English paper on Claude and say ‚ÄúSummarize‚Äù and he will summarize it for you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Same for GPT4, but much different in output.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The word ‚Äúsummary‚Äù is too vague a term to specify what a human wants an LLM to do, and there is a wide range of interpretation among LLMs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The same LLM can vary a lot depending on how the prompt is written.</p>
<ul>
<li>Give Claude an audio transcription of the videoconference to ‚Äúsummarize‚Äù and ‚Äútake minutes.‚Äù</li>
<li>Hand them a paper and say, ‚ÄúSummarize it,‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs great about this paper?‚Äù ‚ÄúHow is it different from X?‚Äù</li>
<li>The ‚Äúinstructional verbalization skills‚Äù that allow you to output the information you want to get will make a big difference in effectiveness.</li>
