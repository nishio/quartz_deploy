<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/claude/icon" alt="claude.icon" height="19.5"/>This conversation log is a record of a new book project by Yasukazu Nishio. Nishio documents the process of developing a book project through actual interaction with LLMs in order to explore the possibilities of intellectual production using AI language models (LLMs).</p>
<p>This is the first part of this book, which will be presented as a practical example of intellectual production using LLM. By showing the author‚Äôs own use of LLM to conceptualize this book, the intent is to give readers a concrete idea of the possibilities of LLM.</p>
<p>During the dialogue, a general book proposal is initially presented, but Mr. Nishio describes it as ‚Äústale‚Äù and advises to make the content more unique based on his own background. He also suggests an emergent approach in which the structure of the book is gradually developed through practice, rather than deciding on the chapters first.</p>
<p>He also likes the phrase ‚Äúintellectual production artisans who master LLM‚Äù that was put forth through LLM, and decides to use the dialogue itself as an illustration of this book. The process of drafting and refining the ‚Äúpreface‚Äù to the book is also documented.</p>
<p>These series of interactions are a true demonstration of the intellectual production process using LLM, and will serve as a perfect example of the concept of this book. Readers will be able to experience the revolution in intellectual production brought about by LLM through this behind-the-scenes glimpse into the creation of this book.</p>

<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>You are a competent editor. I am the author of the book ‚ÄúThe Intellectual Production of Engineers‚Äù I am planning a book on intellectual production using LLM. Assist me.</p>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/claude/icon" alt="claude.icon" height="19.5"/>Yes, I would be happy to assist you in planning a book on intellectual production techniques using LLM. I will provide my ideas and suggestions, but I will leave the final decision to the author, Mr. Abe.</p>
<p>First of all, as for the proposed structure of the book, how about the following chapters?</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduction: What is LLM? Its Potential and Limitations</li>
<li>Chapter 1: Idea Generation with LLM</li>
<li>Chapter 2: LLM Improves Information Gathering and Research Efficiency</li>
<li>Chapter 3: Writing Tips Using LLM</li>
<li>Chapter 4: How to deepen your knowledge by interacting with LLMs</li>
<li>Chapter 5: Problem Solving Approaches Using LLM</li>
<li>Chapter 6: Tips for daily use of LLM</li>
<li>Final Chapter: The Future of LLM in Intellectual Production</li>
</ul>
<p>In each chapter, I think it would be good to explain intellectual production techniques useful for engineers, including specific examples of use, introduction of tools, and the author‚Äôs experiences.</p>
<p>As a feature of the book, it would be good to include many sample codes and conversation examples so that readers can actually try out LLM as they read along. In addition, it would be interesting if a repository related to the contents of the book could be opened on GitHub or other sites to encourage the community to share their knowledge.</p>
<p>Please let us know if you have any comments or requests regarding our proposal. We would be happy to give you more ideas in the process of fleshing out the project. Let‚Äôs work together to create a great book.</p>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>It is cliche. The reason why it is cliche is because there is no necessity that is unique to the author writing this book. More likely, you don‚Äôt seem to know the author‚Äôs information, so I will give it to you.</p>
<p>PASTED  <a href="./The-Intellectual-Production-of-Engineers-Author's-official-page" class="internal alias" data-slug="The-Intellectual-Production-of-Engineers-Author's-official-page">The Intellectual Production of Engineers Author‚Äôs official page</a></p>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/claude/icon" alt="claude.icon" height="19.5"/>Thank you for your suggestions. I will rethink the proposal again based on the author‚Äôs background information.</p>
<p>In his book ‚ÄúThe Intellectual Production of Engineers,‚Äù Mr. Abe has explained how to learn as an engineer, how to organize knowledge, and the importance of output. The book has been a long-seller, with many engineers enjoying the book‚Äôs content, and has been reprinted many times.</p>
<p>In this new book, while building on the intellectual production ideas established in the previous book, it may be a good idea to explore how intellectual production can be transformed by utilizing a new tool that has been rapidly developing in recent years: LLM.</p>
<p>In other words, the concept of this book is ‚ÄúHow will the ‚Äòintellectual production techniques of engineers‚Äô evolve with the advent of a new technology called LLM? The author himself will put it to practical use. Through this new approach to intellectual production, the author presents the thinking methods and techniques necessary for engineers of the future. This will be such an ambitious book.</p>
<p>We would like to revise the content of each chapter in line with this policy and include a wealth of examples of LLM applications to make the content more concrete and practical for the reader. How about the outline of the plan?</p>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>The author‚Äôs name is Yasukazu Nishio, although I think the policy is fine with that. Self-introduction data is attached.
PASTED  <a href="./self-introduction" class="internal" data-slug="self-introduction">self-introduction</a></p>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/claude/icon" alt="claude.icon" height="19.5"/>My apologies. We made a mistake with Mr. Nishio‚Äôs name. We have seen the attached self-introduction data and will make a new proposal.</p>
<p>D. at the young age of 24, Nishio has been engaged in research and development to improve individual and team productivity at Cybozu Labs since 2007. He is also well versed in improving productivity through the evolution of programming languages and published ‚ÄúThe Technology Behind Coding‚Äù in 2013. In 2014, he received a Master‚Äôs degree in Management of Technology and published ‚ÄúNatural Language Processing with word2vec‚Äù. He is also a member of the board of directors of Mito, a general incorporated association, and a specific associate professor at the Tokyo Institute of Technology, and continues to be active on the front lines.</p>
<p>We believe that Mr. Nishio is the reason why he is able to write this book so persuasively. Based on the ideas cultivated in ‚ÄúThe Intellectual Production Techniques of Engineers,‚Äù how will he utilize LLM, which has evolved remarkably in recent years, in his own intellectual production? As a researcher and practitioner, I will pioneer a new way of intellectual production. This is where our unrivaled originality lies.</p>
<p>The proposed structure of each chapter could include the following</p>
<p>Introduction: Where We Are Now in Intellectual Production and the New Horizon of LLM
Chapter 1: Idea Generation with LLM
Chapter 2: LLM Accelerates Information Gathering and Research
Chapter 3: Using LLMs as Partners in Intellectual Dialogue
Chapter 4: Writing Techniques with LLM
Chapter 5: Using LLM in Programming
Chapter 6: Designing a New Intellectual Production Ecosystem
End: Beyond LLM - A Vision of the Future of Intellectual Production</p>
<p>It would be interesting if you could develop your argument by linking it to your own research and practice, and also including examples from Cybozu Labs. We hope that you will use this book to present your philosophy and methodology on how to utilize the new technology of LLM in intellectual production.</p>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>In this case, I don‚Äôt think the ‚Äúlet‚Äôs make chapter headings first‚Äù approach that is common in traditional book planning is not a good idea. Instead, I think it is better to start with a small start and sprint, and use LLM as an example by using it to its fullest in the process.</p>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/claude/icon" alt="claude.icon" height="19.5"/>You‚Äôre right, if we‚Äôre going to talk about the nature of intellectual production using LLM, the book production process itself should be an example of that.</p>
<p>Why not review the planning process itself and take the following approach?</p>
<ul>
<li>First, Mr. Nishio himself will start small intellectual production using LLM (idea notes, blog posts, program code fragments, etc.)</li>
<li>The dialogue log will be recorded as a ‚Äúreal-life record of intellectual collaboration with LLM‚Äù at that time.</li>
<li>Gradually expand the area and scale of LLM use (writing papers, planning projects, designing programs, etc.) while experiencing small successes</li>
<li>Compile and generalize the insights and methodologies gained in the process of such practices.</li>
<li>Research not only your own experiences, but also the use cases of other LLM users to incorporate diverse knowledge.</li>
<li>To provide a vision of the future of intellectual production using LLM and make recommendations for its realization.</li>
</ul>
<p>This process will provide you with compelling and liveable insights. The core of this book will be the practical knowledge of intellectual production using LLM itself. Of course, the knowledge gained from this process needs to be systematized and generalized as a methodology, but I think it is important to take the stance that practice must come first.</p>
<p>The structure of the book is also not a traditional planned approach, but rather an image that gradually emerges through the accumulation of records of intellectual production practices. While accumulating dialogue logs between Mr. Nishio and LLM, records of trial and error, case studies, etc., the book will verbalize the know-how of an ‚Äúintellectual production craftsman who is proficient in using LLM. Such an emergent approach seems more suitable for this theme.</p>
<p>What do you think? We would be happy to hear your opinion.</p>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>An emergent approach to <a href="./verbalizing-know-how" class="internal alias" data-slug="verbalizing-know-how">verbalizing know-how</a> as ‚Äú<a href="./an" class="internal" data-slug="an">an</a> intellectual production craftsman <a href="./who" class="internal" data-slug="who">who</a> knows how to use LLM,‚Äù that‚Äôs a good phrase.</p>
<p>This chat itself will also be used as an example.</p>
<p>I think a proper start for a book would be a short preface that can be read by someone without context first, followed by a brief introduction and examples of actual cases.</p>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/claude/icon" alt="claude.icon" height="19.5"/>Thank you very much. We are glad that you can use this chat itself as an example, and we hope that new ideas and insights will emerge as you continue your dialogue with LLM.</p>
<p>As you suggest, it is important to place a preface that is easy to get into for readers without context, rather than suddenly starting with a real example. In the preface, it might be a good idea to briefly state the purpose of this book and the issues it addresses, while suggesting the possibilities of intellectual production using LLM.</p>

<p>Introduction.</p>
<p>We are in the midst of a dramatic evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs), AI that understands and generates language, and LLMs such as ChatGPT have the potential to go beyond mere conversation and writing tools to transform intellectual production itself.</p>
<p>What does LLM enable us to do? What is intellectual production supposed to be?</p>
<p>In this book, we will explore the possibilities of practically using LLM in our own intellectual production. My skills as a programmer, my curiosity as a researcher, and my sense of language as an author. I, a man of many faces, will share with you the process of exploring a new way of intellectual production through dialogue and collaboration with LLM.</p>
<p>It is not a know-how book full of examples, nor is it a theory book with a grandiose stance. Rather, it is a record of one professional‚Äôs struggle to evolve his own intellectual production by ‚Äúmastering‚Äù LLM. It should be called a trail of an experiment to reexamine the essence of intellectual production and to create a new form of it.</p>

<p>How about a preface like this, inviting the reader on a journey of how LLM can change intellectual production? From there, I envision a flow that continues with a number of concrete examples. Of course, this is just a rough image, and we would be interested to hear your thoughts on this.</p>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>I think the way you‚Äôre going in is emo, but don‚Äôt think you should connect with the author‚Äôs past actions early on to show that something unique to this author will be written.</p>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/claude/icon" alt="claude.icon" height="19.5"/>That point is aptly made. It is important for readers to understand that this book is not just an idea, but an extension of the author‚Äôs years of awareness and exploration of the issues.</p>
<p>In the preface, it would be good to mention Mr. Nishio‚Äôs past efforts and indicate that his awareness of the issues in this book inevitably stems from them. For example, I have added something like this.</p>
<p>Introduction.</p>
<p>(omitted)</p>
<p>I have long been working to improve the intellectual productivity of individuals and teams, and in my 2013 book, ‚ÄúThe Art Behind Coding,‚Äù I explored ways to increase productivity by rethinking the intellectual production of programming from the language aspect; in my 2018 book, ‚ÄúThe Intellectual Production of Engineers, I attempted to present a universal technique that is not limited to engineering, but is applicable to all forms of intellectual production.</p>
<p>As an extension of this awareness, LLMs have suddenly appeared before my eyes as an aid, and sometimes even a substitute, for human intellectual production. This should be an opportunity to rethink the nature of intellectual production itself. As someone who has focused on the workings of language in ‚ÄúThe Technology Behind Coding‚Äù and explored universal intellectual production techniques in ‚ÄúThe Engineer‚Äôs Art of Intellectual Production,‚Äù I cannot help but see the advent of LLM as the perfect opportunity to advance my own research in a big way.</p>
<p>In this book, we will explore the possibilities of practically using LLM in our own intellectual production. (Afterword.)</p>
<p>By linking this book to the author‚Äôs past works and awareness of the issues, we hope to convey to the reader that mastering LLM is not simply a matter of jumping on the bandwagon, but a serious challenge for Mr. Nishio to develop his long-standing research theme. I am sure you will be able to impress upon your readers that mastering LLM is not just a matter of taking advantage of the boom, but a serious challenge for you to develop your longstanding research theme.</p>
<p>This is just an idea, and the wording needs to be refined. However, as a direction, how about adopting this kind of approach?</p>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>I think it is good. First, I will try to clean up the ‚Äúpreface‚Äù based on this manuscript.
(Note: I meant to do it myself, but <img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/claude/icon" alt="claude.icon" height="19.5"/>Claude mistakenly thought he was instructed to do it.)</p>

<p>Introduction.</p>
<p>We are in the midst of a dramatic evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs), AI that understands and generates language, and LLMs such as ChatGPT have the potential to go beyond mere conversation and writing tools to transform intellectual production itself.</p>
<p>I have long been working to improve the intellectual productivity of individuals and teams, and in my 2013 book, ‚ÄúThe Art Behind Coding,‚Äù I explored ways to increase productivity by rethinking the intellectual production of programming from the language aspect; in my 2018 book, ‚ÄúThe Intellectual Production of Engineers, I attempted to present a universal technique that is not limited to engineering, but is applicable to all forms of intellectual production.</p>
<p>As an extension of this awareness, LLMs have suddenly appeared before my eyes as an aid, and sometimes even a substitute, for human intellectual production. This should be an opportunity to rethink the nature of intellectual production itself. As someone who has been looking at the relationship between language and intellectual production and exploring its universal techniques, I cannot help but see the advent of LLM as an excellent opportunity to advance my own research in a big way.</p>
<p>In this book, we will explore the possibilities of practically using LLM in our own intellectual production. My skills as a programmer, my curiosity as a researcher, and my sense of language as an author. I, a man of many faces, will share with you the process of exploring a new way of intellectual production through dialogue and collaboration with LLM.</p>
<p>This book is neither a book of know-how filled with examples nor a book of grandiose theories. Rather, it is a record of one professional‚Äôs struggle to evolve his own intellectual production by ‚Äúmastering‚Äù LLM, and should be called a trail of an experiment to reexamine the essence of intellectual production and create a new form of it.</p>

<p>How about this kind of preface? It touches on Mr. Nishio‚Äôs past work and briefly describes his motivation and aims for writing this book. Of course, there is still room for improvement, but please consider this as a starting point. If you have any additions or corrections to make, we would appreciate your feedback.</p>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>What do you think would be a good title for the book?</p>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/claude/icon" alt="claude.icon" height="19.5"/>The title of the book should be catchy enough to catch the reader‚Äôs interest while expressing the content in a straightforward manner. Since the book will be about exploring a new way of intellectual production using LLM, we have a few suggestions based on that.</p>
<ul>
<li>Conversations with LLM: Evolving Intellectual Production.
<ul>
<li>While simple, the title conveys the concept of intellectual production evolving through interaction with LLM.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Intellectual Production 2.0: The New Era Pioneered by LLM
<ul>
<li>The phrase ‚ÄúIntellectual Production 2.0‚Äù describes a new phase of intellectual production with LLM.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Art of Intellectual Production with LLM.‚Äù
<ul>
<li>While reminiscent of Mr. Nishio‚Äôs previous work, ‚ÄúThe Intellectual Production Techniques of Engineers,‚Äù it also puts forth a new perspective on the use of LLM.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The New Normal of Intellectual Production: Creative Collaboration with LLM.
<ul>
<li>This title sets forth the issue that working with LLMs is becoming the ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù of intellectual production.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>An Introduction to the Use of LLM for Intellectual Producers.
<ul>
<li>The title clearly positions the program as a practical LLM application for those engaged in intellectual production.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Redesigning Intellectual Production with LLM.‚Äù
<ul>
<li>It expresses the ambitious objective of the book, which is to redesign the very nature of intellectual production with the advent of LLM.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Personally, I think that either ‚ÄúIntellectual Production Methods to Master LLM‚Äù or ‚ÄúIntellectual Production 2.0: The New Era Pioneered by LLM‚Äù would have a better impact while expressing the content in a straightforward manner. However, it is also a matter of policy whether to follow the title of the previous book or to use a completely new title.</p>
<p>These are just some ideas, and we would love to hear your thoughts as well, Nishio-sama. The title is an important element in the face of the book, so we need to examine it carefully. Let‚Äôs work together to come up with a title that sends a strong message to readers.</p>
<hr/>
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>
The commentary at the beginning is intended to be attached to the beginning of the LLM example, with the prompt, &quot;Explain what this is doing. The log of Claude 3 Opus is passed to Claude 3 Opus, which is opened in a separate tab, to generate this commentary.
<p>At first, I thought the title should be either ‚ÄúIntellectual Production Techniques for Engineers Using LLM‚Äù or ‚ÄúIntellectual Production Techniques for Engineers Using LLM‚Äù, but after seeing Claude‚Äôs proposal ‚ÄúIntellectual Production Techniques for Engineers Using LLM‚Äù, I decided to go with ‚ÄúIntellectual Production Techniques for Engineers Using LLM‚Äù. I chose ‚ÄúThe Intellectual Production Methods of Engineers Who Master LLM‚Äù because I am an ‚Äúengineer who masters LLM‚Äù and I wanted to update ‚ÄúThe Intellectual Production Methods of Engineers Who Master LLM‚Äù to ‚ÄúThe Intellectual Production Methods of Engineers Who Master LLM.</p>
