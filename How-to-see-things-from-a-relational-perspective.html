In the United States, public opinion is split down the middle on the issue of abortion. When pro- and anti-abortion groups debate the issue, they attack each other for what is wrong with the other‚Äôs arguments and appeal to the correctness of their own arguments. The conversation ends in a parallel line, and the relationship remains disconnected. However.</p>

There is an assumption that rythms are universal because they are seemingly logical and logical. From this universal logic, the other person‚Äôs opinion is very strange and full of contradictions, and one can only think that one‚Äôs own theory is correct. However, the other party is thinking the same thing. This is where the disconnect arises.</p>

Why did I become opposed to abortion, because of this sad event that happened to a relative? Why I am in favor of abortion, because of this sad event that happened to my sister.</p>

An experiment on ‚ÄúAsaichi‚Äù. In the experiment, several parents and their children were troubled by a child who kept running out of the road no matter how much they scolded him or her. The parents were blindfolded and told, ‚ÄúYou have to cross the street to be safe. The children were blindfolded by their parents and told by the staff, ‚ÄúYou have to let them cross the road safely.

When you tell a child to do something ahead of time, the child loses motivation, saying, ‚ÄúI was going to do it this way. If the child is told ahead of time to do something, he or she will think that he or she did it because he or she was ordered to do so. That is the way it should be.</p>
