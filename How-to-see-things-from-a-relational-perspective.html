In the United States, public opinion is split down the middle on the issue of abortion. When pro- and anti-abortion groups debate the issue, they attack each other for what is wrong with the other’s arguments and appeal to the correctness of their own arguments. The conversation ends in a parallel line, and the relationship remains disconnected. However.</p>

There is an assumption that rythms are universal because they are seemingly logical and logical. From this universal logic, the other person’s opinion is very strange and full of contradictions, and one can only think that one’s own theory is correct. However, the other party is thinking the same thing. This is where the disconnect arises.</p>

But personal experiences, which are generally considered to be very individual and specific cases and not universal, strike a chord beyond differences in position and claims. Why did I become opposed to abortion, because of this sad event that happened to a relative? Why I am in favor of abortion, because of this sad event that happened to my sister.</p>

An experiment on “Asaichi”. In the experiment, several parents and their children were troubled by a child who kept running out of the road no matter how much they scolded him or her. The parents were blindfolded and told, “You have to cross the street to be safe. The children were blindfolded by their parents and told by the staff, “You have to let them cross the road safely.

Even though they were sure it was safe to do so, they still carefully pulled their parents’ hands and crossed the pedestrian crossing. Every single child. All the parents were surprised. They had always jumped out without looking left or right, no matter how many times I had told them to do so!</p>

Until then, children were probably “outsourcing” their safety checks to their parents, thinking that their parents must be checking both sides of the street, and were moving according to their own interests. Parents also did not trust their children’s attentiveness and called out to them ahead of time, which led to an even greater state of outsourcing.</p>

The child must have been well aware of his or her responsibility to “take care of my parents’ lives,” and tried to cross the road safely by checking both sides of the road to the best of his or her ability. The child’s behavior changed dramatically as a result of the change in the relationship between the parents and the child.</p>

When you tell a child to do something ahead of time, the child loses motivation, saying, “I was going to do it this way. If the child is told ahead of time to do something, he or she will think that he or she did it because he or she was ordered to do so. That is the way it should be.</p>

The child realizes that the “relationship” is “you cleaned up, you did your homework because of me who gave you instructions, and you are the lazy one who didn’t move unless I gave you instructions” and becomes completely fed up with it. But.</p>
