<p>The Intellectual Production of Engineers, 3rd ed. p. 27
Suppose you can copy, say, 5 pages in 25 minutes. If the textbook is 300 pages,
It takes roughly 25 hours <a href="./copying-of-a-sutra" class="internal alias" data-slug="copying-of-a-sutra">copying of a sutra</a> to finish copying the entire sutra. If you are not familiar with sutra copying, this is a good place to start.
You may flinch at the 25-hour estimate of It is ‚Äú25 hours spent
You have to spend 25 hours.
It does not mean that you have to. sutra until you can ride a bicycle.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="./training-wheels" class="internal alias" data-slug="training-wheels">training wheels</a>. The state in which you read a book and have no idea what you‚Äôre doing is like a bicycle
It is the same as when you are on a bicycle and you keep falling over and cannot move forward. Auxiliary wheels
And then, you will be able to move forward with the And you are running with auxiliary wheels.
In the years that followed, his bicycle riding skills improved and he was able to ride without auxiliary rings.
Yes.
Even in the worst case scenario, where you can‚Äôt learn effectively, you can still do 25 hours of sutra chanting.‚Äù
The fact that it is possible to estimate that ‚Äúif you have copied one textbook, you have copied one textbook‚Äù.
I was vaguely thinking, ‚ÄúI have no idea what I‚Äôm reading, but I have to do my best to learn it.
It is easier to stay motivated than in a state of ‚ÄúI want to do this‚Äù. Clearly stated goal
This is the effect of making sure that The purpose of this is to move learning forward.
Scripture is a means, not an end. And 25 hours later is the goal.
Instead, you try it for 25 minutes first. The tutorial is a goal.
This is the effect of making the goal closer, as we learned in ‚ÄúGetting Closer‚Äù (page 10). Do.
I learned more and more efficiently, and I felt the need for sutra copying.
The ‚Äúauxiliary wheels‚Äù are no longer there. You will realize why I compared it to an auxiliary wheel.
You can remove the auxiliary wheels when you feel that you no longer need them.
I don‚Äôt know. You can stop doing the sutra when you feel that you no longer need it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once disassembled and modified</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Suppose you can copy, say, five pages in 25 minutes.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the textbook is 300 pages, it is estimated to take 25 hours to transcribe the entire book.</li>
<li>This estimate may discourage you from doing it, thinking that you have to spend 25 hours on it.</li>
<li>But that is a mistake.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shakyo is like an auxiliary wheel until you can ride a bicycle.</p>
<ul>
<li>Reading a book and not understanding it is like riding a bicycle and falling over and not moving forward.</li>
<li>So the auxiliary wheels allow them to move forward.</li>
<li>Then, as they ride with auxiliary wheels, they improve their bicycle riding skills and become able to ride without them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scripture is not the objective. The goal is for you to be able to understand the textbook.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sentence is complicated: Even in the worst case scenario where you are unable to learn effectively, you can estimate that if you continue to copy sutras for 25 hours, you will have copied a textbook, which will make it easier to stay motivated than if you vaguely think, ‚ÄúI have no idea what I am reading, but I must do my best to learn. The ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm reading, but I have to work hard to learn it.‚Äù</p>

<p>If you look vaguely at a book you read but do not understand, you will not feel that you have gained anything. On the other hand, if you do sutra copying, your writing will remain in a form. This is easier to maintain your motivation. This is the effect of having a clear goal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And it is easier to stay motivated if you set a goal for the next 25 minutes instead of 25 hours from now.</p>
<ul>
<li>It‚Äôs the effect of getting closer to the goal, as we learned in ‚ÄúTutorials Get Closer to the Goal‚Äù (page 10).</li>

<li>
<p>As you learn more and more efficiently, you will feel less and less need for sutra copying. You will realize why we compared sutra copying to an auxiliary wheel.</p>
