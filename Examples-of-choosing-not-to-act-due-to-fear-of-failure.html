<ul>
<li>In other words, “The company is not a school. If they had been told in advance that “it would be a mistake to choose ‘no action’ in this situation,” they would have acted regardless of what their mentality was.
<ul>
<li>[Demand for risk-taking depends on the line to be crossed.</li>
<li>The line we have to cross is different from when we were students, and when we act as if things will stay the same, we are told that ‘we’ll never get out of the student mindset’ or that ‘the company is not a school.‘”</li>
<li>In reality, there are multiple lines. There may be a “pass/fail line,” similar to that of a student, and a “competent/incompetent line,” which is the line that determines whether special treatment and focused investment of resources should be made in management.
<ul>
<li>The former is the decision line of “continue to invest resources or quit”. The latter is the decision line of “to concentrate resources or not to concentrate resources.</li>
