<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Metaphors are born, you see what is born, this is a metaphor.

<li>What “concept” is this “concept”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Eugene Gendlin’s concept of metaphor is one of the seven ways of working with felt sense, a creative functional relationship
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>What kind of “Eugene Gendlin” is this “Eugene Gendlin”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>A philosopher who discussed the process of experience and the creation of meaning from it
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>What kind of “creation” is this “creation”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Meaning is created anew.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>What is the “meaning” of this “meaning”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>(That’s a very abstract question.)
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Most people do not understand “making meaning” in relation to their own experience, when they are trying to put into words what they cannot say well, and they cannot express it in the common usage of the word, so they express it as a personal metaphor, This is an imagining of meaning by metaphor, or, to put it in Merleau-Ponty’s terms, an “emerging language” that has not been institutionalized.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>Is there anything else you can tell us about its “meaning”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Would it be easier to convey the meaning if I described it as taking a piece of the experience and assigning a new word to it, rather than describing it as having created meaning?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>What is it that you value?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>This discussion is a verbalization of the “process by which useful things are produced,” and if we can clarify this point, we may be able to find a way to support it. If we can support it, it will be beneficial because it will improve the intellectual productivity of humankind. Personally, I would like to let people produce intellectually without human intervention, but whether this is possible or not remains to be seen.

<li>What do you hope will happen regarding this “metaphor”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Now, I was thinking that the concept of metaphor that I had been using and the concept of metaphor that Eugene Gendlin had been using were not well connected, and I wished they could be connected.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>What needs to happen to the “metaphor” for that to happen?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>I just realized that this is the process of creating new meanings through the reaction of two felt-sense chunks, as Eugene Gendlin described in the metaphor process. So first we divide those two symbols into “yumetapha” and “nimetapha. Then we form the metaphor “Nimetapha is Umetapha”. Then a new aspect would be born.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>Can you do that with regard to “metaphor”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Let’s try it.

<li>Where does this “metaphor” come from?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Nimetapha comes from a sea of unspoken experiences, and Umetapha is not told where it comes from.

<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>It’s about a mass of felt sense being inscribed and mapped to a symbol.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>What kind of “felt sense” is that “felt sense”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Created by experience and floundering without being symbolized.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>What kind of “symbol” is this “symbol”?

<li>What kind of “nimetapha” is this “nimetapha”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Nimetapha has been likened to “pulling up a big fish with a hook,” that is, the process of combining small metaphorical symbols and pulling out new symbols that have not yet been revealed by the relationships between the symbols.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>What is the difference between its “nimetapha” and “metaphor”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Each hook is a you-metaphor, and each one hammered in creates a new aspect to the mass of felt sense.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>What is the difference between its “umetapha” and “metaphor”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>What is between the individual youmetaphors and metaphors in the nymetaphor… the metaphor, a giant fish, is enclosed by the aspects created in the individual youmetaphors.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>What happens to the “nimetapha” when its “metaphor”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Feedback occurs on the nimetapha, making it even stronger.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>Is there anything else you can tell us about that “nimetapha”?
