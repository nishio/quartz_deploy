&lt;&lt;

I'm going to decide on Heart Moving Center.


I thought it was dark, but it's raining. I can't carry it by bicycle.


The evacuation ladder inspector came. I had completely forgotten about it.


I load a carry-on bag with books on my bike and when I try to start it, it falls right off. How am I supposed to load it?
Read &lt;a href='http://www.komeri.com/howto/html/00320.html'>Comelli.comÔΩúHowTo Information: How to tie a rope to load a bicycle&lt;/a>. This kind of knot is impossible to tie with a 2-meter elastic rope bought at a 100-yen store! I was fooled! I unearthed a 10-meter rope from a junk box, so I'm going to try again with it!


I ran 10 meters and dropped it in the middle of an intersection and got into a lot of trouble.


It takes time for gas service to be opened, so you need to contact them as soon as possible. Most real estate agents will provide you with contact information for gas, electricity, and water. You will be asked for your address, name, telephone number, the date of the meeting, and the gas appliances to be connected. Tokyo Gas can also shut off the gas together with the service. If there is no change in the name, I was told that I can continue to pay by credit card, so I did so.


Waterworks. Open tomorrow, no need to be present. If water does not come out, open the main valve. I decided to have a credit card debit. I was told that I can continue the current direct debit until the application for the credit card is completed, so I decided to do so.


Buy a bookshelf? http://www.interiinu.net/?pid=6295092 I didn't like wasting space (in front of books or on top of bookshelves) so this would be good.

-- We are busy on the phone right now.
- ‚ñ° Refrigerator must be emptied and turned off about 3 days in advance
-- Eating habits that consume what's in the fridge for the time being
- The new house will be cold for a long time if the electricity is not opened.

-- ‚ñ° Find out where to contact and what to contact
-- ‚ñ° Carry halogen heaters for now?
--- ‚ñ† ‚ñ† ‚ÜêLooking for rubber straps to secure the luggage on the bicycle
--- I don't think there is any advantage to carrying stuff by bicycle on my own, like stuff that is already in containers. Since the movers will eventually carry it anyway. So it might be a good idea to start with transporting unpacked items, etc. in bags or bags.
- Is it quicker to disassemble the luminous (shelf) and transport it myself? There are long poles, is it possible to carry it by bike? If I can fix it, can I push it and walk it so it's not too far?
- I was thinking about cleaning up afterwards, but then I realized I only have 5 days left, so I guess I'll have to move what I can carry to the new house to make room for the work.
-- The shelves are a key part of the arrangement, so maybe we should just get on with it and haul them away.
-- ‚Üê Create workspace for disassembling shelves (clear out to mid-room)

- ‚ñ° Setting up mail forwarding
- ‚ñ° Change of residence certificate, change of address for driver's license
- I'm going to use &quot;howm on Dropbox&quot; because I don't want to write these work notes offline.
- ‚ñ° Wash the contents of the washing machine before moving
- ‚ñ° The notebook is full of old addresses and other information, so I will update the digital data in the near future, print it out and replace it.

**1235337372*[topcoder] Testing for power modulus
I told id:suztomo that I should make a factorial to take the remainder and prepare it for TopCoder or something like that, because &quot;the value will be huge, so take the remainder in N and answer&quot;. prefield.com/algorithm/math/powmod.html'>Spaghetti Source - should factorial&lt;/a>

So, I was just reading this and I was wondering if it is safe to be powMod(x, 2)'d when x * x exceeds the Int limit.


So I gave it a try.
>|cpp|
int main(){
  Int x = 1 &lt;&lt; 30;
  DP(x);
  DP(x * x);
  DP(powMod(x, 2, 10));
  DP(((x % 10) * (x % 10)) % 10);
}
||&lt;

result
>||
x: 1073741824
x * x: 0
powMod(x, 2, 10): 0
((x % 10) * (x % 10)) % 10: 6
||&lt;

Yes, it is. I'm getting 0 even though the correct value is 6.

&lt;hr>

Subsequent Flow
-1: Think about implementing it yourself
-2: Since it is called over and over again, I think it would be better to cache the calculation results.
-3: If we make and have the result when x=1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ... Think O(log(N)) even if you make and keep the result ahead of time when
-4: Thinking that we should just calculate once and keep it in the global area.
-5: I suddenly realized that I had never checked to see if it was OK, so I put the code through a system test in TopCoder with a counter in the global area and a fail on the 10th test.
-6: By golly, it doesn't fail! The strategy of caching in the global area and using it across test cases is not working!
-7: Then you have to calculate at compile time.
-8: I thought about it for a while and it didn't work so I decided to ask an expert (@earth2001y) and write an explanation of what I wanted to do on Twitter
-9: Before sending the message, I realize &quot;No, if M is fixed, there's no need to even compute it over there at compile time in the first place.
-10: I realize I was mistaken (&quot;if x is fixed&quot; is wrong)
-11: But at least it doesn't hurt to have a prime number table.

*1235338860*java-ja 5 reasons why people don't come to hot springs
- It's hard to convey to people who don't know Python Onsen that it's a development camp with 24-hour hot springs &amp; 24-hour meeting rooms.
- Although 13 people have already signed up and the event can be held with only 2 more participants, the explanation page, which can be viewed by anyone, has not been updated with the number of participants remaining at 6, giving off an aura that the plan is about to be abandoned.
- I think it would be better to post a link to an article about the Python spa that has been held several times at the same place to get a better sense of the atmosphere of the place where it was held. I can't find a good article at the moment, but &lt;a href='http://d.hatena.ne.jp/Voluntas/20081026/1225024120'>The 4th Python Hot Springs (summary) - Twisted Mind&lt;/a>.
- I'm participating in the Python Hot Springs with the analogy from the Python Hot Springs, thinking that &quot;of course there should be no Java-only restrictions or mandatory presentations,&quot; but did I read that anywhere... At the last Python Hot Springs, I wrote the most limited version in Haskell, but at this one, I'm going to play around with the Google App Engine. At the Java-ja spa, I'm planning to play with Google App Engine.
- The qualifications for participation are expressed in a very id:Yoshiori way.

&lt;a href='http://java-ja.yoshiori.org/index.php?%E7%AC%AC%E5%8D%81%E4%B8%89%E5%9B%9E'>13th - java-ja beta (fall)&lt;/a>

*1235354200*re: common for people on Twitter.
http://anond.hatelabo.jp/20090223041757

I have 9105 followers on Twitter and explain what I can observe from my timeline.

-1: 97% of people on Twitter speak Japanese.
-2: Four out of five people on Twitter are programmers.
-3: There are more Pythonistas than Rubyists among Twitter users.

Unless you are randomly selecting users to follow, the claim that &quot;Twitter users are like this&quot; is just saying &quot;I am surrounded by people like this&quot;. And since people usually gather with others with similar attributes (like attracts like), it is almost like saying &quot;my attributes are like this&quot;. I don't know if he is aware of it or not. There's also the word &quot;kin hatred&quot;.

*1235361775*howm on ZumoDrive
2009-04-14 Postscript: Because file disappearance occurred twice, I stopped using ZumoDrive and used DropBox. It was not a catastrophe because the history was kept, but it was a hassle to restore the files from the history every time.
&lt;hr>

I'd like to run howm (one person's easy wiki) on top of 1GB free ZumoDrive,
- You can write things in your own personal wiki offline and manage tasks and projects with a high degree of freedom,
- In addition, when it goes online, it is automatically encrypted and stored on Amazon S3, so it can be shared with your other machines,
- It's a backup that won't be lost if your machine crashes or even if your entire house burns down in a fire.
So I thought it would be a great place to store notes of ideas, so I'm going to give it a try.

-1: Go to the ZumoDrive site and Sign up http://zumodrive.com/
-2: Go to howm's site and download the latest version http://howm.sourceforge.jp/index-j.html
-3: Extract the latest version you downloaded and . /configure and sudo make install
-4: Add to ~/.emacs.el
>|lisp|
(setq howm-menu-lang 'ja)
(require 'howm)
||&lt;
-5: C-x C-e behind both expressions and let them evaluate
-6: C-c , , try. The menu appeared. I'm happy and satisfied.
-7: Install ZumoDrive
-8: Move howm's data storage area onto ZumoDrive. For those of you who are new to my blog, my OS is MacBook, and I heard that ZumoDrive also works on Windows, but I haven't tried it.
>||
$ mv ~/howm /Volumes/ZumoDrive/Documents/
||&lt;
-9: I guess you can change the data storage location in howm settings, but I think it's more convenient to have it in ~/howm, so symbolic link
>||
$ ln -s /Volumes/ZumoDrive/Documents/howm/ howm
||&lt;
-10: C-c , , in emacs again. The menu opens properly.
-11: I created a new file in howm and saved it and /Volumes/ZumoDrive/Documents/howm/2009/02/2009-02-23-122113.howm was generated. This should be OK. I will use it for a while.

PS: I set &quot;Document is always cache&quot; in the settings. This should ensure that the files will always remain locally.

*1235369658*Grammar quiz (answers)
If you have not yet seen the problem section, please see &lt;a href='http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nishiohirokazu/20090219/1235039106'>The Garbled Quiz (Problem Section)&lt;/a> first.



-Q1 (Elementary): For some reason, difficult kanji characters such as &quot;Á∏∫Ëñô&quot; were displayed when it should have said &quot;Hello, world. What happened?
-A1: That's what happens when you decode a byte sequence encoded in UTF-8 thinking it is Shift_JIS. A common case we often see is when a web page saved in UTF-8 is opened in a browser and the automatic determination fails; a famous UTF-8 site is &lt;a href='http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%A1%E3%82%A4%E3 In Firefox, go to the menu and select &quot;View&quot; -> &quot;Character Encoding&quot; -> &quot;Japanese (Shift_JIS)&quot; -> &quot;Encoding&quot; -> &quot;Japanese (Shift_JIS)&quot;. Japanese (Shift_JIS)&quot;.


Here is the code to reproduce this garbled text in Python:.
>||
>>> print u &quot;Hello&quot;.encode(&quot;utf-8&quot;).decode(&quot;sjis&quot;)
The Tinamo is a very popular place to live and work.
||&lt;


Scoring criteria: UTF-8 (10 points), Shift_JIS (10 points) for a total of 20 points. utf8, sjis, cp932, etc. are also acceptable.


-Q2(beginner level): Why did I see &quot;&amp;#227;&quot; (~ over a) etc. when it was supposed to say &quot;Hello, world. What happened.
-A2: If you decode a sequence of bytes encoded in UTF-8 as latin-1 (ISO-8859-1), you will get this. In the same way, if you open Wikipedia and select &quot;Western Europe (ISO-8859-1)&quot;, you can experience it.


Here is the code to reproduce this garbled text in Python:.
>||
>>> print u &quot;Hello&quot;.encode(&quot;utf-8&quot;).decode(&quot;latin-1&quot;)
(In Hatena Diary, it is replaced by „Äì, so it is omitted.)
||&lt;


Scoring criteria: UTF-8 (10 points), ISO-8859-1 (10 points), total 20 points. latin1 or other notation is also acceptable.


It is not interesting to talk only about garbled characters in browsers, so I omitted them, but it is also common to see garbled half-width kana characters. This is a phenomenon that occurs when a text encoded in EUC-JP is decoded in Shift_JIS. Hatena is EUC, so if you display it in Shift_JIS, you will experience the broken form with full of half-size kana characters.


-Q3 (Intermediate): I clicked on a certain link in my browser and a mysterious string of text beginning with &quot;mortar NG&quot; appeared. What happened.
-A3: This is what happens when you open a PNG format image file in Shift_JIS. The mortar NG is a string of the first 4 bytes of the PNG header decoded in Shift_JIS. The server is configured incorrectly and the Content-type header is not set to the proper value, but since this is a server-side problem, the only thing the user can do is, for example, save the file to a file and open it after changing the file extension to png.


Scoring Criteria: PNG (10 points), Description to the effect that &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;>the server side&lt;/span>(5 points) does not properly return &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;>the file type&lt;/span>(5 points) . Total 20 points.


-Q4(Advanced): For some reason &quot;S?kao&quot; was displayed when it should have said &quot;Hello&quot;. What happened?
-A4: This happens when &quot;hello&quot; is represented as a 16-bit UCS-2 string, but the function that receives it expects the string to be passed as an 8-bit byte string and uses only the last 8 of the 16 bits and discards the rest. I first saw this in Jython 2.1 when I passed a Python Unicode string to Swing's JFrame constructor. I also seem to see it occasionally when using software or web services made outside of the multibyte sphere.


The Python code to reproduce this phenomenon is: .
>|python|
>>> print &quot;&quot;.join(chr(ord(c) % 256) for c in u &quot;Hello&quot;)
S?kao
||&lt;


Scoring criteria: UCS-2 or 16-bit (10 points), and a statement to the effect that the upper byte is lost (10 points), for a total of 20 points.


-Q5 (Advanced): For some reason, a question mark surrounded by diagonal squares, etc., appeared when it should have displayed &quot;File not found&quot;. What happened? For reference, the string displayed was 20 characters, and the encoding of the displayed web page was utf8. (PS: If I add the information that up to the 6th character is ? I don't mean to ask you to go that far, but...)
-A5: When decoding a sequence of bytes into a Unicode string, Python defaults to strict mode, which throws an exception (UnicodeDecodeError) if a character not in the conversion table appears, but other language environments may default to ignore it and continue (ignore) or replace it with an appropriate character (replace). In other language environments, the default mode may be ignore and continue (ignore) or replace (replace) with an appropriate character. The &quot;question mark enclosed in a diagonal square&quot; in the question text is the Unicode REPLACEMENT CHARACTER (U+FFFD), and in many cases this character is used as the target to be replaced when in replace mode. See &lt;a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replacement_character'>Unicode Specials - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia&lt;/a>. This character becomes 3 bytes when encoded in UTF-8, so for example, if the first or second byte is out of range, the number of bytes or characters in the output will not be an integer multiple of the number of bytes or characters in the input.

I have seen this phenomenon in situations where a Java program executes a command on another machine and sends the results over the network to be tabulated and displayed on another machine, and the results (8-bit strings) returned by the shell are sent as is to the other machine. If the receiver and the sender have the same default encoding, it will not be detected, but if the sender sends the message in SJIS on Windows and the receiver interprets it as UTF-8 on Linux, the message will be corrupted. I wrote this based on my memory, but when I unearthed the e-mail from that time, I found the following
>||
Ko (82 B1)
‚Üì
E3 83 BB EF BD BD
E3 83 BB EF BD BD

Table (95 5C)
‚Üì
E3 83 BB EF BD BD
5C
||&lt;
What it says, so it's totally different from the question. Oh, no. No wonder the difficulty level seems lower than I remember at that time....


Now here is the Python code to reproduce this phenomenon:.
>|python|
>>> import codecs
>>> codecs.lookup(&quot;utf-8&quot;).decode(u &quot;File not found&quot;.encode(&quot;sjis&quot;), errors=&quot;replace&quot;)
(u'\ufffdt\ufffd@\ufffdC\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\x82\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd', 24)
||&lt;


Scoring criteria: 20 points for mention of replace mode (10 points), REPLACEMENT CHARACTER or U+FFFD (5 points), and noting that shell output encoding is environment-dependent (5 points). 10 bonus points for mention of Windows or SJIS.
Additional points: for each question except #3, 10 points per language for each code that reproduces the phenomenon in the question text.


I hope you enjoyed this explanation and rough scoring criteria. I am not very good at talking about character codes, so if there are any mistakes or inaccuracies, please let me know.
