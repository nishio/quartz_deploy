*1194954118* Housework is brain training.
In the book &quot;Leverage Thinking,&quot; a quotation from the book &quot;15 Habits for a Brighter Brain&quot; is quoted as saying, &quot;Doing a few tedious things every day, such as cleaning up your room, will strengthen your frontal lobe's ability to issue commands.&quot; I saw this quote and thought to myself, &quot;Well, I often say that I lack the ability to continue or make a habit, but it's like saying that I lack basic physical fitness and cannot complete a full marathon. I thought to myself, &quot;I should start by running even a few marathons before trying and failing to run a marathon.

So today I woke up in the morning and started cleaning up my room in the little free time I had. For starters, I collected the PET bottles scattered around the room and washed them. It's a tedious and unproductive task, but it doesn't matter if I think of it as a muscle workout. I thought to myself, &quot;Just as abs exercise does not seem to produce anything, but it strengthens my muscles, this work, which seems to produce nothing, is actually training my brain.

Then my brain became active, and to my surprise, I remembered that today was the day for burnable trash, and was able to pick up all the trash in the room and put it out in bags.

After you put it out, you find another piece of trash on your desk or something.

If it had been before, I would have said, &quot;Oh, I wasted a garbage bag. I could have put it in another bag. But now I can take out another bag and put it in it without hesitation. The purpose is not to save the bag or clean the room, but to train my brain, so if it's there, I just put it away. I just proceed nonchalantly.

The goal was not to clean the room, so it didn't get cleaned up, but it doesn't matter. In the first place, there is no way to clean up the room in a few hours in the morning, and the task of throwing out the trash was worth it in itself.

But seeing the clean plastic bottles and taking out the trash gives me a sense of accomplishment, so it doesn't seem so bad.

*1194954172* Going home
While setting rice and water in the rice cooker to cook, I collected plastic bottles from around the room. There were still many under the bed. Then I washed them and put them out. Tomorrow is the day for recyclable garbage.

*1194954349*Health Assessment
Today was a physical examination.

My eyesight was much worse and I had a lot of trouble seeing.

I'm trying to distinguish the smallest circle slit. Currently 1.5 in both eyes. how long can I keep it up?

*1194954708* Programmers and housekeeping
From a programmer's point of view, it is the right thing to do to stash the trash until the trash bag is full and then take it out. Perhaps we need to put aside our programmatic ideas for a moment in order to gain the continuity to keep doing the tedious details every day.

Of course, &quot;laziness&quot; is one of the three virtues of a programmer, but if you can also be &quot;diligent&quot; when necessary, that's better.

I think the machine language is that... Hienishant (ancient magical language, originally from BASTARD! The original is BASTARD! You have to make a contract with an ancient god (CPU) to chant spells :)
&lt;&lt;

I see.
Today, only high-ranking magicians and dragons use that term. Like.

The &lt;a href=&quot;http://d.hatena.ne.jp/keyword/%A5%C9%A5%E9%A5%B4%A5%F3%A5%D6%A5%C3%A5%AF&quot;>Dragon Book&lt;/a> is a how to make a magical device that converts words that are easy for people to understand into ancient magical language that is easy for dragons to understand The book is a book of And.

*1194967380*Logged in with cell phone
Even just typing a password is a pain in the ass, but it's super annoying because the browser doesn't remember it or keep you logged in with a cookie. I am sure that many of the services used on cell phones must have easy-to-understand passwords. Isn't there some kind of single sign-on for mobile services?
