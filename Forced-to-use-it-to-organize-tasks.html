task, so I tried a crazy experiment: if that’s the case, why not open a chat for each task?
→Conclusion: Objective achieved</p>
<p>consideration</p>
<ul>
<li>Open a separate chat for each task and you can drill down individually.
<ul>
<li>That’s not the way it was done in the Mattermost era.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Crystallization of the previous task to a question of value will have a positive impact on the later task.
<ul>
<li>The language in the #2 chat about the importance of the rate of keyword increase gave a strong raison d’être to task #5.</li>
<li>Before I started, I thought maybe number 4 would be next.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The more detailed the individual tasks, the easier it was for humans to prioritize, and the zero chat was in phase mode and not asking questions.
<ul>
<li>It would have been hard to do a recap on each of the five tasks if we had had questions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>How to end this dialogue? First idea, “What just happened?” with the appearance of “I see” and verbalization of the content of the awareness, then “Is this a good place to end?” and if “Yes”, then end; second idea, “What happened?” or “Is this a good place to end?” with machine learning.

It’s exhausting on the human side, and the quality of the questions generally declines as you run out of good keywords, leading to an unpleasant ending.

<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Another thing that came to mind during the first chat, looking at the extracted keywords for each step in the early stages, there may be a difference between cases that develop well and those that do not. We could use that to detect situations that don’t seem to work and give advice on how to make them better.

<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>I think the probability of prompting awareness depends on the question.

<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>In the early stages of this dialogue, some people don’t get on track well and crash, and I want to help them get on track well.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>Is there anything else you can tell us about that early stage?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>The chat system asks in-depth questions in response to keywords, but in extreme cases, for example, there are people who enter sentences with no keywords at all. In such cases, of course, there are no keywords, so it is impossible to ask a proper question.

<li>Where is this early stage?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Especially the first time you use it, I recommend looking at the log, but you start it up without looking at it and put “what do you want to happen?” and then you start up without looking at the log and put “Nothing” in the “What do you want to happen? Well, aside from such extreme cases, even people who have read the logs to some extent sometimes use NGKW too much and run out of keywords.

<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>As for how to know that the early stages are not going well, perhaps you can compare the logs that are going well with those that are not and see if there is a significant difference in the growth of the number of keywords extracted, and then you can determine that.

<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>It’s already there, but it’s like launching a rocket, you have to get a certain speed or you’ll crash.

<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What type of keyword extraction is that?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>It is rather good for some long sentences, but for short words, it tries to force extraction from them and sometimes extracts strange things. The goodness of the keywords found is normalized to a maximum of 100 points, so if the input is such that only one garbage keyword is found, it will be a garbage keyword with 100 points.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What is it that you value?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>It is important to be able to extract good keywords
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>Where do these keywords come from?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Should we just lower the score when the user’s input is short or something? Not necessarily, I guess…sometimes you have to put in a perfect keyword in one word. I still have to machine learn how good the keywords are.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What should those keywords happen to be?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Bad keywords, even if they are extracted, should score low.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What needs to happen to those keywords for that to happen?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>We just need to determine that the keyword is bad.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>Can that keyword do it?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>You can do that by putting together that kind of machine learning.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What type of machine learning is that?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>We can use a binary classification to learn whether NG or not, and use the probability values as coefficients.

<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>When we say keyword extraction, the world often extracts noun phrases. It’s the same with keywords in papers and so on. But when I think about using them in this chat, verbs are often accompanied by more concrete images than nouns, and are too good to throw away.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What type of noun is it?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>If you extract the noun, it would look like this. With verbs, it would be “What kind of ‘use’ is that ‘use’?” And so on. It’s a question, isn’t it?

<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Second is the design of the early stage, which is to “have many users experience that by using this chat system, they can get language and awareness of their blind spots,” and to solve the problem of not getting off track in the early stage for this purpose.

<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>He wrote that he can detect the slow rate of keyword increase, but does not know what to do about it. Is it better to visualize it? A rocket launch metaphor, a percentage indication of how far the value to be achieved in each phase has been achieved?

<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>The third is the ability to play bad keywords. The value is to be able to extract good keywords. This is machine learning of good and bad keywords.

<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>The fourth is the naturalness determination of the question, which has not yet reached the value question. Specifically, I am thinking that I should devise a feature to do this in a rule-based manner.

<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>The fifth is motion extraction, which is also not a value question. It is easy enough to just extract verbs, but not everything, so a filter must be applied.

<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>And well, after thinking this far, I decided that the first of the five should be movement extraction. Because it will have a positive impact on the way the early stages of the project will proceed by increasing the number of keywords extracted. Next is a mechanism to play the keywords that are not good. This improves the quality of keywords and reduces the likelihood of stumbling in the early stages.

<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>The early design does not have a clear language of action. It would be a good idea to try to verbalize it again after the first two are done. And if you come up with one, implement it, and if not, proceed to the end design.

<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Improvements to the naturalness determination of the questions are pending, but I’m okay with putting it off until later because the training data is growing just by leaving it alone.

<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>I wanted the tasks to be organized, but I got what I needed to do first and next, so the objective was achieved.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>Is there anything else about that task?</p>
