I think it would be beneficial for the world to publish this experience in writing, so I will gradually organize it in the future.
Nishio knows too much detail to explain it succinctly yet. For now, I’m going to write down everything I remember and think of, and then I’ll try to sort it out.</p>

<p>What is <a href="./Boost-Conference" class="internal alias" data-slug="Boost-Conference">Boost Conference</a>?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In human resource development projects where multiple projects are adopted at the same time and the project implementation period lasts several months before the results are reported, a meeting is held at the beginning of the project where the adopters make a presentation on the contents of the project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>See <a href="./Boost-Conference" class="internal alias" data-slug="Boost-Conference">Boost Conference</a> for more information.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What we did this year</p>
<ul>
<li>In a nutshell, “asynchronize self-introductions and presentations.”</li>
<li>Participants first create a self-introduction page.</li>
<li>Boost meeting 1 week prior to the meeting.
<ul>
<li>Each creator shoots a 10-15 minute presentation video</li>
<li>Uploaded to YouTube as Unlisted</li>
<li>Paste into Scrapbox</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Participants must be present on or before the day of the event.
<ul>
<li>Watch the video</li>
<li>Leave questions and comments using Scrapbox’s Tree Board-like usage.

</li>
</ul>
<p>Conversation at a presentation</p>
<ul>
<li>(While listening to a 1x presentation synchronously)</li>
<li>A: It’s frustrating that I’m so used to being able to look back at what I want to look back at that I can’t look back at what I was saying.</li>
<li>B: Yes, I wouldn’t miss it for a second!</li>
<li>A: A presentation that is supposed to be able to be looked back on is going to change the structure of the presentation in the first place.</li>
<li>C: The year before last, we shared slides in advance</li>
<li>D: I don’t think Mr. C shared the context of Mr. A’s talk. The Unexplored Junior’s Boost conference was in a format where you could watch the presentation videos in advance. In other words, you could watch it at 1.5x speed or something and rewatch the parts you were interested in, and then just do the Q&amp;A on the day of the conference.</li>
<li>B: &amp; write questions in Scrapbox in advance style</li>
<li>E: It looks like a flipped class.</li>
<li>F:. Flipped class + Scrapbox.</li>
<li>G: Video is good because you don’t have to be nervous and make mistakes in your presentation on the day of the event!</li>
<li>H: I think this is a big factor. I don’t think there are any more cases where people stay up all night the day before to prepare presentation materials, and then on the day of the presentation, they are in such a hurry that they can’t think straight and the Q&amp;A session is a bit awkward. Asynchronous presentations also reduce the amount of time lost.</li>
<li>F: The disadvantage is that it is difficult to follow the discussion and Q&amp;A conversations without watching the videos</li>
<li>G: Seems difficult to get people to watch the video in advance</li>
<li>B: I can use the advance viewing more time-efficiently, because I can play it back at double speed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Explanation of a certain place</p>
<ul>
<li>Presenters will post videos on Scrapbox in advance, participants will watch them in advance and write questions and comments in Scrapbox, and on the day of the event, only synchronous things like questions and live demos will be done.</li>
<li>The fact that the presentation is on video allows participants to watch it at any time, play it back at double speed, and listen back to parts they didn’t understand well.</li>
<li>Reduced the amount of time participants were held up, while allowing more time for questions.
<ul>
<li>In addition, by having the questions gathered in advance in text format, there was no more “waiting for someone to show up to ask a question” and the Q&amp;A time was used more efficiently.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Q: Don’t you know who wrote it?
<ul>
<li>A: Create a profile page and icon notation</li>
<li>Q: Good-sex operation?</li>
<li>A: It was pointed out early on that “you could fabricate statements,” and that’s what we’re working on 5/18.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Some of the active creatives seemed to be having a blast until 7pm.</li>
</ul>
<p>Changes we knew about in advance</p>
<ul>
<li>Last year it took 8 hours and 15 minutes for 15 projects, this year 5 hours and 20 minutes for 14 projects.
<ul>
<li>I could put in a guest LT in my spare time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Changes observed after the fact</p>
<ul>
<li>Asynchronous self-introductions were unexpectedly exciting.
- <a href="./Wiki-is-a-good-place-to-introduce-yourself." class="internal alias" data-slug="Wiki-is-a-good-place-to-introduce-yourself.">Wiki is a good place to introduce yourself.</a>
<ul>
<li>It is unlikely to develop with comments on self-introductions, either in chat or voice.
<ul>
<li>If you are physically assembled, this will occur during the break time chit-chat after introductions, etc.</li>
<li>Individual differences are great.</li>
<li>Holding the event online made it harder to do.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Asynchronous text-based question comments were more crowded than expected.
<ul>
<li>At first I was worried that I wouldn’t get any comments at all, but when I opened the lid, I got more comments than I could fit on a single page by the day before.</li>
<li>During the Q&amp;A portion of the day, participants added their thoughts and comments as they listened to the responses, and in the end, each project received about 10,000 words of feedback.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Scrapbox exceeded 600 pages at the end of the Boost conference.</li>
</ul>
<p>Personal Concerns
- <a href="./Tool-Culture-Issues" class="internal alias" data-slug="Tool-Culture-Issues">Tool Culture Issues</a></p>
<ul>
<li>I wonder if only the easy-to-understand “I used Scrapbox” and “I let the video come out first” stories will be heard by one person.
<ul>
<li>If you only introduce tools and imitate methods as if that were a silver bullet, it won’t work.</li>
<li>Especially the second half of [Wiki is a good place to introduce yourself.
<ul>
<li>100% of this year’s adopters created profile pages, and conversations occurred on the profile pages, which helped with mutual understanding.</li>
<li>23 out of 46 guests did not do the “first thing to do” profile page creation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I’m not sure we can reach critical mass without a certain amount of people with a high “sense of ownership.”</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>As of 4/26, Mr. Ukai consulted with the mentors on the policy of “recording and uploading the video in advance, and only conducting Q&amp;A and exchanges”.</p>
<ul>
<li>Last year was the first online event due to COVID19, so we did the same 15-minute presentation and 10-minute Q&amp;A as the offline event.
<ul>
<li>But it was too much of a burden to do two full days of video viewing compared to offline viewing.</li>

<p>5/16 Cormorant drafted an announcement for adopters assuming Scrapbox will be used and asked mentors to review</p>
<ul>
<li>Scrapbox groups are created.</li>
<li>Mr. Teramoto does a lot of maintenance.

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Separated the project page and the page to put the video of the boost meeting (foreshadowing B).</li>
<li>Teramoto-san created pages for each project.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>During this process, Nishio lists the Scrapbox of his adopted projects in the past
<ul>
<li>I used it for the first time at the 2017 Unexplored Junior Camp.

<li>PRIVATE PROJECT OPERATION on the adopted project in 2017.</li>
<li>2018-2020 changed the operation to make public project with difficult to guess project name.</li>
<li>Teramoto has also been using Scrapbox since 2018 to summarize the minutes of adopted projects.
<ul>
<li>Nishio didn’t recognize it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Teramoto: “It would be interesting if various projects were linked across the board.” Nishio: “It would be good to <a href="./link" class="internal" data-slug="link">link</a> alumni to introduce themselves.”
<ul>
<li>Example: <code>I wanted to port a prototype I made in [Scratch] to [Unity], but after some consideration I decided to do it in [Web App] and created it in [Vue]. It is hosted by [Firebase Hosting] for free. We use [SkyWeb] for videoconferencing. It's like </code>.</li>
<li>They decide to take the initiative by introducing themselves first.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>At that time, I thought “Scrapbox is for asynchronous communication until the day before, and on the day of the event, I will use Mattermost, a Slack clone, because Scrapbox does not have reactions and emojis, etc., which makes it less exciting” (Foreshadowing E).</li>

<p>nishio I think it would be nice if the upperclassmen are already participating and the place is already warmed up at the stage when new students enter, just like in a normal lab operation.

<p>nishio: if we have a discussion, why don’t we stop putting it in the rules and cut it out to a separate page for discussion?</p>

<p>That would be more beneficial than descending as a rule for unknown reasons.</p>

<li>Discussion: <a href="./The-rule-against-erasing-is-too-strong." class="internal alias" data-slug="The-rule-against-erasing-is-too-strong.">The rule against erasing is too strong.</a></li>
<li>Inspired by this(?) A discussion arose from adopters as to whether or not to classify “book recommendations”
<ul>
<li>This one bothered me personally quite a bit.
<ul>
<li>One option is to “leave it to autonomy.”</li>
<li>On the other hand, “more rules” is a streak of evil.
<ul>
<li>The more rules you can’t understand at a glance, the more you’ll lose the ease of writing.</li>
<li>How to classify books is a difficult problem, no easy-to-understand rules can be created.</li>
<li>[Classification criteria made before the whole picture is known are highly likely to be wrong.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>That discussion led to the question, “Is recommended sci-fi even an option?” and I agreed because I thought it would lead to an increase in content if we made it “yes”.</li>
<li>And by the way, I made the intervention that “there’s no need to limit it to books.”</li>

<p>6/6</p>
<ul>
<li>Video upload deadline</li>
<li>Commenting on uploaded videos.</li>
<li>I felt differently about being the first to comment on my own adopted project, so I asked other mentors to do so.</li>
<li>Some videos are difficult to comment on.
<ul>
<li>The original intention was to “present to the mentor on Zoom and record it” ([Foreshadowing A <a href="https://scrapbox.io/nishio/%E6%9C%AA%E8%B8%8F%E3%82%B8%E3%83%A5%E3%83%8B%E3%82%A22021%E3%25" class="external">https://scrapbox.io/nishio/%E6%9C%AA%E8%B8%8F%E3%82%B8%E3%83%A5%E3%83%8B%E3%82%A22021%E3%<svg aria-hidden="true" class="external-icon" style="max-width:0.8em;max-height:0.8em;" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><path d="M320 0H288V64h32 82.7L201.4 265.4 178.7 288 224 333.3l22.6-22.6L448 109.3V192v32h64V192 32 0H480 320zM32 32H0V64 480v32H32 456h32V480 352 320H424v32 96H64V96h96 32V32H160 32z"></path></svg></a> 83%96%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B9%E3%83%88%E4%BC%9A%E8%AD%B0#60cbe4e8aff09e0000a1cfd7]recovered)</li>
<li>Then tools such as Loom were introduced, and it was agreed that they would look better.</li>
<li>The case where the asynchronous style of “creator takes a video of the presentation and the mentor comments on it” was not a good choice here.
<ul>
<li>Typical “large task with an unclear definition of completion.”
<ul>
<li>Deadlines are looming ever closer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the mentor sees the finished video and has a slight concern, it will be difficult to make the decision to “throw it away and take it back”.
<ul>
<li>Even if there is something that bothers them a little, they say, “It’s not worth having them reshoot it,” and it doesn’t get corrected.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The cost of a creator presenting and a mentor commenting and modifying the presentation is cheaper than the cost of modifying it after the video is taken
<ul>
<li>Or the cost should have been reduced by “making the first video messy with the intention of throwing it away,” but this was not a common understanding between the mentors and creators.</li>
<li>For example, “Should I add subtitles?” was asked by a creator. At first I didn’t understand what he meant, but there may have been a misunderstanding that we had to make YouTuber-like videos.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Maybe we should have made it synchronous, at least up to video ver. 1.
<ul>
<li>In other words, practice the presentation to the mentor, look at it and give feedback on corrections, and repeat the cycle several times before recording.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The pressure for the mentors was that there was less than a week between the final decision to adopt and the deadline for video submissions.
<ul>
<li>Would have preferred several meetings if possible.</li>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Half of the page content disappears due to an operational error.</li>
<li>I was able to restore the project’s video postings and descriptions in Page History in Scrapbox itself.

<li>However, only the one from about 30 minutes ago was saved, and dozens of lines for two people who commented after that time were lost.</li>

<ul>
<li>Scrapbox is being updated with a bang, but I think it will look “lonely” because they don’t show it there on Zoom.</li>
<li>But I have a theory that scrolling with Zoom screen sharing will make people who were gazing at the screen trying to read the text get drunk.

<li>I want to share the screen from my own hand, and it’s too much work to give verbal instructions every time I want someone to scroll.”</li>

<li>It’s hard to read long sentences flowing slowly on the comment screen.
<ul>
<li>Not good for long sentences.</li>
<li>Demonstrations and reactions like “Oh wow” and “Wow!

<li>In the first place, “Oh!” and “Wow!” don’t occur very often during questioning.</li>

<li>If a user “posts as a question” will it stay on the screen?</li>

<li>I think it worked in the right direction that the mentors of Unexplored Junior basically did not align themselves with those around them, but rather did things the way they thought best (using comment screens, or not).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Opinion at about 2:00 p.m. on the first day: “It’s just mentors and creatives talking.”
<ul>
<li>This is an opinion that implicitly considers “that’s not good”</li>
<li>Nishio’s opinion is.
<ul>
<li>That’s not a bad thing.</li>
<li>They’ve been telling us for weeks that this was the configuration.</li>
<li>I prepare for it the day before ([Foreshadowing D Recovery <a href="https://scrapbox.io/nishio/%E6%9C%AA%E8%B8%8F%E3%82%B8%E3%83%A5%E3%83%8B%E3%82%A22021%E3%83%96%E3%83%BC%E3%25" class="external">https://scrapbox.io/nishio/%E6%9C%AA%E8%B8%8F%E3%82%B8%E3%83%A5%E3%83%8B%E3%82%A22021%E3%83%96%E3%83%BC%E3%<svg aria-hidden="true" class="external-icon" style="max-width:0.8em;max-height:0.8em;" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><path d="M320 0H288V64h32 82.7L201.4 265.4 178.7 288 224 333.3l22.6-22.6L448 109.3V192v32h64V192 32 0H480 320zM32 32H0V64 480v32H32 456h32V480 352 320H424v32 96H64V96h96 32V32H160 32z"></path></svg></a> 82%B9%E3%83%88%E4%BC%9A%E8%AD%B0#60cc2d35aff09e0000961f5a])</li>
<li>Not something to discuss on the day.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A thought I’ve had time to think about.
<ul>
<li>I consider boost meetings to be “a place for others to learn about the creators and the project,” so I implicitly choose to “maximize the amount of creators’ comments.”</li>
<li>So I’m summarizing and shortening the pre-question text.</li>
<li>Giving creators time to think in advance also gives them more time to speak.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I think it had a positive effect on the shared perception that “we don’t have to be unified.”
<ul>
<li>On the other hand, if you tell people that “this is the strongest way,” the force to unify with that “strongest way” will work, and individual exploration will be suppressed. This would be counterproductive.</li>

<li>A good theory is to only unify “upload videos first,” “discuss in Scrapbox,” etc., and leave the day’s progress to discretion.</li>
