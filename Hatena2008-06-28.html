I'm not sure if that's true. &quot;Python's multiple assignments are different from C's multiple assignments in the order in which the assignments occur.&quot; http://tinyurl.com/673zwq Is that right? But it seems like the only thing the code shows is the timing of the GC.
- http://twitter.com/smeghead/statuses/845517112
&lt;&lt;

Well, the reason why x is GC'd first is because x is assigned first and what was in x is reduced in reference count first, but maybe that was a confusing example. So here is a direct example:

>|python|
>>> class MyNamespace(dict):
...     def __setitem__(self, k, v):
...         print &quot;set&quot;, k, v
... 
>>> exec &quot;x = y = 1&quot; in MyNamespace()
set x 1
set y 1
||&lt;

In C, the assignment of x = y = 1 is interpreted as x = (y = 1) because equal is a right-associative operator, but Python's assignment statement is not so, and the syntax is designed for multiple assignments.

>||
assignment_stmt  	::=  	(target_list &quot;=&quot;)+ expression_list

It takes 4 minutes to process 5000 x 5000 cases...that's O(N*M). I should add the essence of Myers' An O(ND) Difference Algorithm and Its Variations, which I wrote yesterday, to this code.

*1214631753*Needleman-Wunsch algorithm implemented.
Someone in 86 chat was trying to make a diff before, and he was having trouble because he was allocating an N * M array for a string of length N, M, which ate too much memory for a large input size. I need to have them all because I have to go back and find the path later!&quot; No, I don't. I just have to have the root of the path by reference! If we keep only the root of the path by reference, the path we don't need will disappear in GC! I was talking about this, but now I kinda need it myself, so I made it. Yeah, it works as I thought it would.

It is written in the test case, but when executed, the input/output looks like the one below.

What I want to do is diff two very similar HTML files, but I can't get it to work using the normal line-by-line diff. I thought I could use a character-by-character diff, but that would give me very stupid results, because the y in the Library in one sentence would match the y in the body tag of the other sentence. Since we have knowledge about the structure of input &quot;being HTML,&quot; there is no way but to use it. So, I used regular expressions to separate the &lt;~~> form into tokens and the non &lt;~~> form into tokens, and diffing with those tokens worked, but not as well as I had hoped. I don't want to put too much emphasis on text node discrepancies, since they are &quot;natural&quot; input, and I want the difference between an ul tag and an a tag to be considered a big difference. I wanted to customize that part, so I put together a function to calculate the score. For now, it's still a simple comparison.

String or no string is not essential, as you can see from the code below, which feeds a string or a list of integers. But now I need random access to the file.... I'll have the contents of the file in memory. Well, the object I want to apply it to is not in the size of a gigabyte, so I guess it's OK.

*1214669168*[cpp]create shared_ptr
I glanced at &lt;a href='http://www.freia.jp/taka/blog/536'>I wrote shared_ptr for BREW with C++ template - Shimizugawa Web&lt;/a> and implemented it without reading it because it was short and I wanted to learn. I was taught a lot of things.
-----
In addition, I would like to reiterate a note in case anyone tries to use this code. I am not assuming that it will be used for practical purposes. Rather, I wrote &quot;free&quot; for &quot;delete&quot; and the code did not work.

>|cpp|
#include &lt;iostream>
using namespace std;

template&lt;typename T>
class PtrWrapper {
public:
  PtrWrapper(T* ptr):_ptr(ptr),_count(1){}
  ~PtrWrapper(){
    delete _ptr;
  }
  int dec(){
    _count--;
    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;obj &quot; &lt;&lt; *_ptr &lt;&lt; &quot; refcount &quot; &lt;&lt; _count &lt;&lt; endl;
    return _count;
  }
  void inc(){
    _count++;
    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;obj &quot; &lt;&lt; *_ptr &lt;&lt; &quot; refcount &quot; &lt;&lt; _count &lt;&lt; endl;
  }
  T* _ptr;
private:
  int _count;
};

template&lt;typename T>
class SharedPtr {
public:
  SharedPtr(T* ptr):_ptrwrap(new PtrWrapper&lt;T>(ptr)){
  }
  ~SharedPtr(){
    if(_ptrwrap->dec() == 0){
      delete _ptrwrap;
    };
  }
  T* operator->(){
    return _ptrwrap._ptr;
  }
  operator T*(){ // weird syntax here?
    return _ptrwrap._ptr;
  }
  SharedPtr&lt;T>&amp; operator=(SharedPtr&amp; rhs){ // reference return or copying will occur
    if(_ptrwrap->dec() == 0){
      delete _ptrwrap;
    };
    rhs._ptrwrap->inc();
    _ptrwrap = rhs._ptrwrap;
    return *this;
  }
  PtrWrapper&lt;T> *_ptrwrap;
};

class MyValue {
public:
  MyValue():value(42){
    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;cstr wit 42&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;
  }
  MyValue(int v):value(v){
    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;cstr with value&quot; &lt;&lt; value &lt;&lt; endl;
  }
  ~MyValue(){
    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;dstr&quot; &lt;&lt; value &lt;&lt; endl;
  }
  MyValue(const MyValue &amp;v){
    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;copy cstr &quot; &lt;&lt; value &lt;&lt; endl;
    value = v.value;
  }
  int value;
};

ostream&amp; operator&lt;&lt;(std::ostream&amp; os, const MyValue&amp; v){
  os &lt;&lt; v.value;
  return os;
}

typedef SharedPtr&lt;MyValue> SPM;

int main(){
  {
    SPM x(new MyValue(43));
    {
      SPM y(new MyValue(44));
      x = y;
      cout &lt;&lt; &quot;after assign&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;
    }
    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;out_of_y&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;
  }
  cout &lt;&lt; &quot;out_of_x&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;
}
-----
output (e.g. of dynamo)
cstr with value43
cstr with value44
obj 43 refcount 0
dstr43
obj 44 refcount 2
after assign
obj 44 refcount 1

I have been taught by &lt;body>ujm. I just confirmed with math that this is indeed the case for finding the edit distance. &lt;BR>I think I was thinking only of dp in the general case (cost depends on the node and branch), so I thought it was impossible. I think it may be necessary to do a reverse search depending on the cost function. &lt;/body> &lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;br
