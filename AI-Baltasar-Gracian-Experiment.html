<p>It is important to be aware of the power of first impressions, as they can often shape how we view a situation or person. It is also important to be aware of our own faults and to take steps to address them, as this can help us to become better people. Additionally, it is important to be aware of the power of words and to use them wisely, as they can have a lasting impact on those around us. Finally, it is important to be aware of the power of kindness and to use it to our advantage, as it can help us to build strong relationships with those around us. Additionally, it is important to be aware of the power of subtle policy and to grant favours before they are deserved, as this can be a proof of being obliging. Furthermore, it is important to never share the secrets of your superiors, as this can have serious consequences.

<p>Wisdom is the ability to think deeply and critically about difficult topics, to recognize and understand the complexities of a situation, and to make decisions based on sound judgment and experience. It is the ability to use knowledge and experience to make informed decisions and to act in a way that is beneficial to oneself and to others. Wisdom also involves understanding the consequences of one‚Äôs actions and being able to recognize when it is necessary to take a different course of action. Additionally, wisdom involves the ability to adapt oneself to one‚Äôs company, to employ no more force than is necessary, and to recognize that excellence and achievement are the only foundations for immortality.
