Friendship tokens, I had 5 extra, still overdisposed, and the mediator was playing with them after all. And I’m diluted with victory points that can’t be discarded and fail to draw off.
However, being able to destroy it with a mediator and return it to coins is good for emergency money.
In retrospect, I would have rather had a servant militia since the mediator in the early stages is a “1 discard per action” with nothing gained by discarding 0 cost copper coins. If you want to increase the discards, I think it would be better to add another cantrip servant.</li>

Town 4: Village and + purchase +2 coins choice
Barter 5: You can return an action card to your supply in a cantrip. If you do, you gain an action with a different name and cost 5 or less into your hand.
Highland Shepherd: 2 win advantages per pair of 1 friendly and 2 cost cards</p>
<p>Oh, special victory points. If there is enough friendship, the house will be worth 3 points, which is the equivalent of a public domain.
Draw: Blacksmith
Action: Town
Acquisitions: workshops, artisans, towns
Compression: chapel, mediator</p>
<p>The chapel is overdisposed of because we want to destroy it with a mediator to gain friendship. The question is whether the first move is a silver coin mediator or a workshop mediator, and there is some concern that the workshop is too active to compress, but the idea is that you can collect towns and blacksmiths. No, you have a precursor, which is a cantrip, so you don’t want to disturb it.</p>

<p>I was able to buy a mansion from the League of Bankers with 10 “servants” of the new Dominion expansion “Alliance” with a confirmed receipt of 8 coins each turn (although it was the last province to receive 8 coins).
The servants produce newly added “friendship tokens” in cantrips, so the chain of servants increases the friendship level of the banker’s federation and “receive 1/4 of the coins of the friendship tokens” each turn, and the story is about expanding the business with bank loans without cash. The enemies are bandits who aim to destroy the treasure, but there is no cash, so it is safe!</p>
