<li>Before the advent of cell phones, we used to say things like, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs meet in front of Hachiko at what time,‚Äù and then wait in front of Hachiko for about 15 minutes, frustrated because we didn‚Äôt see you coming. Now I can communicate with people at a distance even while walking around, so I can say, ‚ÄúCall me when you get there,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI got there, where are you now? Now, the interaction has changed to ‚Äúcall me when you get there‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here, where are you now?
<ul>
<li>From the point of view of people before the advent of cell phones, we are communicating with people in remote areas, so it‚Äôs a kind of telepathy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Furthermore, a form of interaction is occurring where people go further from ‚Äúwhere are you?‚Äù by making a phone call to meet up and share their location in real time via GPS.

<ul>
<li>Non-monetary values, such as social capital and trust, form the basis of transactions.</li>
<li>Value is created based on mutual cooperation and contributions between communities, which is then used in place of money for trade and exchange of services</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tokens that express quantities of value,‚Äù such as those once carried by money, can now be easily issued.
<ul>
<li>For example, contributions to the OSS can be quantified as those tokens, and those tokens can be used to incentivize others to make the contributions you want them to make.
<ul>
<li>This is the same composition as working, earning money, and then using that money to buy <a href="./made-to-order" class="internal" data-slug="made-to-order">made-to-order</a> things.</li>

<li>Collaborate without worrying about whether you are in the U.S. or Taiwan, or where you are physically located.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It‚Äôs similar to stock options in that people who find value in the tokens work for them as a reward.
<ul>
<li>Stock options are ‚Äútokens that cannot be exchanged for money‚Äù at the time of grant, and the ‚Äúexpectation‚Äù that they may have value when the stock is listed in the future creates subjective value.</li>
<li>PMP tokens can be considered a separate ownership interest in an OSS project, just as shares are a separate ownership interest in a company.
<ul>
<li>You have a vote on where the project is going, so it‚Äôs like a real-time shareholder meeting.</li>

<ul>
<li>The state is in armed control of an area and has the power to demand that the people living there ‚Äúgive us money‚Äù in this way, so taxation is done, but who has the authority to tax this activity on the Web? This is a difficult subject, so I‚Äôll leave it at that and go to the next question.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>Does the same as stock options include the implication that they may be redeemable for real money in the future?
<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>This is the important part. If the system allows conversion to Japanese yen, it will be taxable.

<li>If it‚Äôs not convertible, it‚Äôs like in-game currency.</li>
<li>Can be circulated as a medium of value while remaining separate from legal tender, which can be used to make transactions in the game to increase it and make changes favorable to you without being subject to taxation.</li>
<li>This is the meaning of the phrase ‚ÄúGlobal trade based on social networks, not money</li>
<li>The idea is that such a medium of value can be created and nurtured to increase its value. No one really knows how much the PMP tokens from the PluralityBook project will actually be worth, but the ‚ÄúAudrey Tan-Grenweil Game‚Äù has the potential to grow into an interesting game, and I feel like I‚Äôm participating in early access to it.</li>
<li>I‚Äôm betting on the one that grows, and I‚Äôm getting stock option-like tokens to help me work with it. Real stock options, of course, can run out of paper without going public. This is ultimately a gamble.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>Does this mean that it is up to the project owner to decide if it can be converted into actual money?
<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>It depends on the will; I don‚Äôt think PluralityBook‚Äôs PMP token will do it.‚Äù It would ruin ‚Äúwhat we want to achieve‚Äù which is ‚Äúglobal trade based on social networks, not money.
<ul>
<li>The decision to redeem depends on whether you want to redeem it or not, but basically I don‚Äôt want to redeem it.</li>
<li>Well, I think it depends on how much money people want.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>Would it be redeemable if the owner decided to buy it?
<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Oh, for example, if I were to say in my open source project, ‚ÄúIf you fix this bug, I will give you 10,000 credits, and I will buy them back for 1 yen per credit,‚Äù that would be a redeemable credit.
<ul>
<li>However, I believe the tax office will tell those who receive 10,000 credits to declare it as miscellaneous income and pay tax on it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>Whether or not to make it redeemable is how the project owner wants to do it, not a layer of the PMP itself?
<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Yes, outside of PMP, the Open Question in the PMP paper states [‚Äù While management credits are not by default monetary, the decision to distribute such rewards based on them must Therefore, the decision to distribute such rewards based on them must be made in the context of existing organizational cultures. He wrote.

<li>Currently, the value is managed in a ledger on Github, but if it were implemented to be output in <a href="./ERC-20" class="internal" data-slug="ERC-20">ERC-20</a> format on Ethereum, for example, it would be able to be exchanged on exchanges like existing cryptocurrencies.</li>
<li>What would be the problem if we did that, uh, what would be the problem?</li>
<li>Me personally, I wouldn‚Äôt want to do that because it would require me to pay taxes. That‚Äôs my perspective as an individual participating in the project.</li>
<li>For those managing the system, the quickest way to reduce the risk of someone with a lot of money coming in and taking the project is to not allow the money to be exchanged in the first place.</li>
<li>It is preferable to create a situation where only those who have actively contributed to the project can obtain the right to govern the project.</li>

<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>The issuance and distribution of tokens is the source of power. ‚Ä¶ Conversely, if it becomes too big to overlook, the state (or existing power) will want to control it. On the other hand, the state could ensure that the issuance and distribution of tokens is transparent and fair.
<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Does the state have control over tokens that have become too big to overlook, e.g. Bitcoin or Ethereum?
<ul>
<li>What exactly is control?</li>
<li>For example, if China wanted to control Ethereum and attacked servers in the U.S., the U.S. would be upset.</li>
<li>I understand the state‚Äôs desire to control, but you don‚Äôt have the ability to implement control. Isn‚Äôt <a href="./the-Network-State" class="internal alias" data-slug="the-Network-State">the Network State</a> stronger than the state? It‚Äôs a situation like that.</li>
<li>I think China is doing its best to control the flow of assets out of the country by converting them to Bitcoin and other forms of capital control, which they don‚Äôt like, but I think it will be a challenge to see how this area will develop.</li>

</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>I realized that PMP tokens are ‚Äúvirtues‚Äù in the sense that they are contributions to OSS projects, and that virtues and tokens are similar.

<ul>
<li>To put it in Christian terms, you are piling up wealth in that heaven. So, you are not spending your wealth in cash, Japanese yen, or other trivial assets on earth, but in this way, you are training and contributing in order to send wealth to the heavenly realms, and you are devoting your labor and loyalty to the realization of God‚Äôs Kingdom. Heavenly wealth does not need to be convertible into Japanese yen, nor do we want to. This kind of joke makes people think we are a cult. w</li>

<p>Changes in interactions due to technological developments affect the way public</p>
<ul>
<li>The reason why we are talking about telepathy and global trade is because we believe that ‚Äúchanges in interactions due to technological development will affect the way public life is conducted.</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Whose statement was it that if the way people interact with each other changes as a result of technological development, the structure of society needs to change as well?
<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/‚øªPlurality Assistant/icon" alt="‚øªPlurality Assistant.icon" height="19.5"/>With regard to the subject you are talking about, you seem to be referring to Glen Weyl‚Äôs idea that ‚Äútechnology changes the way people interact, so democracy needs to change with it. This idea is based on the thought of <a href="./John-Dewey" class="internal alias" data-slug="John-Dewey">John Dewey</a> that every time a new technology comes along, it changes the way people interact and therefore the form of democracy needs to change accordingly!</li>
</ul>

<li>Give Claude <a href="./John-Dewey" class="internal alias" data-slug="John-Dewey">John Dewey</a>‚Äôs <a href="./The-Public-and-Its-Problems" class="internal alias" data-slug="The-Public-and-Its-Problems">The Public and Its Problems</a>, which is available on the Gutenbeng Project, and ask questions (finally, my summary is in bold, so read there).</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Q: Quote and explain the part about ‚ÄúEvery time a new technology comes along, people interact in new ways.‚Äù
<ul>
<li>The following is the part of this statement that relates to the way technological developments are changing the way society interacts with each other.</li>
<li>‚Äú(English paragraph)‚Äù</li>
<li>In other words, as new technologies emerge, the consequences that result from them extend beyond the scope of those directly involved with them. Therefore, special institutions and measures are formed to deal with and manage the consequences, or existing groups must assume new functions. This leads to the organization of the public (public) or the state, the obvious external feature of which is described as the existence of public officials.</li>
<li>Thus, Dewey offers the insight that technological developments will change the way society interacts, and the public and the state will change in response. As new technologies have far-reaching effects on society, new mechanisms are required to manage them.</li>
</ul>

<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Summarize in bullet points, including before and after.</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/Claude/icon" alt="Claude.icon" height="19.5"/>Yes. The following is a summary, including the paragraphs before and after.
<ul>
<li>The consequences of interconnected actions may be spatially and temporally expansive, uniform, repetitive, and irreversible. The importance of such consequences is a matter of degree, and there are no clear boundaries within which the public (public) is created.</li>
<li>The public consists of recognizing indirect and lasting results and is organized as a state through special institutions to systematically manage its interests.

</ul>
</li>
<li>With the development of technology, the consequences of combined actions extend beyond the scope of those directly involved. Therefore, addressing and managing those consequences will require the formation of special agencies and measures, or the taking charge of new functions of existing groups.</li>
<li>An obvious external feature of the organization of the public and the state is the presence of public officials. Government is not the state, but includes both the public and the rulers who have special duties and powers. The public is organized through the civil service.</li>
<li>The main issue for the public is to achieve a self-awareness that will carry the weight of the public interest and influence the election of public officials and the definition of their responsibilities and rights.

<li>I think most people associate the term ‚Äúpublic servant‚Äù with ‚Äúsomeone who is paid by the government.‚Äù<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>
<ul>
<li>But here it means something a little different</li>
<li>For example, with the birth and spread of television technology, a ‚Äúruler with special authority‚Äù was born who had the power to decide ‚Äúwhat to broadcast on television. This was the ‚Äúcivil servant,‚Äù and the public at that time was organized through this civil servant.</li>
<li>Later, with the spread of social media, anyone could post and it was up to people to decide which posts to spread widely. Many ‚Äúinfluencers‚Äù were created who were referenced by many people, and through them a new public was formed.</li>
<li>The American perspective is that this is a problem because of the extreme divisions that are occurring as a result of this. There are more people who think there will be a civil war in the next decade than those who think there won‚Äôt, in the U.S. (<a href="./Majority-believe-civil-war-will-break-out-in-the-U.S." class="internal alias" data-slug="Majority-believe-civil-war-will-break-out-in-the-U.S.">Majority believe civil war will break out in the U.S.</a>).

I am getting worried about the translation of this book. I think you need to add a lot of notes to make the text easy to understand.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>As discussed in this book, books with a linear narrative structure have the major drawback of forcing all readers onto a single learning path. The online version avoids this problem by making extensive use of hyperlinks, but for those who have the paper book, it may be more difficult to read through. To alleviate some of this problem, we have structured our text in a ‚Äúcircular‚Äù fashion. Readers can start reading at various points, then continue from there, and finally come back to the ‚Äúprevious‚Äù part of the book.</p>

This was originally one of the CJK composite Kanji conventions. It is a Unicode character meant to represent the overlapping of multiple characters to create a new character. In this document, Plurality is represented by this. It expresses the feeling that people with different opinions should also overlap. The Unicode characters are perfect for expressing the idea that new and better things can be created by combining different things, and the process of replacing the words ‚Äúplurality‚Äù and ‚Äúplural‚Äù in the text with these pictograms began around March. The process of replacing all the words ‚Äúplurality‚Äù and ‚Äúplural‚Äù in the text with this pictogram was started in March.</li>

<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/claude/icon" alt="claude.icon" height="19.5"/>The following chapters are likely to be of most interest to corporate researchers in groupware.
<ol>
<li>6-1-Workplace
<ul>
<li>The chapter discusses improvements to the work environment, including strengthening remote teams, designing effective corporate campuses, improving communication, more inclusive access to talent, and more effective delivery of common corporate infrastructure. Groupware will be of great interest to researchers because it provides tools and technologies directly related to these issues.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>5-1-Post Symbolic Communication
<ul>
<li>It is stated that in the future, direct sensory sharing, such as telepathy, could fundamentally change human relationships and social structures. Groupware researchers are keenly interested in advances in communication technology, so the content of this chapter will be of interest to them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>5-3-Creative Collaboration
<ul>
<li>This chapter describes a vision of the future of creative collaboration that integrates human and non-human, past and future intelligence and harnesses collective creativity to address global challenges. Researchers will be interested in the content of this chapter because groupware is a tool that facilitates collaboration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>5-4-Extended Deliberation
<ul>
<li>It describes experimental attempts to improve the quality and depth of remote interaction using the latest technology. Groupware researchers are interested in improving the quality of remote communication and discussion, so the content of this chapter should appeal to them.</li>

<p>Many workplaces, especially white-collar jobs, are physically concentrated on large ‚Äúcorporate campuses.‚Äù While many of the functions concentrated on these campuses may be organizationally quite independent, extensive co-locations are aimed at providing opportunities for incidental interactions between different departments.
