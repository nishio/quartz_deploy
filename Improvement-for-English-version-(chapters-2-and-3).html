<ul>
<li>For example, a good cook can wash the cutting board used to cut the ingredients while waiting for the pot to heat up and the ingredients to cook, or prepare a plate to serve the cooked food. But someone just starting to learn to cook cannot do that. Those who are good at it know how long to wait for the food to cook and how long it takes to wash the cutting board. So they can make the decision, ‚ÄúI can wash the cutting board during the time it takes to wait for the fire to come on. Those who are just beginning to learn cannot make this judgment, so they cannot process in parallel.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>For example, a good cook can perform multiple cooking tasks simultaneously. While the ingredients are heating, they can wash the cutting board used to cut the ingredients or prepare a plate to serve the heated ingredients. But someone who is just beginning to learn to cook cannot do so. Those who are good at it know how long it takes to heat the ingredients and how long it takes to wash the cutting board. So they can determine that they can wash the cutting board while they are waiting for the ingredients to heat up. A person just beginning to learn does not know how long it takes. They cannot make this judgment. So they cannot do parallel processing.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Even when it appears that you are working on multiple tasks in parallel, you are doing one task at a time, switching between them as you go. Running multiple tasks in parallel means that you have the additional task of ‚Äúmaking the decision to switch between tasks‚Äù. If you are trying to do multiple tasks and feeling unmotivated or confused, first narrow it down to one thing to do and get it done one at a time.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Even when it seems that we do multiple tasks in parallel, we do only one task at each moment. We switch the target task rapidly. The switching cost is not zero. Executing multiple tasks in parallel has an additional task: the decision of task switching. The cost of switching is low for experts, high for novices. If you are trying to do more than one task and you are not motivated, let‚Äôs focus on one thing first and finish them one by one.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Because of the high cost of cleaning up ‚Äúthe whole room.‚Äù</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Because cleaning up ‚Äúthe whole room‚Äù takes time.</li>
</ul>
<p>The cost in this case is time cost, so I specified it clearly.</p>
<ul>
<li>In these situations, we often try to prioritize tasks.</li>

<p>I guess it‚Äôs ‚Äúhard to keep them in line.‚Äù</p>
<ul>
<li>In fact, many people have probably experienced spending more than three seconds thinking, ‚ÄúWhich should I do first?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In fact, many people spend more time wondering which task to prioritize.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>There is a naive definition of magnitude for one-dimensional values, and many people agree on it, so there are few discrepancies.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>There is a naive definition of magnitude for 1-dimensional values, and many people agree on it, so there is less disagreement about magnitude. Which do you think is bigger, 2 or 5?</li>
</ul>
<p>I filled in the blanks because it was unclear what the discrepancy was. Concrete examples were also added.</p>
<ul>
<li>If we consider x and y equally important and compare them by x + y, then C is the most important. if x is twice as important as y, then 5 * 2 + 2 == 4 * 2 + 4, so B and C are of equal importance.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>C is the most important because if you consider x and y equally important, you are comparing by the magnitude of x + y. If you consider x twice as important as y, you are comparing by x * 2 + y. Then, 5 * 2 + 2 == 4 * 2 + 4, so B and C are of equal importance.</li>
</ul>

<li>Discussing in advance will prevent time from being spent discussing what should be prioritized in a situation where time is short and tasks must be discarded.</li>

<p>Clarification since ‚Äúwhat‚Äù is ambiguous.</p>
<ul>
<li>Discussing in advance will prevent time from being spent discussing what should be prioritized in a situation where time is short and tasks must be discarded.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Often, situations arise where team members do not have time to perform all tasks and must choose which tasks to perform. By discussing this in advance, you can prevent time from being spent discussing what should be prioritized in this time-poor situation.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Is that really the right thing to do?</p>

<p>Is it really the right thing to do? Are the pre-determined priorities correct?</p>

<p>This argument assumes that the importance of tasks is independent, but in real software development, there are complex dependencies such as ‚Äúdoing task D will increase x in task A‚Äù or ‚Äúdoing task E will lower the implementation cost of task B‚Äù or ‚Äúit is cheaper for one person to implement tasks F and G together than to implement them separately. Tasks F and G are complexly intertwined with dependencies, such as ‚Äúthe cost of implementation is lower if one person implements tasks F and G together rather than separately.</p>

<ul>
<li>This argument assumes that task importance is independent. However, this is not the case in real software development. For example, the following phenomena occur.</li>

<li>If you do task D, you increase x in task A.</li>
<li>Doing Task E lowers the cost of implementing Task B.</li>

<li>In fact, when we asked some people, they responded that they would try each slot machine several times and choose the one with the best results.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I also added ‚Äúdo not play slots‚Äù as an option and ran a simulation experiment with 600 agents playing 1,000 times.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I conducted a simulation experiment in which 600 agents made 1,000 decisions in an environment with three slot machines. The decisions were made by each agent to choose one of four options: one of the three slot machines or ‚Äúdon‚Äôt play‚Äù.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Each agent was made to work with an algorithm that first played each slot three times and then chose the option with the highest expected value based on past experience. We prepared a ‚Äúvalue slot machine‚Äù in which some slots have a 0.3 probability of winning. Of course, each agent does not know this. Can the agents find the ‚Äúgood deal‚Äù slot machine through their trials?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Each agent will first play each slot machine three times. Then, after that, they choose the option with the highest expected value based on their own past experience. We have prepared a slot machine that has a 0.3 probability of winning 500 yen. The expected value of this slot machine is 150 yen; putting 100 yen into this slot machine is a good deal, so the optimal solution is to keep playing this slot. Of course, each agent does not know that such a slot machine exists, nor does he or she know which one it is. Will the agents discover through their experience the slot machine that offers the best value for their money?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The results of the experiment showed that a majority 57% of the agents were unaware of the value-for-money option and chose ‚Äúdo not play slots‚Äù.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The results of the experiment showed that a majority 57% of the agents did not find the best slot machine. The majority of them chose ‚Äúdo not play slots‚Äù.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In the field of reinforcement learning, this problem is called the ‚Äúexploitation exploitation tradeoff. If you only do what you ‚Äúthink is best based on past experience,‚Äù you will never find a better behavior. That is not enough exploration. On the other hand, if all you do is ‚Äúwhat you think is the best action based on past experience,‚Äù you will not find a better action! and ‚Äúinexperienced actions‚Äù only, you cannot take advantage of your past experience. That is lack of utilization.

<li>The wide confidence interval for A means that it may be much larger or much smaller than the average to date.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The confidence interval for A is wider than for B. This is because the uncertainty in A is higher; the advantage of doing A is that it may be much larger or much smaller than the average to this point in time.</li>

<ul>
<li>If we take this idea back to management, we are not judging by what we get on average by doing the task, but by what we get in the best case.</li>

<li>Cohn then insisted that we implement features with high monetary value and high risk first, then features with high monetary value and low risk, and finally features with low monetary value and low risk, but do not implement features with low monetary value and high risk.</li>

<p>In ‚ÄúBuild a Base First‚Äù (* page), we first put the ‚Äútasks that must be done today‚Äù as the top priority, but is this really correct? Are all of those ‚Äútasks that must be done today‚Äù really ‚Äúurgent and important‚Äù? We need to rethink this and say No to the unimportant ones.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In ‚ÄúBuilding a Base First‚Äù (* page), you first gave top priority to ‚Äútasks that must be done today‚Äù. Now you have to think about whether those ‚Äútasks that must be done today‚Äù are really all that important. You need to find the ones that are not important and say no.</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>If you have not written down the task, then you feel anxious that you might forget the task you have been notified about. This anxiety creates the misconception that you have to do that task immediately.

</ul>
<p>The goal of life is the top part of the pyramid.
There are two directions to thinking about life goals.
One direction is descending from the top to the bottom.
In this case, we decide the goal of life first. And then, we judge the daily choice of actions. Let ‚Äòs call the direction ‚Äú<a href="./top-down" class="internal" data-slug="top-down">top-down</a>.‚Äù</p>
<p>The opposite is ‚Äú<a href="./bottom-up" class="internal" data-slug="bottom-up">bottom-up</a>.‚Äù
In this case, we start from the daily choices. By observing daily decisions, we eventually find some common patterns from them. It is the <a href="./information-gathering" class="internal alias" data-slug="information-gathering">information gathering</a> and the <a href="./pattern-discovery" class="internal alias" data-slug="pattern-discovery">pattern discovery</a> we learn in Chapter 1. Through this <a href="./abstraction" class="internal" data-slug="abstraction">abstraction</a>, we finally get our goal of life as our own words.</p>
<p>A reference to Chapter 1 was also added.</p>
<p>Life goals are the top portion of the pyramid. There are two directions to think about life goals. They are the direction of descent and the direction of ascent.

This is the information gathering and pattern discovery that we learned about in Chapter 1. It is through the abstraction of this pattern discovery that we eventually verbalize our life goals.</p>

<li>
<p>The fact that the task is too big and the goal is too far away, or that the task seems vaguely large due to lack of estimation of the task size, seems to be holding them back.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>They think the task looks big because they can‚Äôt estimate the size of the task. That undermines their motivation.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The population here is precisely the 52% of those who answered that they would not be able to finish in four hours, and who were able to answer what they would do in the first 25 minutes, and 58% of those who were motivated by being told to do that.</li>
</ul>
<p>To be precise, the denominator is A-C below.
A: Respondents who answered that they would not be finished within 4 hours

<li>Since many people cannot write in this kind of large task state, it is common to divide the task into a ‚Äúset a deadline for each chapter‚Äù task division.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If we regard writing as a big task, writing motivation is difficult to keep.</li>
<li>Therefore it is common to divide the task into each chapter and set the deadline for each chapter.</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>I am working on an intellectual production task at this very moment: writing a book. This task is another task that is too big to estimate time.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>To motivate myself for this major task of writing a book, I divide the major task of writing a book into three phases: writing down ideas and making a fusen, rearranging the fusen to come up with a structure, and drafting the manuscript based on the structure.</li>
</ul>
<p>To motivate me for this big task of ‚Äúwriting a book‚Äù,
I have broken down the task into the following three phases</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Write down ideas and make a fusen</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rearrange the fusen and think about the structure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a manuscript based on the composition</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For example, <a href="./Tadatsugu-Kobayashi" class="internal alias" data-slug="Tadatsugu-Kobayashi">Tadatsugu Kobayashi</a> argues that the maximum duration of human concentration is 2 hours, so if the breakdown of a task is longer than 2 hours, it is necessary to break it down further and clarify the goal of each task. For example, <a href="./Tadatsugu-Kobayashi" class="internal alias" data-slug="Tadatsugu-Kobayashi">Tadatsugu Kobayashi</a> argues that the maximum duration of human concentration is two hours, so if the result of breaking down a task is more than two hours, it is necessary to break it down further and clarify the goal of each task.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>It is believed that there is a limit to how long humans can sustain <a href="./(powers-of)-concentration" class="internal alias" data-slug="(powers-of)-concentration">(powers of) concentration</a>. For example, <a href="./Tadatsugu-Kobayashi" class="internal alias" data-slug="Tadatsugu-Kobayashi">Tadatsugu Kobayashi</a> argues that human concentration can last up to 2 hours, and if a task takes longer than 2 hours, it is necessary to break it down into smaller tasks and clarify the goal of each task.</li>

<p>2.3.2.1 Limitations of Concentration Within
In terms of volume, ‚ÄúImagine hiking on a mountain trail.‚Äù It would be better to have a subheading before the

<ul>
<li>Time, which tends to be viewed as continuous, is cut into pieces of a fixed length and named ‚Äúpomodoro,‚Äù and the size of the task is estimated by the ‚Äúnumber‚Äù of pieces.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>‚ÄúTime‚Äù is often seen as continuous. Cut off a fixed length of time and name it ‚ÄúPomodoro‚Äù. This allows us to estimate the size of the task in terms of the ‚Äúnumber‚Äù of pomodoros.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Note 20: Some people mistakenly think that the length of 25 minutes has some profound meaning, but length has no meaning. For those who cannot concentrate for 25 minutes, I suggest shortening it to 10 or 15 minutes.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Note 20 Some people mistakenly think that 25 minutes has some profound meaning, but length has no meaning. If you have trouble concentrating for 25 minutes, I encourage you to try shortening it to 5 or 10 minutes.</li>

<p>Stop being indirect and be direct. Shorter time.</p>

<li>
<p>Make a list of tasks for the day.</p>

<li>
<p>Estimate the size of the task in terms of the number of pomodoros.</p>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>1 pomodoro (25 minutes) timer starts at the beginning of the task</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>During one pomodoro, focus on one thing without changing tasks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an interruption by you or others occurs, record it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1When you are able to continue in a pomodoro focused state, switch perspectives by standing up and taking a few steps, etc. Note 21</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the Pomodoro timer had not sounded, I might have continued to work in a bad way without realizing a better way, with a narrow perspective that kept my viewpoint close to the problem.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If I had not used the Pomodoro timer I would have continued to work in a bad way without realizing a better way. Concentration brings perspective closer to the problem and narrows the field of view.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>To estimate how many pomodoros each task can be done in, first estimate the amount of tasks that can be done in one pomodoro, actually do them, and observe the discrepancies. Gradually, the accuracy of estimation improves.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>To be able to estimate how many pomodoros each task can be done in, you first need to know how many tasks you can do in one pomodoro. Through the experience of completing tasks that you thought could be completed in one pomodoro but were not, or conversely, completed quickly, you will gradually improve your estimation accuracy.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Note 22 This is much like conducting experiments to verify understanding.</li>

<li>A normal rat is probably using the information from ‚Äúlandmark visibility‚Äù that it can directly observe to create a memory of ‚Äúscaffold location‚Äù that it cannot directly observe. This is why they can quickly reach the scaffold even if they start from a different location.

<li>In Morris‚Äô water maze experiment, rats cannot directly observe the location of the scaffold, but rats can observe the surrounding landmarks. Normal rats probably create a memory of the location of the scaffold that they cannot directly observe, based on how they see the landmarks that they can directly observe. So, even if they start from a different location, they can quickly reach the scaffold.</li>
<li>On the other hand, a rat with a broken hippocampus would only remember the specific steps of how it swam to the scaffold after being dropped into the water.

<p>The book is a turning point of the history of the philosophy.</p>

<li>Please note that I have read the book I am referring to in this book four times. I read the book at least once in the planning stage to come up with the idea of mentioning the book, read it a second time so that I can figure out which pages have the content I want to mention before writing the manuscript, read it a third time carefully to find the parts I want to mention, and close the book while writing the manuscript because it would become overly detailed if I write the manuscript while reading it, Finally, I read it a fourth time for confirmation. However, if you only read through the book thoroughly, you have only read it 0 to 1 time.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I have referred to the contents of many books in this book. If you only call reading through the book thoroughly ‚Äúreading‚Äù, then I have read most of the book only once. What exactly is your reading process? I have read a book once in the past, just enough to come up with ‚ÄúI‚Äôll mention that book‚Äù in the planning stage. Then I read it a second time so that I know which pages I want to mention before writing the manuscript. Just before writing, I read carefully the section I want to mention. This is the third time. I do not look at the book when I am writing the manuscript, as reading the book while writing can lead to excessive detail. Finally, I read the book a fourth time to make sure the content is correct. In other words, if you count a rough reading as one reading, I read the book at least four times.</li>

<li>This ‚Äúyour experience‚Äù seems to include ‚Äúyour ability to gather information to extract useful information from books,‚Äù ‚Äúthe experiences you have had,‚Äù and ‚Äúyour ability to construct models based on your experiences and information gathered from books.</li>
</ul>
<p>This doesn‚Äôt have all three types, does it?</p>
<p>‚ÄúYour experience points‚Äù is a metaphor of role-playing games. By collecting the experience points, the ability of the in-game character grows. For reading, there are three ability:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the ability to collect useful information from books</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the ability to recall your experiences including information you learned before</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the ability to build models based on your experiences and information from books</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I learned that there are similarities between reading source code and reading books, where the focus is on the folder hierarchy and table of contents.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I learned that reading source code and reading books have something in common in that they focus on folder hierarchies and tables of contents. Both are hierarchical, location-based organizations of information.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If you compare the writings of an old person in his/her youth with those of his/her later years, you will find that the content has changed unexpectedly. If this is the case, then it is highly likely that the author of a book released this year will think differently 30 years from now!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The philosopher Wittgenstein pointed out a serious error in a book he had written some 25 years later. Since even a smart person like him can make mistakes, the authors of the books released this year will make mistakes too.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>However, new evidence may be discovered that changes the interpretation of the old history, or even the more recent history may be interpreted differently by neighboring countries, causing controversy.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is more of a science story than a history story.</p>
<p>-4.4.1.2 Books that require external reference
-Whether the reader has the knowledge that the author assumes also has a significant impact on how the book is read.</p>
<ul>
<li>The author does not know what knowledge the reader has. So the author assumes that the reader has some knowledge.
+If the reader does not have the required knowledge, he/she must first refer to an outside book to gain the required knowledge in order to understand the book‚Äôs content.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>So the author thinks, ‚ÄúThis is something that can be easily found by searching the Internet without having to devote paper space to explain it.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Even if a piece of knowledge is unknown to the reader, the reader can quickly learn it by searching the Internet. If the author thinks so, the author will not devote paper space to explaining that knowledge.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The climbing type of book is a type of book that builds up concepts. If you neglect the front part of the book, you will have problems later. The hiking type is a book that describes various concepts one after another.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because you don‚Äôt know the total amount of ‚Äúwhat is in the book‚Äù, you cannot judge on your own whether you have understood 100% of it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Because you don‚Äôt know the total amount of ‚Äúwhat the author wanted to convey in this book,‚Äù you cannot judge on your own whether you understood 100% of the book.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In some cases, the value is not in extracting the content of a single book, but in combining the content of the book with the rest of the knowledge.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We tend to focus our attention on the information ‚Äúinside‚Äù a book. Often, however, there is value in combining the information inside the book with information outside the book.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I have listed several purposes for reading, but my best recommendation is to use it for the purpose of creating review material.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>So far we have introduced three purposes for reading. In this section, we will introduce another purpose. It is to create material for review.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have reconsidered that we should not say ‚Äúthe best recommendation‚Äù when we are trying to present various options and encourage readers to make a choice based on their individual situations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I advocated that we should concentrate and create ‚Äú<a href="./Leverage-memo" class="internal alias" data-slug="Leverage-memo">Leverage memo</a>‚Äù.
after</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Here‚Äôs the leverage memo I made after reading this book</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>80% of the content of a text is in 20% of the text; take 80% in 20% of the time, leverage notes and discard the original. Read it repeatedly and enrich it further.
Add</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>However, by designing memos that had to be enriched or added to when they were read back, memos that I couldn‚Äôt think of anything in particular to edit accumulated as tasks waiting to be worked on.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>However, because I defined ‚Äúto review‚Äù as ‚Äúmake it shorter or longer,‚Äù the review process becomes painful. I made a ‚Äúto review‚Äù list in the service. If a note has nothing to remove or add, it remains in the list. The pile of tasks harms motivation.</li>
<li>In hindsight, I should have kept the cost of review as low as possible. Editing is too costly; a review in Anki is one click away. That‚Äôs why it can be done in short gaps of time.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You are betting on the possibility that by making it public, you will plant a seed, which will gradually grow as you receive feedback, and over time, your understanding will grow into a large tree.</li>
</ul>

<li>By making it public, you plant a seed, which gradually grows with feedback, and over time, the understanding within you grows into a large tree. Would you like to bet on this possibility?</li>

<p>The subject matter was unclear.</p>
