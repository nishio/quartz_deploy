<pre><code>&lt;body>
*1407556873* I taught my wife public key cryptography.
I was casually turning on the Open University, and they were talking about public key cryptography.

Wife: &quot;I can't tell you how many times I've heard this story.&quot;
I said, &quot;Well, what part don't you understand? How far do you get?&quot;
Wife: &quot;I understand plain text, but I don't understand sharing a key, keeping it secret, or signing it.&quot;
I said, &quot;Oh, you're comparing it to a key, which is counterproductive.&quot;

** Designate &quot;key&quot; as a NG word

I said, &quot;Well, let me explain without using the word 'key. In cryptography, you send a message by converting plain text into cipher text, and the recipient gets the original message by converting the cipher text back into plain text. The purpose of this is so that the contents of the communication will not be revealed even if an enemy takes the communicated text along the way.&quot;
Wife: &quot;Yes.&quot;
I said, &quot;In the old days, if you knew one way of encryption, you knew the other way. For example, if someone told me, 'If you shift one letter backward in the alphabet, you can return it to plaintext,' I would understand, 'I see, if you shift one forward in the alphabet, you can make it into ciphertext. But one day, a wonderful method of encryption was invented in which one side is understood but the other side is not.&quot;
Wife &quot;Ho&quot;
I said, &quot;In other words, it is now safe to disclose 'how to turn plain text into cipher text' to the general public. Even if I do that, I can keep the 'how to convert ciphertext back to plaintext' as only I know it. That way, anyone who wants to send me a secret text can create a cipher using the publicly available encryption method, and I will be the only one who can read it.&quot;
My wife said, &quot;Well, that's convenient.&quot;
I said, &quot;On the other hand, if I create a ciphertext using a method that is not open to the public, everyone can read it back into plaintext using a method that is open to the public. People can use it as a signature because they can see that 'in order to create this ciphertext, I need to use an encryption method known only to NISHIO Hirokazu = it was written by NISHIO Hirokazu'.&quot;
My wife said, &quot;So you're talking about signatures in the cipher story. By the way, are you going to disclose how to make it into ciphertext? Are you going to disclose how to convert it back to plaintext?&quot;
I said, &quot;Ah, we have been calling them 'method of converting to ciphertext' and 'method of converting back to plaintext' for convenience, but if we call them Method A and Method B, you can use Method A to make ciphertext and Method B to convert back to plaintext, or you can use Method B to make ciphertext and Method A to convert back to plaintext. But if you make it with A, you must use B, and if you make it with B, you must use A.&quot; ((Note: Strictly speaking, there are encryption methods that have this &quot;can be used in the opposite direction&quot; feature and those that do not... and the details are omitted here...))
Wife: &quot;I see, so if you publish one method A, you can use it to accept ciphertexts and to publish information with signatures.&quot;

** &quot;Key&quot;

I said, &quot;The method on the public side is called 'public key' and the method on the non-public side is called 'private key'... To be honest, they are quite different from the common image of the word 'key'. For example, if you open a safe with a normal key, you can both put it in and take it out. But the key to this invention is that we have created a method that allows you to get into the safe but not out.&quot;
Wife: &quot;I often try to make it easy to understand and draw illustrations of a golden key and a silver key, but it doesn't make sense to me at all.&quot;
I said, &quot;I wonder what kind of things have the one-way characteristic of being able to put them in but not being able to take them out. For example, anyone can put a postcard in the mailbox, but only I can open the mailbox after it is mailed. Of course, this assumes that the postal worker in the communication channel does not leak the information. Or, in the opposite direction, this blog can be read by anyone, but only I can rewrite it, so everyone will believe that I wrote what I write here.

** Postscript

A good analogy was written in a buzzard comment, so I reprint it. Anyone can close a padlock, but only the person who has the key can open it. Therefore, if I keep the padlock in a place where anyone can get to it, only I can open the box by locking it with the padlock and sending it to me. I think this is a good way to explain one-way communication.

&lt;body>I will explain the image of a public key as a &quot;key&quot; and a &quot;lock&quot; that can only be opened with the private key that you have. Because it is a lock, it is safe to open it to everyone. &lt;/body>.

&lt;body>I can imagine encryption with a padlock, but I can't imagine a signature, &lt;/body>.

&lt;body>I'm not sure, but is the public key the product of prime numbers and the private key one of the prime numbers? &lt;br>When 3*7=21, the public key is 21 and the private key is 3 or 7? &lt;br>Does this mean that method A is 21 and method B is 3 or 7? &lt;/body>

&lt;body>tes-san&lt;br>What I have explained here is why public key cryptography came to be widely used (what advantages it had), in other words, why. &lt;br>What Mr. tes is asking about, on the other hand, is the how, in other words, how to realize it in concrete terms. The layers are completely different. &lt;BR>&lt;BR>As for the next part of your question, please read the Wikipedia page on RSA ciphers, as I am not able to explain the details in the comments section. &lt;BR>&lt;BR>To put it simply, the public key contains information on the product of 21 prime numbers, and the private key is created using (3 - 1) * (7 - 1). &lt;br>If the prime numbers are large enough, the information of the product pq of prime numbers contained in the public key cannot be obtained in realistic time to find (p - 1) * (q - 1) from it, which is how we achieve &quot;publishing one key but not knowing the other&quot;. &lt;/body>

&lt;comment>
&lt;username>bleu-bleut&lt;/username>
&lt;body>As long as the public key is published, the question is that if anyone can decrypt the encryption with the private key, it is not a cipher in the first place... Is there more to the story to communicate without leaking to others? &lt;/body>
&lt;timestamp>1411607121&lt;/timestamp>
&lt;/comment>
&lt;comment>
&lt;username>yuu&lt;/username>
&lt;body>> Mr. bleu-bleut&lt;br>&lt;br>The text mentions two ways of using it. &lt;BR>&lt;BR>First, the keys A and B are equivalent. &lt;BR>If you encrypt with A, you can decrypt with B. &lt;BR>If you encrypt with B, you can decrypt with A. &lt;BR>If you encrypt with A, you cannot decrypt with A. &lt;BR>If you encrypt with B, you cannot decrypt with B. &lt;BR>&lt;BR>With this in mind. &lt;BR>&lt;BR>You have A as your private key, and only you have B as your public key. &lt;BR>B is distributed as a public key. &lt;BR>&lt;BR>The first is the normal usage. &lt;BR>&lt;BR>If you want to send an encrypted message to yourself, encrypt it with B and send it. &lt;br>The ciphertext can only be decrypted by A, so it is safe even if it is eavesdropped! &lt;br>This is how it works. &lt;br>If the other party also wants to receive encrypted communications, &lt;br>the other party must distribute a public key to the other party and encrypt with that public key. &lt;BR>Of course, decryption is done with the private key that only the other party has. &lt;BR>&lt;BR>Next, the second use as authentication. &lt;BR>The same is true for A is the private key and B is the public key. &lt;br>If you can decrypt a ciphertext encrypted with A, which only you have, with B, &lt;br>you can guarantee that it was sent from you, who definitely has the A key. &lt;br>So it doesn't matter if anyone can decrypt it. &lt;/body>
&lt;timestamp>1436876553&lt;/timestamp>
&lt;/comment>
&lt;comment>
&lt;username>torisugari&lt;/username>
&lt;body>I think maybe the expression &quot;key&quot; is the source of confusion&lt;br>Because we are talking about information, there is no such thing as a physical &quot;key&quot; &lt;br>The method used to encrypt and compound information is metaphorically called a key&lt;/body>.
