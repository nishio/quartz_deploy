The Liberal-Communitarian Debate</p>
<ul>
<li>A controversy that flourished about 50 years ago.
<ul>
<li>Abstract discussion at the time</li>
<li>What was discussed in theoretical philosophy appeared in secular society about two generations (roughly 60 years) later.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>1971, John Rawls, “<a href="./justification" class="internal" data-slug="justification">justification</a>”
<ul>
<li>Revolution of Theoretical Liberalism</li>
<li>The book that created the theoretical framework for today’s liberalism.</li>
<li>Rawls.
<ul>
<li>While “<a href="./utilitarianism" class="internal" data-slug="utilitarianism">utilitarianism</a>,” which is “to be <a href="./what-is-justice" class="internal alias" data-slug="what-is-justice">what is justice?</a> <a href="./GBM" class="internal" data-slug="GBM">GBM</a>,” functions as the dominant ethical philosophy in Anglo-Saxon society, the negative aspects of utilitarianism have a fatal negative impact on the real world. . is having a fatal negative impact on the real world?”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>atomic bombing (bombing)
<ul>
<li>One of the moral grounds is utilitarianism</li>
<li>Secretary Stimson, who oversaw the Manhattan Project, believed that the bombing would save more American and Japanese lives.</li>
<li>Maximum happiness for the “greatest number.”
<ul>
<li>This is the moral basis for the atomic bombings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rawls thought this was a mistake.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rawls.
<ul>
<li>utilitarianism makes the misfortune of the few perceived as morally right, and in fact causes them to act that way</li>
<li>You say utilitarianism is the greatest happiness for the greatest number, but if you were on the side of the oppressed minority, you wouldn’t agree that it is morally right, would you?
<ul>
<li>Is utilitarianism such a “dumb” concept that it hinders the operation of the real world?</li>
<li>That’s not a universal righteousness, is it?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Then a society in which people from any position or circumstance can agree with each other is the most just society that is not dubious, isn’t it?
<ul>
<li>→ <a href="./Veil-of-ignorance" class="internal alias" data-slug="Veil-of-ignorance">Veil of ignorance</a></li>
<li>The rules that can be established by interchanging the positions and viewpoints of all people are the standards of correctness envisioned by today’s liberalism.
<ul>
<li>Hence, anti-racist.</li>
<li>There are not that many things that are socially right, only the minimum necessary to support a just society.
<ul>
<li>Anything beyond that is more a matter of <a href="./diversity" class="internal" data-slug="diversity">diversity</a> than correctness, so let’s be tolerant of each other.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>communitarian
- <a href="./communitarianism" class="internal" data-slug="communitarianism">communitarianism</a>
- <a href="./View-the-individual-as-the-starting-point-of-society" class="internal alias" data-slug="View-the-individual-as-the-starting-point-of-society">View the individual as the starting point of society</a> is <a href="./individualism" class="internal" data-slug="individualism">individualism</a>.
- Communitarianism believes that the community is the starting point of society because it is the community that nurtures the individual.
<ul>
<li>
<p>The “liberal-communitarian controversy” that was so popular in American political philosophy circles in the 1980s.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Liberal-Communitarian Debate Revisited (Shigeki Uno).”
- Sandel counters by presenting the concept of the unencumbered self.
- The human being in his primordial state, behind the “veil of ignorance” as Rawls calls it, is merely an abstract self stripped of its historical and social attributes.
- However, can such an abstract self really make moral judgments?
- Humans live in a historically and socially situated world.
- Such a <a href="./A-person-disconnected-from-the-situation" class="internal alias" data-slug="A-person-disconnected-from-the-situation">A person disconnected from the situation</a> is, so to speak, a deprived self that has no attachment to anything and is unable to reflect on “who I am.
- Thus, such an argument of Rawls cannot choose the good or constitute justice,
- This is Sandel’s conclusion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cancel Culture</p>
<ul>
<li>The human being in his primordial state, behind the veil of ignorance, is merely an abstract self stripped of historical and social attributes.
<ul>
<li>Asking someone to think in an anti-discriminatory manner means asking them to “strip away their historical and social attributes” and become a naked individual.
<ul>
<li>The Logic of Cancellation Culture</li>
<li>The occupation of a partner is nothing but the fruit of the historical and social attributes of the person and the community, including luck.
<ul>
<li>So, if we cancel (strip away) the profession and think of ourselves as naked individuals, we will be able to look at things in an anti-discriminatory way.</li>
<li>For a discriminatory person to come to see things in an antidiscriminatory way requires that he or she be stripped of the historical and relational ties to the community that are internalized in him or her.</li>
<li>In the process, the person positioned within the community is reduced to a “deprived self,” a self to which one is not attached and does not want to be.
<ul>
<li>Sandel feared that liberals would do this to themselves, but he never expected it, and I personally summed it up by saying that the real world has reached a stage where liberal thinking has “done it to others,” exceeding Sandel’s expectations at the time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In fact, Rawls accepted some of the criticisms of Sandel and others, and about 20 years later, “political liberalism”</p>
<ul>
<li>The modification is that “it was not a very good idea to think of the load on the self (history and social attributes in the community) as being stripped away.
<ul>
<li>Rawls.
<ul>
<li>Originally a critique of utilitarianism
<ul>
<li>There are situations where utilitarianism can work.</li>
<li>can be fatally misleading at a morally critical juncture.
<ul>
<li>Atomic bombing of Hiroshima, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sandel et al.
<ul>
<li>I understand that utilitarianism is dangerous, but isn’t liberal thinking, as you call it, also theoretically at risk?”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rawls.
<ul>
<li>The veil of ignorance is only a thought experiment</li>
<li>Once you’re veiled and once you’re free of all attributes, you could be at a disadvantage, so you wouldn’t be in favor of a rule that would particularly disadvantage one position over another, even if you think about it in terms of profit and loss, would you?”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sandel et al.
<ul>
<li>No, no, no. Seriously, if you think about it that way, it’s not good. The idea of stripping away your attributes once you think about it in a normal way is pretty dangerous.”</li>
<li>Gunnu. Indeed.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Main Claims
<ul>
<li>Tatsuo Inoue’s point is succinct and is quoted verbatim
<ul>
<li>Rawls says, “In a liberal society, with its pluralistic division of religious and philosophical positions, such a principle of justice that can only be accepted if it relies on a contentious philosophical position is not good enough.</li>
<li>So what would support that, Rolls says, is “overlapping sonsensus.”</li>
<li>From any philosophical or religious doctrine, we can share only the conclusion, though for different reasons. It’s like “living on the same bed, dreaming on the same bed.”</li>
<li>That kind of thing is called “overlapping consensus.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>So far we have seen three political philosophies: utilitarianism, liberalism, and communitarianism.
<ul>
<li>Utilitarianism, which justifies minority oppression, is criticized by liberalism,</li>
<li>Liberalism, which calls for the cancellation of the real “life” of living in a community, is criticized by communitarianism,</li>
<li>And communitarianism, which has no principle for mediating conflicts between different communities, is criticized for utilitarianism.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I personally feel that it is significant that Rawls, who started out as an idealistic liberalist, met “political realism” (realism) in his later years.</li>
</ul>
