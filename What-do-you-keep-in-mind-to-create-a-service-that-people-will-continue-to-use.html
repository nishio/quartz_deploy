Therefore, it is necessary to reach the users, and to do so, it is necessary to release the product. You may think it is obvious, but this means that we have to look at “how to release” properly.</p>

We are very fortunate to be able to do that.</p>

The third is knowledge. For example, let’s say a program you just wrote runs for 3 years without maintenance, and then 3 years later it needs to be modified. Where is the source code? If you read the code, it’s so dirty that you don’t know where to tweak it to achieve your goal. You want to rewrite the whole thing…</p>

In the end, you will have to debug at the same cost as when you created the old version, or decipher the old code at a cost.</p>

For example, programming languages, frameworks and libraries are updated. When I was a university student, I was working on a visualization program that ran on JavaApplet. Now I would have made it in JavaScript and Canvas. I did not port it.</p>

You won’t always be interested in what you are interested in now, and you won’t always be able to use your time the same way you do now.
For example, when I entered college, I found something I was more interested in, and I was so absorbed in it that I didn’t have time for it. Can you maintain the web service you created in high school at such a time?</p>
