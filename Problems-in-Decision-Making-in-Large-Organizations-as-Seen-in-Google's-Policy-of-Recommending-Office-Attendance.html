[The problem of decision-making in large organizations as seen in <a href="./Google's-policy-of-recommending-office-attendance" class="internal alias" data-slug="Google's-policy-of-recommending-office-attendance">Google‚Äôs policy of recommending office attendance</a>.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/Claude/icon" alt="Claude.icon" height="19.5"/>In this series of tweets, the following concerns and points were raised in response to Google‚Äôs policy of encouraging employees to work in the office at least three days per week.</p>
<ul>
<li>The problem with prioritizing the wishes of the majority despite the possibility of lower productivity for the minority (those who want to work remotely).</li>
<li>Emphasizing the trivial <a href="./importance-of-conversations" class="internal alias" data-slug="importance-of-conversations">importance of conversations</a> in the office while failing to consider the impact on <a href="./individual-productivity" class="internal alias" data-slug="individual-productivity">individual productivity</a>.</li>
<li>The decision was made without fully examining the results of the <a href="./telecommuting" class="internal" data-slug="telecommuting">telecommuting</a> ‚Äúexperiment‚Äù that began in the wake of the epidemic.</li>
<li>Things are being done as if they are <a href="./rational" class="internal" data-slug="rational">rational</a> decisions without rational and acceptable explanations.</li>
<li>The illusion of acting on data and operating while <a href="./rounding-down-outliers" class="internal alias" data-slug="rounding-down-outliers">rounding down outliers</a> in the real world.</li>
<li>If outliers are intentionally truncated, <a href="./accountability" class="internal" data-slug="accountability">accountability</a> should be fulfilled.</li>
<li>that those who make the decision to change policy are in a position not to be directly affected by the change.
These points highlight the problems of decision-making in large organizations, such as <a href="./the-impact-of-prioritizing-the-will-of-the-majority-on-the-minority" class="internal alias" data-slug="the-impact-of-prioritizing-the-will-of-the-majority-on-the-minority">the impact of prioritizing the will of the majority on the minority</a>, the seemingly insufficient emphasis on data and rationality in practice, and the disconnect between decision-makers and those affected by their decisions.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, it is not realistic to base all decisions on data, and some degree of separation is necessary. However, in making such decisions, we must be accountable to those who will be affected.</p>
<ul>
<li>This highlights the difficulty of ensuring <a href="./transparency" class="internal" data-slug="transparency">transparency</a> and <a href="./accountability" class="internal" data-slug="accountability">accountability</a> in <a href="./Organizational-Decision-Making" class="internal alias" data-slug="Organizational-Decision-Making">Organizational Decision-Making</a>, while respecting <a href="./diverse-values" class="internal alias" data-slug="diverse-values">diverse values</a> and <a href="./Diverse-ways-of-working" class="internal alias" data-slug="Diverse-ways-of-working">Diverse ways of working</a>. In order to deal with these issues, decision-making is necessary. To address these issues, it is important to make the decision-making process transparent, listen to the voices of those affected, and be accountable.</li>
</ul>

In fact, it is too costly and impractical to base every single decision on data. Therefore, I think it is sometimes necessary to make a decision at the last moment, and that is how the real world works. While cutting off outliers.</p>
