<p>Tachikawa: We are moving at a pretty good pace right now. More than I expected. Let‚Äôs take a look back at what we have done so far and see what you think.
Nishio: Yes, that‚Äôs right. Especially for the first time.
Male Y: At first, I still didn‚Äôt get the gist of it.
Tachikawa: I was getting really good at the end.
Male Y: I didn‚Äôt know how to bluff, so I tried to find out what would happen if a werewolf revealed himself as a werewolf, and I learned that, according to the theory, he would be revealed as a werewolf. What was interesting was that I felt that everyone had a certain expectation that this kind of person would confess in this way. I was not sure at first, so the second time, I let myself see what kind of conversation would take place. I learned a little bit more about how to do it, and I realized that it was okay to say something peripheral to what I was saying, and that it was also effective to blurt it out.
Nishio: Yes, yes. The game becomes more interesting. Whether it leads to victory or not, the game becomes more interesting.
Male Y: That‚Äôs what I mean. But in that sense, the point of this game is that you have to quickly identify who your allies are.
Nishio: In that sense, werewolves have an advantage because they know each other.
Male Y: That‚Äôs what I mean.
Nishio: It seems to be a good balance with the disadvantage of having a small number of people instead.
Male Y: It‚Äôs like that.
Tachikawa: I see.
Nishio: „Äì01:05:48 alteration? „ÄìWhere here two people were werewolves. I‚Äôd like to bite again.
Man X: Yeah. So I got spoiled. So we became like a team and defended each other, so I probably didn‚Äôt have enough power to argue by myself. I became a werewolf by myself.
Tachikawa: I was spoiled by Mr. Nishio.
Male X: Spoiled.
Male Y: (laughs)
Nishio: This kind of relationship emerged spontaneously when we were working with this group, but it would be different if we worked with different members.
Male Y: I‚Äôm sure it will come out.
Nishio: The perception of this person as a character who does this kind of thing is a little different every time.
Male Y: Oh, I see.
Nishio: I may be giving off a dependable vibe this time. But I think it will be more like, ‚ÄúThis guy is in trouble, we have to kill him quickly.
Tachikawa: A pattern to be wary of.
Nishio: Tachikawa-san was very cautious this time, wasn‚Äôt he?
Tachikawa: Indeed.
Nishio: I was fortunate in that it worked out that way.
Tachikawa: I was also on the lookout for the entire game except for the second half. It was like I was always being caught. Why is that?
Nishio: Why. My interpretation is that these two are familiar with each other and will be perceived as knowing each other well. In that case, there is a pattern where one of them will be wary and one of them will be trusted, so that has to be defeated by one of them first.
Man Y: I see.
Tachikawa: Ah.
Nishio: I have to somehow draw the perception that Mr. Tachikawa is an unreliable character.
Male Y: You mean that the character could be established in the game.
Tachikawa: I‚Äôm afraid of character slip-ups.
Male Y: I see. That‚Äôs interesting.
Man X: I‚Äôve been thinking about things that are quite out of character for me. I joined this game because I wanted to act as sincere as possible because relationships will continue after this wargame is over.
Nishio: I do that too. Sometimes. There is a pattern where I act sincere and keep giving an aura that I am a sincere lecturer. But if a werewolf comes along depending on the cards I draw, there is nothing I can do. (laughs) You must not lie.
Male Y: You shouldn‚Äôt. Because of the nature of the game.
Male X: So if I don‚Äôt deceive myself in order to enjoy the game, I can‚Äôt fool myself into thinking that I am in danger of lying.
Tachikawa: Oh, that‚Äôs true. I feel that ‚Äúyou are a strong wargamer‚Äù is somehow not a compliment.
Nishio: Well, you have to separate the game from reality.
Tachikawa: True. Yes, that‚Äôs true. I think it‚Äôs great that people lie when they are werewolves in a werewolf game.
Tachikawa: Because
Male X: Oh, yeah. They make the game fun.
Tachikawa: Because yes. Because they are doing it with the spirit of service, to entertain everyone with their games. However, there seems to be a general perception that people who are good at werewolf are people of bad character.
Nishio: I wonder if so. Maybe some people think so.
Tachikawa: People often say to me. When I do that at a gathering of beginners, they say, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to lie too much.‚Äù or something like that.
Male Y: Eh~.
Nishio: There are people who think they are on the right side if they say they don‚Äôt want to lie.
Man X: I said I have a bad character because I am aware of those parts of myself that are not good.
Nishio: I am not lying, I am standing on the side of honesty, so I am good and that person who opposes me is evil. This is a common psychological pattern.
Man X: Yes, yes, yes.
Tachikawa: I see.
Male X: There is no heart next to the sex of the personality. It is a raw personality.
Nishio: I have no heart.
Tachikawa: This?
Man Y: The Rinshinben.
Nishio: I want you to write a rishinben.
Man X: Also, the only ally is taste.
Tachikawa: That‚Äôs terrible. I couldn‚Äôt write a marriage marriage the other day, so I had to get a customer to do it.
All: (laughs)
Male Y: That‚Äôs hard.
Male X: The one used after the name.
Tachikawa: What was that? Oh, yes.
Male X: So you‚Äôre great for making the game fun.
Tachikawa: It is my perception.
Nishio: That‚Äôs right. I was not at all aware that I was lying to make the game fun. It was just for me to win.
Tachikawa: Ah.
Man X: Well, you know. It depends.
Nishio: To each his own.
Tachikawa: If the person who drew a werewolf says, ‚ÄúI drew a werewolf, so I don‚Äôt want to play. Tachikawa: If the person who drew a werewolf says, ‚ÄúI drew a werewolf and I don‚Äôt want to play,‚Äù the game won‚Äôt work.
Nishio: Yeah. It‚Äôs like the game is over the moment you say, ‚ÄúI was a werewolf.‚Äù The game is over the moment he says ‚ÄúI was a werewolf.
Male X: I was going to make a bad move too, but I really couldn‚Äôt think of anything in my head. I‚Äôm sorry.
Tachikawa: I know I‚Äôm persistent, but in business, don‚Äôt you ever find yourself in situations where you are the werewolf? For example, when you go to explain something to a customer, you must not lie, but there are times when you have information that you really want to hide.
Nishio: Or rather, the rest of us have to act as if we are confident even though we are not.
Tachikawa: Yes, yes. That‚Äôs right. If I were in the sales department of a large company with normal personnel authority, it would be quite reassuring if I had someone under me who was very strong at wargames.
Male X: I think you may be right.
Tachikawa: This guy can act confident even if he is not, and win the trust of customers. I think that a person who is strong in wargames is basically a plus in terms of business skills.
Nishio: If it is a business skill, it is <a href="./persuasive-power" class="internal alias" data-slug="persuasive-power">persuasive power</a> or <a href="./Ability-to-win-trust" class="internal alias" data-slug="Ability-to-win-trust">Ability to win trust</a>.
Tachikawa: In short, that‚Äôs what I mean.
Nishio: „Äì01:11:13„ÄìI think so.
Tachikawa: Trust is nothing.
Nishio: It is <a href="./subjective" class="internal" data-slug="subjective">subjective</a>. [Trust is subjective.
Tachikawa: Yes, that‚Äôs right. Trust is, moreover, the „Äì01:11:24 fund of trust? „Äì Never. In short, trust is easy to understand if you compare it to a wargame. So it doesn‚Äôt matter if the person is a human or a werewolf. Whether the person is trustworthy or not. Right?
Nishio: Yeah? I‚Äôm a little confused about your question.
Tachikawa: Well, trust means that you can trust Nishio-san, whether he is a villager, a thief, a werewolf, or not, and that you can trust him now.
Nishio: Are you trying to say that Mr. Tachikawa subjectively thinks he seems to be saying the right thing?
Tachikawa: Oh, yes, yes. And, as is true in business, it is quite pleasant to make a positive proposal to the customer, isn‚Äôt it? If you believe in it. If you believe from the bottom of your heart that the introduction of this service will be a plus for your company, then you will be able to make a positive proposal to the customer.
Nishio: So you can say what you sincerely think.
Tachikawa: But we can‚Äôt objectively tell if it is actually a plus for the customer.
Nishio: The rationale is not particularly clear, because no project has a 100% chance of success. I‚Äôm not saying that if this project succeeds, it will be like this „Äì01:12:54„Äì
Tachikawa: In the past, there was that one. „Äì01:12:59„ÄìÊôÇ, one of my bosses was a former Hebelman. He was a guy who made educational videos for Hebel House salesmen. When I asked him how he was going to teach them, he said that he was going to make it so that they would like Hebel House anyway. In other words, we are trying to create salespeople who can sincerely think that this house is really good and sincerely promote it to customers. I see. He said that if they keep on selling without stopping, the customers will find out about it.
Nishio: When you just said that, I felt like a werewolf had been discovered. If you truly believed that you were a villager, you would be suspicious of me for saying such a thing even though you are a villager.
Male X: I thought about doing that. But I don‚Äôt usually do that kind of thing, so I decided not to do it.
Tachikawa: I see. It means that even if you usually pull „Äì01:14:02„Äì you can behave quite well as long as you don‚Äôt think you are a werewolf, right?
Nishio: If you can think of yourself as a villager from the bottom of your heart like this.
Tachikawa: If you put your mind to it.
Man X: That‚Äôs what I mean.
Male Y: I see. It‚Äôs more like becoming.
Tachikawa: No, he said, it‚Äôs really a werewolf.
Male X: Is it like <a href="./play" class="internal" data-slug="play">play</a>?
Nishio: Yes, that‚Äôs right. Maybe it is theater. Maybe it‚Äôs [Theater to act out your confident self.
Tachikawa: What can I say?
Nishio: I think Tachikawa-san talks too much, so I‚Äôd like to hear more from you two.
Male Y: (laughs)
Nishio: How did you like it? Try it?
Male Y: It‚Äôs hard to trust words alone. After all, the possibility of a werewolf/werewolf remained until the end at this time.
Nishio: So it was there in logic.
Male Y: I was definitely left with logic. In the end, it was the way you spoke.
Nishio: Like, confident.
Male Y: The atmosphere and so on compel you to read there. On the contrary, I felt that the person who could create that atmosphere would win in the end. I thought it would have been great if Nishida‚Äôs behavior at the end was a bluff. I thought he was a strong character if he was bluffing. Probably knowing Nishida-san up to now, I decided that it probably wouldn‚Äôt happen. So I thought that what these two guys are saying is right first of all.
Nishio: If I had confidently said that I was the villager, I would have developed a suspicion that these two might be werewolves.
Male Y: Yes, yes. That was probably that one.
Nishio: I think the pattern of these two werewolves tag-teaming each other to deceive each other is rather „Äì01:15:54„Äì
Man X: Well, my undergraduate degree was in the Department of Systems Innovation in the School of Engineering at the University of Tokyo,
Tachikawa: Oh, so it is system creation.
Male X: Yes. The test is like a game theory. It is the famous <a href="./Tit-For-Tat" class="internal alias" data-slug="Tit-For-Tat">Tit For Tat</a> of <a href="./theory-of-games" class="internal alias" data-slug="theory-of-games">theory of games</a>, which is about trust and betrayal, and in infinite trials, the optimal solution is for everyone to cooperate, but when there is a finite solution, they will betray each other.
Nishio: Yeah, yeah.
Man X: I know it sounds naive, but I am a person who believes that in my lifetime, a future or society will be created in which this will be the optimal solution. Therefore, I acknowledge the existence of werewolf-like elements in this world, but I live my life as if I am the one who should destroy them.
Man Y: I see. Excellent, that‚Äôs it.
Tachikawa: Well, I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm talking about. I‚Äôm not sure what you mean by ‚ÄúTFT‚Äù in the game ‚ÄúTit For Tat.
Man X: Yes.
Nishio: Well, we are talking about an ideal world where there are people who betray each other, but everyone stops betraying each other and everyone does good things for each other.
Man X: Well, yes.
Nishio: That community. I would like that to happen, too, but I think of it as a way to create a closed community where the types of people who are already out there who would betray you are not allowed to enter.
Man X: Ahhh.
Nishio: The reason for this is that humans have tried in various patterns to direct all people in the world toward an ideal, but it has not worked.
Man X: Well, yes.
Male Y: Yes, that‚Äôs right.
Nishio: I thought it would be a good idea to start with a small 5-meter radius and create a trustworthy group and expand it while protecting it. I don‚Äôt know why we talked about this. In this sense, playing a wargame and exposing all the deceptions, including the deception, is a way to win trust. If I had intended to cheat when my life was in danger, I wouldn‚Äôt have played like this.
Man X: I‚Äôm sorry. Eh, which one?
Nishio: Well, let‚Äôs say that the person is planning to steal money or something like that, regardless of whether there is any chance or not, it is totally wrong to cheat in a game. You make a character like ‚ÄúI am a person who cannot lie at all,‚Äù and then you cheat at the end of the game.
Male X: Oh, that‚Äôs what I mean.
Nishio: „Äì„Äì 01:18:16
Male X: I think there is also signaling. It is a signaling expression that says, ‚ÄúI am a trustworthy person. I think it‚Äôs interesting that sometimes it has the opposite effect.
Tachikawa: How can signaling be counterproductive?
Male X: Because if you were a werewolf, I think it would be a simple example of how you would be suspicious if you were signaling excessively.
Nishio: I am not a werewolf after all. I am a villager. That‚Äôs actually zero information.
Man X: Well, yes.
Nishio: If you want to put it logically.
Tachikawa: Yes, that‚Äôs right.
Nishio: „Äì01:18:56„ÄìÈ¢ò that both of them are to be executed.
Male X: If you ask me, that‚Äôs not true. I see.
Nishio: What? Is it the part where you have zero information?
Male X: No, so I thought I did that.
Nishio: Ah.
Tachikawa: I think there is a link between this and what is often said in real life about salespeople who are not easily trusted when they give a sales talk.
Nishio: Is it difficult to be trusted?
Tachikawa: Don‚Äôt they say? I wonder what it is.
Nishio: I don‚Äôt know, is that right?
Tachikawa: It‚Äôs like a salesman who is not a good talker but sells a lot of houses.
Nishio: In detail.
Tachikawa: Yes. Tachikawa: Yes. ‚ÄúNo, this is really like this, but‚Ä¶do‚Ä¶do‚Ä¶‚Äù Tachikawa: Yes. And then he would get up on the board and say, ‚ÄúThis is how it is, this is how it is, yes. Yes. Here you go!‚Äù Surprisingly, people like that don‚Äôt get people to buy their products.
Nishio: This commercial is a Japanease commercial of Japanease Takata in my brain.
All: (laughs)
Nishio: I thought it would sell.
Man X: (laughs)
Tachikawa: Japan Net Takata doesn‚Äôt deal much in houses, for example. I think the only items that are easy to sell with that approach are home appliances, and items under 100,000 are easy to sell with that approach. Anything above that requires a different approach.
Nishio: We need to cultivate trust over the long term.
Tachikawa: Otherwise, you would not be able to explain that without selling the Japanet-Takata house. I don‚Äôt know.
Nishio: Well, I think it‚Äôs hard to sell houses because it‚Äôs a business like television where you have to sell to a lot of people and sell a lot.
Man X: For one thing, I guess you could say that I‚Äôm trying to accommodate the customer‚Äôs feeling of being cautious because it‚Äôs a big purchase.
Nishio: Like this person is suspicious.
Tachikawa: Yes, yes. Because there must be some reason why „Äì01:20:35„Äì‚Äòs selling only home appliances using that method, right? That‚Äôs a little „Äì01:20:47„Äì
Male X: This may be a little off topic, but have you ever seen a drama called ‚ÄúIe Selling Onna‚Äù?
Tachikawa: Yes, yes. Keiko Kitagawa‚Äôs?
Man X: Yes, I was watching the previous season. In order to help people who cannot make the decision to buy a house make that decision, they do everything in their power to design a house that is best suited to their lives.
Tachikawa: „Äì01:21:10„Äì
Male X: Yes, yes. In that case, Keiko Kitagawa would say, ‚ÄúThis is like this, this is like this, this is like this, and this is like this. In that case, Keiko Kitagawa would say, ‚ÄúThis is this, this is that, and this is this. It‚Äôs not exactly the same as ‚Äúgetting up on a plank of water,‚Äù but one of the elements that I think might not gain the trust of ‚Äúgetting up on a plank of water‚Äù is that it is not emotionally charged.
Tachikawa: I see.
Man X: I‚Äôm wondering if there is, and if it‚Äôs emotional, then even if it‚Äôs highly logical, it might be highly persuasive because of the emotion that goes along with it. I‚Äôm a slurring kind of person, but I‚Äôm still confident enough to make a sales pitch that will get people to make an important purchase.
Nishio: I see. I see. When I first heard about the lack of trust in the ‚Äústand-up water‚Äù, my first thought was that the other party was too full of information too quickly, and I wondered if there was a sense of discomfort in that.
Male Y: Discomfort.
Tachikawa: Indeed‚Ä¶
Nishio: I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on, but he‚Äôs saying a lot of things, and I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄúWhat the hell is this guy?
Male X: Easy to understand. Easy to understand.
Nishio: Recognizing that there are people in the world who feel that way.
Tachikawa: I think that the number of such people is quite overwhelming. I wondered why everyone follows the same routine. When I think about it, I think people tend to accept things in a certain order. If you say things in the order we are used to, we can easily accept them, but if you break the order we are used to, we don‚Äôt understand it anymore.
Male X: I think there is a lot of that. Well, I agree with some of them. There is no absolute only solution, but I think there are a few patterns that are used with a certain degree of frequency. I think the simplest one is ‚Äúat the beginning‚Äù and ‚Äúat the end.
Nishio: There is a typical pattern to make people feel like buying smoothly.
Tachikawa: It could be anything, but it could also be a mail-order program, or a so-called lead page on the Web, a page that sells the product. It‚Äôs all designed accordingly. The pages are designed in this order from the top to the bottom, with a buy button at the end.
Nishio: So the majority might be inclined to buy it because of that, but the minority closes it by saying weh. The moment they see it, they say, ‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôll buy it! and close the page. They close the page and say, ‚ÄúOh, it looks like an infomercial. Maybe it‚Äôs not so much that it‚Äôs an infomercial-like page that gets people to click the button, but that there‚Äôs a page that‚Äôs not an infomercial that makes that pattern, and it closes the other way. It‚Äôs not good.
Tachikawa: That‚Äôs interesting. People like Mr. Nishio, who think that they will never fall for such things, buy mysterious limited-edition products for 100,000 yen. Recently,
Nishio: What is that these days?
Tachikawa: Have you ever bought such an expensive product?
Nishio: It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm being deceived somehow‚Ä¶
Tachikawa: It‚Äôs not about being deceived or not being deceived. There is some kind of characteristic.
Nishio: Oh, I‚Äôm wondering if there are decisions that are being made to quickly buy expensive things that cost around 100,000 yen.
Tachikawa: No, this is a very rough story. Women like such mail-order programs and often fall for them. But men try their best to avoid them as much as possible, saying, ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt be fooled by such things. But on the other hand, men make surprisingly irrational decisions in completely different areas.
Nishio: Oh, it‚Äôs like you‚Äôre making a lot of irrational decisions.
Tachikawa: That‚Äôs why limited edition figures for men sell like hotcakes. From a woman‚Äôs point of view, why would she buy something like this for 10,000 yen? I don‚Äôt understand the point, but this is good. It doesn‚Äôt matter what the price is. I mean, isn‚Äôt it men who buy AKB CDs in bulk?
Nishio: But that‚Äôs not because the product is female. If I say that, I think there are more „Äì01:25:26„Äìfemale bromides all kinds of bromides done by good-looking men like Kinpuri or something like that.
Tachikawa: Ah.
Male X: There are. There are. There are people like that. There are with different content.
Nishio: With different content.
Tachikawa: I see. Then it‚Äôs not really a gender difference.
Nishio: Maybe there is a gender difference. I have not observed an equal number of female and male fans enough to observe a gender difference. It‚Äôs mainly men. And I agree that a certain percentage of the men I know are paying a lot of money for such things.
Tachikawa: My wife buys five CDs with different jackets of her favorite artists.
Male Y: Seriously?
Tachikawa: It‚Äôs a crazy „Äì01:26:05„Äì when you accuse them of that. TACHIKAWA: ‚ÄúI bought it. I see. This one and this jacket are different.‚Äù And I said, ‚ÄúI see.
Nishio: That‚Äôs how it‚Äôs done there „Äì01:26:17„Äì
Male Y: Coercion.
Nishio: „Äì01:26:21„ÄìMarried couples should divide the amount of money they spend on their hobbies and be indifferent to what each other spends on them.
Tachikawa: That‚Äôs the thing, but I „Äì01:26:30„Äì
All: (laughs)
Nishio: What is this time, doctor, what is this time „Äì01:26:35„Äì
Man X: Oh, but in the decision-making obligation, „Äì01:26:38„ÄìPreference is an incredibly important concept, so it‚Äôs about who wants what in what order. That has a little bit less to do with price.
Tachikawa: So the selection relationship has two perspectives, husband and wife, which makes it difficult to understand what a family is.
Nishio: But when you form a team in a company, for example, you should proceed under the assumption that everyone in the team is different, right?
Tachikawa: Yes, that‚Äôs right.
Nishio: A huge firestorm occurs as a result of assuming that everyone is in line.
Male Y: (laughs)
Tachikawa: This is kind of interesting. It seems to be connected to MOT.
Nishio: In the end, everyone is in a different position. This game of werewolf is the same. You think they are your friends, but there are werewolves in the mix.
Man X: Could this possibly be someone who wants to change jobs and someone who wants to stay at this company?
Nishio: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Tachikawa: I see.
Man X: So you are talking to each other. You are hiding the fact that you are going to change jobs.
Nishio: Yes. I‚Äôm looking for a new job behind the scenes.
Man X: Yes, yes, yes.
Nishio: ‚ÄúWe have to make the company better!‚Äù Like.
Man X: Yes, yes. If you become a stronger wargamer, it will be easier to change jobs.
Nishio: Aside from making it easier to change jobs, well, it makes it easier to make favorable decisions. But, well, when changing jobs, isn‚Äôt it not really necessary that people around you don‚Äôt find out about it?
Man X: No, I don‚Äôt know. My boss‚Äôs boss pretty much covered it up until just before, but then he found out. The calendar kept getting empty.
NISHIO: The schedule is going to be empty. Oh, I can‚Äôt put it in.
Man X: Because I can‚Äôt get in. But well, I‚Äôve lowered the point you mentioned. The part about trying to improve the company.
Nishio: For example, a person who wants to quit the company and a person who wants to stay in the company have different goals, but on the surface they are facing the same direction.
Man X: Yes, yes.</p>
<p>Nishio: I wonder if the situation is similar to a bribe. For example, when developing software, there are people who want to improve the quality of the software and people who want to finish the software project and be released as soon as possible. This is true even in sales, where some sales people just want to sell the software, so it doesn‚Äôt matter if there are bugs or not, just get on with it „Äì01:28:31„Äì„ÄÇ No, of course there are people who think that since they are putting out software, they should not „Äì01:28:37„Äìhere. I think there are people who are seemingly on the same team, seemingly in the same company, seemingly with the same goal, but actually have a different goal behind the scenes.
Man X: Oh, sure.
Tachikawa: Why did you feel that way?
Nishio: The team doesn‚Äôt think „Äì01:28:52„Äì„ÉÅ„Éº„É†„É°„É≥„Éê„Éº.
Tachikawa: Team members.
Nishio: Yes, yes.
Man X: The two concepts that were blurred in my mind have now been quickly separated by Dr. Nishio. Values and purpose are different.
NISHIO: [Values and objectives are different.
Tachikawa: Hmm? By values, do you mean values for whom, and what is the purpose?
Male X: When we say that we should communicate our values when we form a team, the meaning of ‚Äúour objectives are different‚Äù is completely different from the meaning of ‚Äúour goals are different‚Äù and I think it is not good to have different objectives.
Tachikawa: It is better to have the same objectives for all team members, isn‚Äôt it?
Man X: I think it would be better not to include people with different objectives.
Tachikawa: But everyone‚Äôs purpose in a company is different. For example, the most varied are those who seek a sense of fulfillment and satisfaction in their work, and those who seek a sense of purpose in their work, and those who seek a sense of satisfaction in their work.
Male X: That‚Äôs important.
Tachikawa: People who say that work is something you do because you get paid for it. „Äì01:29:44 „Äì
Male X: Values.
Male Y: It‚Äôs the values.
Nishio: After all, the words ‚Äúvalues‚Äù and ‚Äúpurpose‚Äù are used ambiguously now.
Tachikawa: I see.
Nishio: This is where the confusion arises.
Man X: Ahhh.
Nishio: I felt like these three were all here, and I thought, ‚ÄúNo, no, no, which one is the werewolf?
Man X: Are you okay?
Male Y: (laughs)
Nishio: The point is that when we talk about objectives, for example, we all have to have something in place such as completing this software by XXX date, but some people think that after they are released from this project, they will change jobs, some people want money, some people want to complete this software, and some people think they are going to be in the „Äì01:30:23 „Äì because they will complete this software. Some people think that they want money, others think that they want to complete the software, and some people are „Äì01:30:23„Äì because they want to complete the software. What is the goal of each person or individual is different.
Male X: Let‚Äôs see, in hiragana, on the left is what makes you happy and on the right is what you want to do. A little column. What makes you happy?
Tachikawa: What makes you happy? What do you want to do?
Man Y: It‚Äôs not what to do.
Man X: What should be done. I‚Äôd prefer to do what should be done. Let‚Äôs do what should be done.
Tachikawa: This is something. A little bit.
Nishio: Now that‚Äôs a werewolf situation.
Man X: What should we do?
Tachikawa: For me, the idea is probably a little different.
Nishio: These three „Äì01:31:01„Äì
Male Y: Oh, that‚Äôs what I mean. That‚Äôs very interesting.
Tachikawa: What makes you happy? What‚Äôs over here?
Man X: What should we do?
Tachikawa: Should it?</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>Male Y: But I guess we are divided on that. The objective is still the objective, not the value. We talked about consensus, about whether to take Q or C. That‚Äôs the customer‚Äôs matter. That‚Äôs the customer‚Äôs matter. If you don‚Äôt have the customer‚Äôs decision as the axis, you will never be able to satisfy the customer in the end. I think it is better to think that everything is achieved from the customer‚Äôs perspective. I think it is better to think that everything is achieved from the customer‚Äôs point of view.
Nishio: But it‚Äôs just that the team shares one vision that customer matter is important. There are software makers in the world who don‚Äôt think about the customer.
Male Y: That‚Äôs the premise.
Nishio: If we create software that no one else has developed because we are superior in that technology
Man Y: I see.
Nishio: There are actually some ventures that fail badly after they are created, aren‚Äôt there?
Male Y: Oh, I see.
Nishio: Conversely, since there are so many such ventures, books and other such teachings are being written that suggest that it is better to pay more attention to the customer‚Äôs needs.
Male Y: So that‚Äôs how it is.
Tachikawa: Let me tell you a simple story. There are two ways of making service products: one is to focus on the customer‚Äôs needs and wants, and the other is to say, ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt have this, you don‚Äôt know how good this product is.
Man X: Actually, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been thinking. I was waiting to hear about it.
Man Y: What I‚Äôm trying to say is. Male Y: Yeah.
Tachikawa: I think it is both.
Male Y: Honestly, there is.
Tachikawa: So, I don‚Äôt know, but actually, there might be one that is right or the other. People often say that the iPhone is so and so. Because you think, ‚ÄúHow can you use an early model like this? It‚Äôs never going to catch on.
Male Y: But, as I said, it‚Äôs also customer-oriented. When you release an iPhone, the customers are the masters, and since masters have many different ways of thinking, they are able to set their own criteria for judgment because they are customer oriented.
Nishio: Sorry. One more time.
Tachikawa: Axis of judgment?
Male Y: The point is, whether you focus mainly on Q or C, QCT is definitely all about the customer in terms of what the customer has ordered. For example, if we were to release an iPhone and the whole world was our customer base, there would be some customers who want it quickly even if the quality is poor, and there would also be many who want it to be of extremely high quality. When you think that‚Äôs a 50-50 chance that there are a lot of them.
Nishio: I see.
Male Y: The initiative to decide which side to take goes to the sender.
Nishio: I see.
Male Y: It‚Äôs just that.
Nishio: Because our customers are a mass, not a specific individual, we look at them as a distribution and make decisions about where to target within that distribution.
Male Y: Yes.
Nishio: You can also say, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs take our time and make a good product and take it.
Male Y: Yes. That‚Äôs right. That‚Äôs what the gaming industry does.
Nishio: I see.
Male Y: The game industry is very particular, so it doesn‚Äôt matter if we make them wait because we have all kinds of customers. We can do it at our own pace, so it‚Äôs just a matter of making decisions at our house.
Nishio: And the customers who are very goofy about it are okay with this much pi.
Male Y: That‚Äôs what I mean. So in terms of the initial cell phone, you put it out there as if it was normal for it to cut out. At that time, we were at a stage where we could make a judgment either way. We were not in a situation where we had to release a product of absolutely high quality, but rather, we wanted to release a product that could be used by people who were curious about something, so we probably released it first. So, depending on the customer‚Äôs situation, which axis to put on the market will change.
Tachikawa: According to what Mr. Jifuku just said „Äì„Äì01:44:23„ÄìÔºå if the customer waits, then the supplier can make a suggestion as to what part of the product should be cut out. If it‚Äôs a niche, you have to ask more and more.
Male Y: Niche or not. We have to ask. If it is almost definite.
Nishio: „Äì 01:44:45 „Äì
Male Y: If you have a niche but a reasonable clientele, you can probably make a lot of different decisions.
Nishio: Conversely, if the customer „Äì01:44:58„Äì„Åü„Çã, there is no way to hear about it.
Male Y: Yes, yes.
Tachikawa: Indeed. It‚Äôs simple now, but I feel some powerful theory, very powerful. If the customer is a mass, there is a proposal. In other words, if you are trying to make a new phone, you can‚Äôt do it if you are asking the customers.
Nishio: „Äì01:45:22I think there was a discussion about which is better or which is better. But when you are trying to create something new in the world, there is no way you can do it by asking the customers.
Tachikawa: No, I don‚Äôt.
Nishio: That‚Äôs where my values are. Leave other people‚Äôs values aside and use your own values first of all, the prototype „Äì01:45:51„Éñ„É©„Ç§„Éê„É´? How about after you have completed the „Äì? and then you have to go out and say, ‚ÄúHow is it?
Male Y: So that would mean that it is getting closer to being equal there.
Tachikawa: What? What do you mean?
Male Y: Values and objectives.
Tachikawa: Ah.
Nishio: Equal does not mean the same.
Male Y: Yes, yes.
Nishio: You mean they are of equal importance.
Male Y: I mean it will change.
Nishio: Basically, rather than having the same level of importance, the two are orthogonal to each other on the X-axis and the Y-axis‚Ä¶it is not a matter of which is better or anything like that.
Male Y: You mean there is no such thing.
Tachikawa: I see.</p>
