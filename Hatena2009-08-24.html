**1251112946* Consideration of Deadline Driven
I used to think that the reason I was deadline-driven was because of my poor ability to work diligently and habitually. However, I thought that the more significant cause was the poor ability to make choices.
If you prioritize tasks, you should not worry about lower-priority tasks while performing higher-priority tasks, nor should you cut off higher-priority tasks, leaving time necessary to do lower-priority tasks. The meaning of prioritization will be lost.
However, people with low &quot;task discarding ability&quot; often fail to discard tasks that they know are of low priority, and end up accumulating tasks and filling them to the brim.

The advantage of deadlines is that tasks can be discarded in the form of &quot;I want to do this, I want to do that, but I can't make it in time, so I give up.
In a style where you start a task as soon as you think of it, you tend to go down unimportant side roads, but especially when you have a clear goal such as &quot;at least squash that bug by the deadline, print the package, burn 100 CD-Rs, etc.,&quot; you may think, &quot;Oh, this kind of function would be useful. But I don't have time for that right now. But I don't have time for that right now, so I'll just make a note of it and do it later.


It is sluggish to put every single task that comes to mind on a list and consider its priority before executing it, instead of immediately executing it.
The process of completing tasks as they come to mind in a rush has a sense of speed similar to that of quickly defeating enemies that appear one after another in a video game.
But that is like saying, &quot;Writing data to HDD is too slow, so let's not do it, why don't we write it to memory?
It is true that it is faster to just write to memory, but that ends if the power goes out. It also has less capacity. The human brain is the same way: if it is interrupted, it forgets and has little capacity.

*1251115934*Diary of Electronic Work
Since I was able to work more efficiently in a dark cafe, I decided to darken my house as well. I went to Yodobashi to see if I could buy a new light, but I couldn't find one that really struck a chord with me.


I came back and turned on 10 high brightness white LEDs for now. Well, I think this is enough. I heard that bio-light gets very hot, and it would be a nuisance with big lights, but this one doesn't bother me, and it runs on 5V.


I'm still waiting a bit to solder it. If I want to control it with a microcontroller, I will have to connect a Darlington driver or something.


I'm running at 5V with an 8.2 resistor now, so 600mA. looking at the TD62783 datasheet, the rated output current is -500mA. if I solder them all in parallel in the current state, it's no good, but I can change it later if I keep half of them in parallel.


Inspiration. Let's use gooseneck cables as lighting arms!

*1251118341*Diary of Midterm 2.0 Development
One more week and we'll have a framework to play against.

- Goal: To get the
-- Humans can fight third-party or third-party registered AIs.
-- A person without administrative privileges can register an AI
-- Can match AI to AI matches

** Process flow
From the chase because I have completely forgotten myself.
&lt;hr>

start_game -> redirect to /game if it is HTML
&lt;hr>

>||
(r'^api/(?P&lt;format>text|json|html)/start_game/$', 'start_game'),
||&lt;

(I got an error when I specified 'html' as an argument.) I used ? format=html because it is not important that the API is REST-like.
&lt;hr>
I forgot to put the api views in api_views.py. I thought there was no start_game in views, even though it was in urls.py.
&lt;hr>
It was POST start_game but I changed it to GET. I want to start a game with a link. Returns the ID of the newly started game.
&lt;hr>
>||
return HttpResponseRedirect(reverse(views.game, (game_id,)))
__import__() argument 1 must be string, not tuple
||&lt;

Is the use of REVERSE incorrect?
■We'll look into it later.
Checked.
>||
reverse(viewname, urlconf=None, args=None, kwargs=None, current_app=None)
||&lt;
I had to add args. Also, at first I used [game_id] and got angry that it was unhashable, so I changed it to a tuple, but it was just the wrong argument in the first place, so that's OK.

>||
return HttpResponseRedirect(reverse(views.game, args=[game_id]))
||&lt;

It now redirects as expected.
&lt;hr>

http://localhost:8080/saichugen/api/start_game/?format=text
game_89e9e218f919a85cae33e8026fdd518b returned
as expected (positive events)
&lt;hr>

I redirected manually.' NoneType' object has no attribute 'played'

You are trying to show the cards dealt when no one is seated &amp; no cards have been dealt.

TemplateDoesNotExist at /saichugen/game/game_89e9e218f919a85cae33e8026fdd518b/
saichugen/gam_waiting_participants.html
Expected behavior. I haven't made the template yet.

&lt;hr>
add computer players
- List of computer players that can be added
-- What are you going to do?
-- get a list of PLAYERS from the whole and select the PASSIVE ones?
--- display when the last enabled/disabled status was returned
- List of players you can join
&lt;hr>
Oh, I thought it was Model.all(), not Model.objects.all().

&lt;hr>
What kind of value is the type of -Player?
-- why isn't it in the Player class documentation in models.py, explode yourself.

&lt;hr>
Two more hours until the battery runs out.
What needs to be done before the petty deadline?

- Since it is troublesome to test a game with AI mixed in, you can first make it possible to play against others, and then operate the game yourself to test the flow to the end.
- I don't think I can do it in two hours.
-- ■ Test if another player can join
-- ■ Game starts when all three players are present

&lt;hr>
I've been designing the join API this way.
>||
(r'^api/(?P&lt;format>text|json|html)/join/(?P&lt;game_id>.*)/(?P&lt;player_id>.*)/$', 'join'),
||&lt;
for now
>||
(r'^api/html/join/$', 'join_html'),
||&lt;
to accept POST from the form. If this is under api/, and the RATIONALE defined in api_views.py is the view for the general display and api_views.py is the view for the API, then the view that only enlists players and redirects them to the display URL should be in api_views.py should be in api_views.py.

I don't know how to write a form to display a list and make a selection. I don't have a signal, so I'll look into it later.

□ Allow selection of players from a list

For now, I'll just make a decision and move on.
&lt;hr>
Two people can now be seen to be present while two are seated; when a third person is seated, the screen appears after all three are present.
I wish I could see the cards being dealt, but I don't.
It should have been implemented with templatetags.

I don't see any cards being dealt.

No, the cards are dealt and if you check the specific sheet in {{ game.seat_set.0 }}, they are dealt properly, but
It does not appear to be distributed by {{ game.get_played }}.

No, this is the correct behavior. played is the card that the player put on the field, which is empty and correct at the beginning of the game.

What is needed to prevent this mistake from recurring?

I can't think of any, so I'm through.
&lt;hr>
In the meantime, I've put up a link to the seat at a later date.
□ Make it for 3 persons

The view saichugen.views.seat didn't return an HttpResponse object.
As you can imagine, it was unimplemented.
Let's see, what should be displayed on the in-play screen... can we refer to version 1.0 for this?
&lt;hr>
Completion of seat.hand display
□ Make a link so that you can click on it and get a card out.
□ Card spacing is 30px at a fixed point.
&lt;hr>

What must be done next?
□ When you click on a card, the card is put out face down.
□ The existence of the card currently face-down should be indicated
□ If three cards are laid down, proceed with the turn.

18:30. I'm getting hungry. According to the commit log, I committed the &quot;screen when the game hasn't started yet&quot; template at 17:02, so it's already been 1:30 since then, but my battery still has 1:50 left, and when I started the work before the commit, the battery level was 2:30. Hmmm, does the MacBook report less battery? I can work for another hour or two after I eat.

&lt;hr>
For today, let's end with a list of things to do tomorrow.
It took me a while to get started because I had completely forgotten the structure and how far I had come, but I expect to be a bit more productive tomorrow, I hope.

- game
-- □ Allow selection of players to join from a list
--- select, option
--□ I've put up a link to the seats by default for now, for three people.
- seat
--□ Make a link from the seat.hand display so that the card can be clicked on and played.
---□ When you click on a card, the card is put out face down.
---□ The presence of the card currently face-down should be indicated
---□ If three cards are laid down, proceed with the turn.
--□ (unimportant) cards are spaced 30px apart by default.
&lt;/body>
