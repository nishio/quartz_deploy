<p>It is especially useful to look at a catalog of the various ways of earning compensation, especially for those who have only experienced the position of a company employee and cannot think of any other way of earning compensation other than employment, or for students who have no experience earning money and only have ideas like, ‚ÄúCan I just put up an ad for the time being?‚Äù It is beneficial to catalog and look at the wide variety of ways to receive compensation.</p>

<p>contracting</p>
<ul>
<li>The contractor promises to complete the product and the client pays for the results</li>
<li>Promises to complete software</li>
<li>Commitment to do a Proof of Concept and submit a report</li>
<li>I‚Äôm promising to complete it:
<ul>
<li>The recipient cannot break the contract.</li>
<li>The receiving party is liable for defects. Even if the receiving party is not clearly at fault for a defect, the ordering party may demand correction or compensation for damages.</li>
<li>The definition of ‚Äúcompletion‚Äù (requirements definition) must be clear in advance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The ordering party does not have the right to give orders, so they are free to decide how to proceed with the work.</li>
<li>A person who is good with a camera gets paid for taking and giving a picture of a request ‚Äútake a picture of this‚Äù.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quasi-delegation (‚Äúdelegation‚Äù is used only for legal actions by attorneys and others)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A quasi-commission contract in which the mandator entrusts a designee to perform an act and the designee accepts the mandator‚Äôs consent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the same time, you enter into a contract to receive compensation for that quasi-consignment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unlike contracting, there is no goal of ‚Äúcompletion,‚Äù so it is common to bill for a period of time</p>
<ul>
<li>Charging by the hour (Visa Sukuk)</li>
<li>You get paid for one meeting.</li>
<li>Sometimes a continuous contract at how much per month.
<ul>
<li>Contract says I will attend two one-hour meetings per month.</li>
<li>Contracts for up to 10 hours of consultation per month.</li>
<li>Participate in the chat and comment on the consultation on a best-effort basis.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Example of implementation and compensation for live coding during 3 meetings</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.joyzo.co.jp/service/system39" class="external">System 39 | Joizo Corporation<svg aria-hidden="true" class="external-icon" style="max-width:0.8em;max-height:0.8em;" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><path d="M320 0H288V64h32 82.7L201.4 265.4 178.7 288 224 333.3l22.6-22.6L448 109.3V192v32h64V192 32 0H480 320zM32 32H0V64 480v32H32 456h32V480 352 320H424v32 96H64V96h96 32V32H160 32z"></path></svg></a></li>
<li>Software development is probably quasi-commissioned since it is done through meetings without the need to create specifications in advance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>I imagine this is often the case when the product is not tangible (like consulting)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do they prove that they ‚Äúdid the deed?‚Äù</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the difference between contracting and contracting if you are contracting for deliverables that can eventually be verified?</li>
<li>It appears that quasi-contracts should not require deliverables.</li>
<li>A case in which a report is promised to be delivered is a contractual agreement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ordering party has a duty of care to take good care of the order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The client does not have the right to command and control.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Examples of quasi-consignment for results</p>
<ul>
<li>Quasi-contracting with designers and other specialized technicians at a ‚Äúfee per hour of work‚Äù.</li>
<li>Can you trace this for me?‚Äù I want you to update this page,‚Äù etc., asking for specific results.</li>
<li>Each month, you receive an invoice summarizing the month‚Äôs operation and pay it.</li>
<li>They want results, but those results are not what is written in the contract.</li>
<li>Can you do this for me?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, I can‚Äôt‚Äù can happen.
<ul>
<li>Since the recipient is not responsible for completion, it is still a quasi-contract under the law.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A state in which the designer accepts the act of ‚Äúanswering miscellaneous consultations from non-designers‚Äù.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>revenue sharing</p>
<ul>
<li>Contracts that say, ‚ÄúI get a percentage of sales.‚Äù</li>
<li>Common in book publishing contracts
<ul>
<li>Receive 10% of sales as so-called ‚Äúroyalties</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Affiliate Income
<ul>
<li>Receive a referral fee of 3% of sales when a product is sold by introducing it on your blog, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Can be used in software development.</li>
<li>In some cases, joint ventures are created when research is a collaboration between companies.</li>
<li>There needs to be an audit clause to make sure sales are being reported correctly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Receive in kind, not in money.</p>
<ul>
<li>The famous stock option to receive compensation for labor in the form of the ‚Äúright to buy stock‚Äù.</li>
<li>Cases where the payer does not have sufficient funds to pay salaries in cash</li>
<li>Cases where people who find it inconvenient to receive in cash receive in kind.
<ul>
<li>Goods, rights to use the facilities, car fees, etc.</li>

<p>Make a donation</p>
<ul>
<li>coinage</li>
<li>There are real music and games that have a type of billing that allows users to donate any amount they want.
<ul>
<li>I wonder if there‚Äôs a way to do that if you have a dedicated fan base.</li>
</ul>

<li>We get donations from companies that want to say they are involved in some kind of public interest activity and donate to such activities.</li>

<p>Reference: Typical contracts in the Civil Code (13 types)</p>
<ul>
<li>Gift: A contract to give property to the other party without compensation.</li>
<li>Contract: A contract in which the contractor promises to complete the work and the client pays compensation for the results of that work.</li>
<li>Exchange: a contract in which the parties transfer property rights ‚Äúother than money ownership‚Äù to each other.</li>
<li>Sale: A contract whereby one party, the seller, transfers property rights and the other party, the buyer, pays for them.</li>
<li>Loan for consumption: A contract formed when one party, the borrower, receives money or other things from the other party, the lender, promising to return the same thing in kind, quality and quantity. (A contract is a contract with consideration when the borrower pays interest, and a contract without consideration when the borrower pays no interest.)</li>
<li>Lease: A contract formed when one party promises to allow the other party to use and profit from a certain thing and the other party promises to pay wages for this use and profit.</li>
<li>Loan for use: A contract formed when the borrower, one of the parties, promises to return a certain thing after using and profiting from it without compensation and receives it from the lender, the other party.

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>incomplete</p>
<ul>
<li>When you don‚Äôt get paid, you create a company, pay bills from it, and accumulate them in that company (you don‚Äôt pay yourself a salary from that company).</li>
</ul>
