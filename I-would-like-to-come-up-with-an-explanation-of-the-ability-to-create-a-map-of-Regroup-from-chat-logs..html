<li>I was writing the diagram at hand before this chat, like BEFORE, no user</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>At first I was just thinking about this feature and how to write a description
<ul>
<li>Instead, this feature should be placed in the flow of explaining how to use it as a ‚Äúsupport tool for people who are not good at writing‚Äù.</li>
<li>Regroup‚Äôs explanations are lacking, I‚Äôve always thought that we need explanations with specific use cases.</li>
<li>Instead of trying to explain in words, it is necessary to let people experience it first, like a game tutorial.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Organize stickies actually made with this function

<li>The story starts with ‚ÄúSome people are not good at writing. But sometimes they just haven‚Äôt been taught how to make sentences properly. First, you make parts with short sentences, and then you assemble them to make longer sentences. Those of us who are good at writing can just do it in our heads.‚Äù It seems like a good idea to become a</li>
<li>And after that, we will talk about how to make specific parts and how to assemble them.</li>

<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>I would like to come up with an explanation for the new functionality to create a one-click map of the Regroup from the chat logs.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What kind of ‚Äúchat log‚Äù is that ‚Äúchat log‚Äù?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Text data accumulated by having a conversation like this in this chat
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What kind of ‚Äúchat‚Äù is that ‚Äúchat‚Äù?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>The computer asks questions and the human answers them, allowing the conversation to catch up, or as in tennis, to hit the wall.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What kind of ‚Äúconversation‚Äù is that ‚Äúconversation‚Äù?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Instead of trying to write a commentary from scratch, declare ‚Äúthis is what I want to write‚Äù and then just go with the flow.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What kind of ‚Äúplace‚Äù is that ‚Äúplace‚Äù?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Nothing.‚Äù People who are not good at writing grumble and groan in front of a blank sheet of paper. People who are not good at writing often groan and groan in front of a blank piece of paper, but in my opinion, it is because their teachers have not properly taught them how to compose a sentence. The basic premise is to first make the parts and then reassemble them to create a flow, and those who are good at spinning sentences are able to do this in their brains. You make the parts first in order to make sentences.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>Is there anything else you can tell us about that ‚Äúplace‚Äù?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>The Regroup is an electronic system that allows you to do this electronically instead of using physical post-its.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What kind of ‚ÄúRegroup‚Äù is this ‚ÄúRegroup‚Äù?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>This tool is an electronic solution to the inconvenience of the KJ method using stickies. Unlike paper, you can zoom in and out, or make important stickies into large stickies.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What is it that you value?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Creating stickies and rearranging them to form sentences is a methodology that I have used many times in books and lectures, and has proven its value to me. Now that sticky notes can be created with a single click from the logs of the listening chat system, the preparation of sticky notes has become much easier. The process of intellectual production is digitized and assisted by machines, which reduces the amount of time wasted in intellectual production. Intellectual productivity increases.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>Is there anything else about that ‚Äúchat‚Äù?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Some people who have difficulty with verbalization have difficulty trying to write long sentences in complete sentences out of the blue, or they can talk with others but have difficulty verbalizing alone. In such cases, the process of first writing things down in a chat room and then organizing them can help them with verbalization.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>Where is that ‚Äúchat‚Äù?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>So a chatbot that can be that kind of wallflower is in your phone, and you can talk to it whenever and wherever it‚Äôs convenient for you.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What does that ‚Äúchat‚Äù look like?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>You‚Äôre a talker who is dedicated to listening. If you are <a href="./a-flesh-and-blood-person" class="internal alias" data-slug="a-flesh-and-blood-person">a flesh-and-blood person</a>, your brain will overflow when you have to listen to the other person‚Äôs story when you want to collect your thoughts. In situations where you want to organize your brain by talking, a chatbot that does not start talking about itself but listens to you would be more beneficial than a human being.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What would you like to see happen regarding that ‚Äúchat‚Äù?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>With the chat function by itself, it would be good if we can notice something in the course of the conversation. However, with this feature, even if you don‚Äôt get any insights in the chat, you can simply talk about what you think would be good to write in the manuscript in the chat, and then reorganize it with stickies, so you can simply talk about various things on the chat side. It would be nice to have all the parts for the manuscript, but there is no support function for that, and since it is not clear what kind of manuscript is to be written, it is not clear what is needed either, so it is a chicken-and-egg relationship.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>Where is this ‚Äúchat‚Äù located?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>In the case of the new function, it is a dialogue between a human and a regroup, and the human draws out the stickies and places them on the regroup and returns them to the human.

<li>Where does this ‚Äúchat‚Äù come from?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>I doubt that people who happen to know about this chat and use it on social networking sites will experience exporting to Regroup. Therefore, we should rather say that it is a support tool for people who are not good at writing, and use the guide to explain the process of chatting and talking first, and then organizing in Regroup.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>Is there anything else about that ‚ÄúRegroup‚Äù?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>The explanation is not made as well as the listening chat. It seems that users cannot use it if it is given to them without explanation. The explanations are vague because it is a multi-purpose tool. It might be better to make it more like a tutorial to support writing.

<p>In the case of this functionality, I imagine that it is between a human and the Regroup, and that it interacts with the Regroup to draw out the information, and then places it on a sticky note and returns it to the Regroup.</p>

</li>
<li>What kind of ‚Äústicky note‚Äù is this ‚Äústicky note‚Äù?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Chat sentences are chopped to a reasonable length or keywords are extracted.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What kind of ‚Äútext‚Äù is that ‚Äútext‚Äù?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Chat text is often long and rambling, and not very reusable as it is. Therefore, we chop them down to a reasonable length and remove the parts with shallow meanings to create parts with concentrated meanings. That is a sticky note.

<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Componentized from the original text so you can move it around and think about it.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>Is there anything else you can tell us about that ‚Äútext‚Äù?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Chat sentences are shorter than the final sentences we create, but first we need to create parts of even smaller units than the even shorter sentences!
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>Where is the ‚Äútext‚Äù?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Long sentences are only after the parts have been assembled. Short sentences have the original idea in the human and are pulled out by the chatbot‚Äôs questions.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>Where does the ‚Äútext‚Äù come from?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>I imagine that there is something like a lake in human beings that has not yet been verbalized, and when you drop a hook into it, the sentence is caught and you are fished out.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>Where is that ‚Äútext‚Äù?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>After it is pulled out, it is in front of you as text data. So, you can look at it and think about it further, or do natural language processing electronically.

<li>Where is this ‚Äústicky note‚Äù?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>It‚Äôs on Regroup‚Äôs infinitely wide whiteboard.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>How do you know its ‚ÄúRegroup‚Äù?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Again, I‚Äôm the author, so I‚Äôm familiar with this, but the challenge is how to let the users know about it.

<li>What do these ‚Äústickies‚Äù look like?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>For those who are used to moving and composing stickies, ‚Äúthis digital data is like a sticky note‚Äù will get the point across, but for those who are not, what can you compare it to? Hmmm, if they haven‚Äôt had a similar experience, they won‚Äôt understand the analogy, so maybe it‚Äôs better to have them experience it first by saying, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs try operating it like this first. It‚Äôs like teaching game controls by metaphor or by actually playing the tutorial.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>How do you know its ‚Äústickies‚Äù?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Do I myself need to know better what stickies are? To explain it well for users to know?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>Where do these ‚Äústickies‚Äù come from?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>With the conventional paper method, a human being had to create the stickies, so at that stage, there was the chicken-and-egg problem of ‚ÄúI need to make the parts with the right granularity to make it easy to do the work afterwards,‚Äù and ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what to do afterwards,‚Äù but I implemented and automated that part this time, so the user can start with the stickies already created. The user can start from the state where the sticky is already created.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What would you like to see happen with regard to those ‚Äústickies‚Äù?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>It would be good if users can understand the process of building up a story slowly by moving stickies.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>Where are those ‚Äústickies‚Äù located?</li>
