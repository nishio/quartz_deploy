I guess the scientific term is “influencing substance,” which is harmful when used in a messy way, and beneficial when used delicately.
People think it is harmful because it was used in the past in a miscellaneous way and caused harm, but this is probably a temporary belief in its long history.</p>

<li>After the word “beneficial” was introduced, its effect was to differentiate the earlier “harmful” into “harmful” and “harmful.”</li>

Even if one could memorize the contents of a book and reproduce them verbatim, this would only be duplicating information that has been verbalized in the past.
Understanding the content of a book is before you do something, what is to be done by doing it.
It is to be able to predict what will happen in the future.
The degree of understanding is measured not by how correctly one can reproduce past information, but by how correctly one can predict future information.</p>

<ul>
<li>In this example, the writing was started in a text editor, chopped into Kozaneba, and placed in two dimensions</li>
<li>The block of “before doing something ~” was written once and then truncated because “this branch is unbalancedly large in expressing the contrasting structure of the two elements.”

The picture was created to better express “when the next word comes up, but it’s not connected to what I’ve written so far.”</p>

Supplement this picture with words</p>
<ul>
<li>1: Thinks that he/she can express his/her thoughts in sentences (one dimensional words, a row of symbols connected in a line)</li>
<li>2: When it comes time to start writing, you realize it doesn’t connect well.</li>

<ul>
<li>3A: Find the connecting words</li>
<li>3B: Put off connecting them and proceed to write out the other parts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The fact that you started out thinking that you could smoothly write out what you were thinking in one-dimensional language (1), but in fact you could not (2), clearly shows that you did not have a very clear grasp of the structure of what you wanted to say. Therefore, I think that 3A, which ignores this and tries to write it out as a one-dimensional language as originally planned, is an illogical choice.</p>
<p>t4
supplement the context
I talked about the writing process with someone who does not do two-dimensional placement of detailed fragments.
The person made a distinction between “moyamoya <span>→</span> sentence” and “moyamoya <span>→</span> fragment”.
However, Nishio felt that there was no clear boundary between the two.
The reason why there are no boundaries is that when we start out with the intention of being able to write out a sentence that can stand alone, but observe the fact that it does not come out smoothly, we let go of the constraint to “produce symbols connected in a row” and fall back into the mode of writing out fragments.</p>
<p>t5
I’ve been thinking about why there are no boundaries, because when I start with the intention of being able to write out a sentence that can stand alone, but observe the fact that it doesn’t come out smoothly, I let go of the constraint to “produce symbols connected in a row” and fall back to the mode of writing out fragments.
After thinking about why there are no boundaries, I realized that I often choose to do things the 3B way.
Even if you start with the intention of writing out a sentence that can stand alone, once you observe that it does not come out smoothly, you let go of the constraint of “producing symbols connected in a line” and fall back to the mode of writing out fragments, so there is no boundary between “writing a sentence or writing a fragment.</p>

Look back and see the initial fragment</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Started out thinking I could smoothly write down what I was thinking in one-dimensional words (1), but in reality I could not smoothly write it down (2).
Since this observation reveals that I did not have a very clear grasp of the structure of what I wanted to say, I think that 3A is an ill-advised choice to ignore it and write it out as originally planned as one-dimensional language### connected symbol sequence
.
It is better to let go of the constraint that “it must be connected” and write out first the whole of what you were going to say. As you continue to write out and the symbols ahead become clearer, the “connection” may become clear after the fact by association with the symbols</p>
<p>Comment</p>
<ul>
<li>In this example, I initially wrote it out thinking it could be expressed in one dimensional text, but after getting stuck and expressing it in fragments, I made the choice to express it in pictures</li>
<li>Some coherent text was output to explain the picture.</li>
<li>I compared that text with the fragments I had initially written out and discovered what I had missed.</li>
