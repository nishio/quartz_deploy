*1378024177*Motivational Systems 5000-user milestone entry
Our &lt;a href='http://www.nhiro.org/yaruki/'>question-and-answer system&lt;/a>, which has been quietly operating, has just recently surpassed 5,000 users. It seems that 2,000 people have been motivated by this system, which makes it worthwhile.

By the way, this system is designed so that if the respondent cannot find an appropriate answer among the prepared answers, he or she is asked, &quot;Why do you think you are unmotivated?&quot; and ask them to look at their feelings again. When this much data is collected, we can see common patterns in the free-answer responses. In commemoration of the 5000th user milestone, we have picked up a few of them and will explain them here.

** Self-deprecating labeling

Why do you think you are unmotivated?&quot; some people give the following kinds of answers: &quot;Because I'm lazy,&quot; &quot;Because I'm a bum,&quot; &quot;Because I'm lazy,&quot; &quot;Because I'm a useless person,&quot; or &quot;Because I'll never be able to do a full-fledged job.

If you label yourself with a negative label such as &quot;bad person,&quot; you will think, &quot;I'm a bad person. That's why I'm not motivated. See, I couldn't get motivated. I'm a bad person after all.

If you think calmly about the past, there are things that went well and things that didn't go well, but for some reason you focus only on the things that didn't go well, and then you make the generalization that &quot;things have always gone wrong, so they will always go wrong in the future,&quot; and you torment yourself with these self-invented thoughts. This is a self-destructive state in which we torment ourselves with the thoughts we have created.

To break out of this loop, it is important to first realize that you are now making false assumptions.

If you answered, &quot;Because you can't do a full-fledged job forever,&quot; I am sure that you have a boss around you who labels you as &quot;You can't do a full-fledged job forever. But that person is neither God nor has the ability to predict your future. You should not take that person's words too seriously.


** &quot;Should&quot; thinking

This group can be further divided into three categories.
- The &quot;not worth it&quot; type, where &quot;it's not worth it,&quot; &quot;I'm not getting anything out of it,&quot; and &quot;I don't see the need to do it right now.&quot;
- &quot;I don't want to do it,&quot; &quot;I have a fundamental feeling that I don't want to do it,&quot; &quot;I don't want to do it,&quot; &quot;I don't want to do it,&quot; &quot;I think about it.
- The &quot;unattainable&quot; type, where &quot;it's unattainable in the first place,&quot; &quot;I don't feel like I can do it,&quot; and &quot;I'm doing something I can't do.&quot;

If it's not worth doing, why not do it? If I don't want to do it, why not do it? If we can't accomplish it, why not do it?

Some of you may get angry when I naively ask you this question. But you think you &quot;should&quot; or &quot;must&quot; do it, don't you? Why is that? Is it really the right thing to do?


** &quot;All or nothing&quot; thinking

Some respondents said they were &quot;afraid of failure,&quot; &quot;want to make it perfect but don't have the capacity,&quot; &quot;have a hard time hurting myself if I fail,&quot; &quot;won't be able to recover if I fail,&quot; and &quot;don't know if I'll get what I want for sure even if I complete it.&quot;

I want to be perfect. I want to be sure of success. If I can't be sure of success, I don't want to do it. This thinking is unrealistic. Most things in the world are not perfect, and there is no surefire way to succeed. But if you think that only what is perfect and certain is good, and everything else is bad, then everything else is bad. Are your demands too high?


** I have nothing I want to do.

Some respondents said, &quot;I have no goals,&quot; &quot;I can't have dreams,&quot; &quot;I can't find anything I want to do,&quot; and &quot;I really want to play.&quot;

Hmmm, then I think you should play with it. Then why not? Because someone said that everyone *should* work hard to achieve their dreams and goals? If you would rather have heartache than take such an opinion to heart, why not just ignore it?

One might argue against such an assertion, &quot;No, I can't live if I play, I have to earn a living. Then the goal is &quot;to earn a living,&quot; right? Others may say that you don't have a dream, but &quot;you have to have a dream&quot; is their selfish belief, and there is no need for you to follow their belief.


** Type where the body is screaming

I'm stressed to death,&quot; &quot;I'm heavy,&quot; &quot;I'm tired,&quot; &quot;I'm sleepy...&quot;

You should take a break. Especially you who came from news sites, Hatena Bookmark, Gunosy, etc. Is reading those pages really necessary for you right now? Is it something that you have to continue to do even though you feel pain in your body?


** It's this system that keeps me unmotivated.

'It's your fault because your advice isn't accurate, and I know this advice is pointless.'

Eh, that's not right. You used this system because you were unmotivated. It is strange that using the system is the cause of your lack of motivation when &quot;lack of motivation&quot; came first in time. It's like saying that an earthquake hit and a sacred tree fell down and you say, &quot;The earthquake hit because the sacred tree fell down.

Contrary to this, several people commented that they were motivated from the get-go... er, I guess you could say that they were motivated, but they spent their time using services to motivate themselves...

Both of you seem to be very tired and should rest.


** Regarding time

Some said they were not motivated because they &quot;still have time&quot; and others said they &quot;don't have time&quot; or are &quot;too busy&quot;. Quite the opposite.

It seems that setting a reasonable deadline is still necessary to motivate people. If you have lots of time, you could try setting yourself a middle deadline. For example, if you have a report due in three weeks, rather than spending the three weeks thinking, &quot;I have to do this report,&quot; and looking at relevant information, it is better to spend one hour writing a report of the worst possible quality without doing any preliminary research, and then spend the next three weeks thinking, &quot;What information do I need to make this report of decent quality? The total amount of time and stress is less if you spend three weeks thinking, &quot;What information do I need to make this a decent quality report?


** I can't think straight.

I recommend writing it down on paper. In creating this article, I also wrote down a lot of feedback once on a sticky note and organized it before writing it.


** What is research?

This comment is not a group, but it caught my eye and I would like to answer it.

I bet you think, &quot;I need to do research,&quot; and after using this system, you realize that the cause of your lack of motivation is, when you get right down to it, &quot;What is research?&quot; You have to do research,&quot; you think. I think you are having trouble understanding what &quot;research&quot; means.

What is research? is the reason for your lack of motivation, the next thing to do is to ask yourself, &quot;How can I answer the question, 'What is research? If you find that the reason for your lack of motivation is that you cannot answer the question, &quot;What is research? For example, you can consult with your advisor or senior members of your laboratory, or if you don't like to ask in words, you can read books that might have something to do with research.

In this way, I think this is what research is all about: figuring out what the problem is, thinking about what can be done to solve the problem, doing it, and learning from the process. I observe myself, the object of my research, and think about how I can solve the problem of &quot;not being motivated&quot;. I was interested in whether the results of this research could be applied only to myself or to other people, so I created this system and experimented with it. As a result, we found that we could solve the problems of 2,000 out of 5,000 people. What is needed to solve the remaining 60% of problems is a new problem that I would like to consider in the future.

Here is a book that talks about how &quot;all-or-nothing thinking&quot; and &quot;labeling&quot; are types of &quot;cognitive distortions&quot; that are common in people who feel depressed (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/4791102061/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie= UTF8&amp;camp=247&amp;creative=7399&amp;creativeASIN=4791102061&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=nishiohirokaz-22&quot;>Good-bye, Bad Mood - Learn to Overcome Depression on Your Own&lt;/a>) I'm sure you can read about it in the book. However, it is over 700 pages long, and I am afraid that if someone who is really depressed buys it, he/she will lose heart because of the thickness of the book...

Surprisingly close to cognitive therapy is the Buddhist-derived &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/4093881065/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=247&amp;creative=7399&amp; creativeASIN=4093881065&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=nishiohirokaz-22&quot;>The Practice of Not Thinking&lt;/a>. This one is thin and easy to read.
