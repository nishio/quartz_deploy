In the new implementation, we felt that the grouping was not good as it is now, and that the current grouping was not the core of the functionality, so we considered giving it a different name.

<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>At first, it was a system of writing out and making stickies with this tool, and grouping and bundling them, with the image of the KJ method.

<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>Is there anything else you can tell us about that “stationery”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>It needs to be stable and usable. Right now the pen function of Regroup is broken, so to speak, and the pen is left out of ink, which is not good. For stress-free use, it must be a small number of well-maintained stationery.

<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Let’s write it down and organize it.
