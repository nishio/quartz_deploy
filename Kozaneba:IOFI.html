<blockquote>
<p>It is true that the relationship between symbols and perceived meanings is more fundamental than logic, since meanings and logical patterns are created only in the interaction between symbols and perceived meanings. Therefore, logic is secondary and only works after the formation of meaning.

<p>It can be shown that one is always matching a very specific, well-defined felt meaning, and that the variety of possible symbolic meanings for that felt meaning is quite the opposite of arbitrary.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fundamental empiricism would not assume (think) any kind of logical pattern prior to the creation of logical patterns. Fundamental empiricism would not read any conceptual patterns into the preconceptual experience process. (This is because they themselves were created by the interaction of symbols and experience processes.) It would retain well formed and defined concepts and logical deductions, but it would not confuse these with the actual experienced processes at work in the creation of new meanings.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>How do you determine the meaning that comes to your mind when you see this</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is it determined by its similarity to the meaning of the rose?‚Äù</p>
<ul>
<li>Really?</li>
<li>Roses and humans are different.</li>
<li>In what sense are they similar?</li>
<li>There could be a lot of words for this.
<ul>
<li>Or, ‚ÄúLively and blooming.‚Äù</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When you first saw ‚Äúmy lover is like a red, red rose‚Äù, did you understand the meaning after the explanation of this similarity came to mind?
<ul>
<li>I‚Äôm sure he didn‚Äôt explicitly think about it.</li>
<li>The ‚Äúsimilarity‚Äù did not come first.
<ul>
<li>The experiencing process of combining the words ‚Äúlover‚Äù and ‚Äúrose‚Äù to refer to the same thing was first, from which the similarity was derived a posteriori.</li>

</li>
<li>Distinction between concept and perceived meaning
<ul>
<li>A clear distinction must be made between concepts (uniquely specified (logical) concepts) and the functioning of felt meaning.</li>
<li>One felt meaning can be symbolized in many ways (COMPREHENSION)
<ul>
<li>Each of these uniquely speccified concepts is not equivalent.</li>
<li>Even if each of the functioning of felt meaning ‚Äúfits‚Äù, it does not mean that the output symbols are logically identical in meaning.</li>
<li>This ‚Äúfit‚Äù can be determined by direct matching.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The function of perceived meaning determines
<ul>
<li>The ‚Äúcreation of meaning‚Äù here is
<ul>
<li>It is not ‚Äúcreation from nothing.‚Äù</li>
<li>Nor is it ‚Äúthe creation of anything arbitrary.‚Äù</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Each functional relationship has a different degree of imagination.
<ul>
<li>In METAPHOR and CIRCUMLOCUTION the felt meaning itself is created</li>
<li>In COMPREHENSION and RELEVANCE, the given felt meaning is modified by the symbols
<ul>
<li>It does not create new meaning.</li>
<li>However, this given felt meaning is somehow directly referred to, so the whole is involved in the creation of a new meaning.</li>

<p>Two Dangers</p>

<p>Thus, there is a twin danger: either (1) we will take one of these functional relationships as crucial and ignore the fact that felt meaning functions in others
, or (2) we will speak of felt meaning as an occurrence altogether apart from such relationships with symbols, which will be quite a questionable thing to talk about.
We may assume one of these functional relationships to be definitive and ignore the fact that the perceived meaning is at work in the other.</p>

We have used this structure in our discussion of the units of experience. By doing so, we have ‚Äústructured experience.</p>
<ul>
<li>Structure:schema, Structure:schematize</li>
<li>We wanted to discuss without symbolizing one particular one, so we provided some schemes
<ul>
<li>(When discussing differentiation, instead of using only one specific symbol, ‚Äúdifferentiation,‚Äù a symbol used within the existing structure of philosophy, I pointed to the ‚Äúfelt meaning‚Äù I wanted to point to with a number of different symbols used within a number of different structures.)</li>
<li>It allowed me to say what I wanted to say.</li>
<li>Each formula (fomulation) had a philosophical meaning, but there was no obligation to accept it.</li>
<li>I wasn‚Äôt obligated to, but I tried not to break it if at all possible‚Ä¶ I collated it directly and chose the word that fit best.</li>
<li>(8) Details are discussed in Chapter 6, Section A.7. Called ‚Äúfunctional equivalence.
<ul>
<li>Equivalent terms can be REFERRED and FUNCTIONAL to the same experience X</li>
<li>X is function performed by experience, which is symbolized in a variety of ways</li>

</li>
<li>At this stage, the term ‚Äúmulti-schematic‚Äù may seem very abstract, but that is because it does not give concrete examples of schemas, and ‚Äútemporal schemas,‚Äù ‚Äúphysical schemas,‚Äù and ‚Äúprocess schemas‚Äù come later.</li>
<li>Diverse schemas can occur. The experience process is not structured by any one schema.

<p>SPECIFICATION, referring to both ‚Äúspecifying‚Äù and ‚Äúwhat results from specifying‚Äù.
Here, it‚Äôs the ‚Äúresults obtained‚Äù. Because the verb results modifies it.
In the translation, you wrote ‚ÄúI put quotation marks around ‚Äúwere‚Äù to mean ~‚Äù, but the ‚Äúwere‚Äù is gone in the translation.
Ah, we‚Äôre talking about given and other, but the other in the original text has been dropped from the translation!
So, the same symbol is used to express a connection, but the translator misses the symbol, so the connection is not connected.
Ha - progress in understanding the phenomenon of ‚Äúunderstanding‚Äù.</p>
<p>Definition of ‚ÄúAspects of Experience</p>
<ul>
<li>Aspect of experience</li>
<li>The term ‚Äúaspects of experience‚Äù is used to refer to the objects that result when experience is SPECIFIED through creative symbolism.</li>
<li>Creative symbolization creates=specifies certain ‚Äúaspects (aspects)‚Äù of ‚Äúfuzzy experiences‚Äù that are myriad and multi-scheme.</li>
<li>At this time, aspects are created, depending not only on the experience X that is the focus of attention, but also on other experiences Y, Z‚Ä¶ At this time, aspects of Y, Z as well as experience X are created.</li>
<li>One can always explain (creatively specify) which other experiences besides experience X were ‚Äúincluded‚Äù in this ‚Äúcreation of aspects‚Äù. If the ‚Äúcreation of aspects‚Äù has already taken place, then this explanation is COMPREHENSION.</li>
<li>I say included and ‚Äúwas‚Äù here because it is in the past. This explanation is timed to COMPREHENSION (and COMPREHENSION takes place after the ‚Äúcreation of aspects‚Äù), so the ‚Äúaspects‚Äù are ‚Äúalready there‚Äù at that time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Experience includes time.</p>
<ul>
<li>An experience that has not been specified has no unit, the unit is specified at the time it is specified, and at the same time the schema-like relationship is specified.</li>
<li>The same can be said about time.</li>
<li>Temporal pre- and post-relationships and moments are a type of scheme and have no relationship in the time scheme until they are identified</li>
<li>For example, there is ‚Äúan experience X‚Äù, then there is ‚Äúan experience Y‚Äù, and then you look back from Y and say that something Z was ‚Äúalready there in X‚Äù.
<ul>
<li>This was first,‚Äù explains more than just ‚Äúthis.‚Äù</li>
</ul>

Engrave unintelligible sentences in Kozaneba
Each symbol may or may not lead to a felt sense.
Stay large, don‚Äôt connect.
Smaller.
In places, there are symbols tied to felt sense.</p>
<ul>
<li>Felt Sense‚Äù and ‚ÄúFelt Meaning‚Äù do just that.</li>
<li>It comes in the form of ‚Äúfelt meaning‚Äù in the book, which I feel is felt sense.
Symbols cannot work creatively unless they are connected to experienced meaning</li>
<li>Let‚Äôs not talk about the Chinese room.
I know what each word means, but I don‚Äôt know what it means as a whole.</li>
<li>What I do in Kozaneba at this point is to write down the adjacency of a symbol to other symbols, or the relationship of ‚ÄúA and B are the same‚Äù, etc., and create the meaning felt by the CIRCUMLOCUTION!
An important word was left out in the translation process.</li>
</ul>
<p>I woke up and read a little more, and I‚Äôm feeling like translation is a tough job.
The author‚Äôs own thoughts (felt meaning) written in non-parallel symbols,
When words are re-expressed in another language that does not have a one-to-one correspondence
Naturally, it cannot be translated mechanically by looking only at the symbols.
Ideally, we need to ‚Äúreproduce the exact meaning that was felt in the author‚Äôs mind, and then express it accurately in Japanese.
Difficult to verify if the ‚Äúfelt meaning‚Äù I created in my brain by looking at the symbol sequence matches what was in the author‚Äôs mind.</p>
<p>Because non-parallel symbols are used, dictionary-mechanical translation yields subtle results.‚Äù
The actual result of DeepL</p>
<p>twin danger:
(1) we will take one of these functional relationships as crucial and ignore the fact that felt meaning functions in others
(2) we will speak of felt meaning as an occurrence altogether apart from such relationships with symbol
There is a double jeopardy.
(1) To give importance to one of these functional relationships and ignore the fact that the felt meaning functions in other functions.
(2) To speak of the meaning of the felt as something entirely separate from its relationship to such a symbol.</p>
<p>I have not been able to connect ‚Äúfelt meaning‚Äù to the Japanese symbol for ‚Äúfelt meaning. I need to train my side to be able to recall the same felt meaning from the string ‚Äúfelt meaning‚Äù, or I need to specify the translation in a glossary. DeepL can specify a glossary, but it seems that Japanese is not supported.</p>
<p>By the way, here‚Äôs how I would translate it</p>
<p>There are two diametrically opposed dangers.
1: You give importance to only one particular one of the seven functional relationships explained in the previous section, and ignore the fact that ‚Äúfelt meaning‚Äù is also a function of the remaining six functional relationships.
2: Discussing ‚Äúfelt meaning‚Äù on its own, divorced from the seven functional relationships between symbols and</p>
<p>To avoid the second danger, one of the seven functional relationships, ‚Äúdirect matching,‚Äù can be used. Therefore, it is a twin danger, not two dangers, and this is not ‚Äútwo individual dangers‚Äù but ‚Äútwo sides of a coin‚Äù.</p>
<p>If you observe my translation again, you will see that there are many words mixed in that are not included in the short original symbol sequence. Where this comes from is that when I look at the symbols in the English text, I am reminded of experience X from the previous study session, contributing to the creation of ‚Äúfelt meaning‚Äù Y, which corresponds to this sentence. This is one RELEVANCE out of seven. And when expressing this ‚Äúfelt meaning‚Äù in a sequence of Japanese symbols, I thought that it would be ‚Äúeasier for readers to understand this part only on the groupware‚Äù if I supplemented the story of X as well as Y. So I acted accordingly. This ‚Äúspecifying the X aspect‚Äù is COMPREHENSION, which is the scope of the present discussion.</p>
<p>Another way to put it is that it makes no sense to talk about ‚Äúfelt meaning‚Äù in isolation from the functional relationship between symbols.
There exists ‚Äúmoyamoya,‚Äù right? and it does not make much sense to focus only on moyamoya, but we need to pay attention to how moyamoya becomes words, and how words affect moyamoya.</p>

The word ‚Äúprocess‚Äù doesn‚Äôt sit well with me personally.</p>
<ul>
<li>It doesn‚Äôt fit the ‚Äúfelt meaning‚Äù I conjure up with the word ‚Äúprocess.‚Äù</li>
<li>The expressions ‚Äúriver‚Äù and ‚Äúmotion‚Äù are used.
<ul>
<li>When we think of the ‚Äúmovement‚Äù of ‚Äúwater moving downstream,‚Äù all the water in various parts of the river is ‚Äúmoving downstream‚Äù at a certain point in time.</li>
