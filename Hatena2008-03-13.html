*1205373292*Cybozu is here!
Cybozu - I'll strangle you with handcuffs. http://d.hatena.ne.jp/rosylilly/20080305/1204719243

>>
I couldn't make it to the Cybozu Lab this time, so I hope to visit there next time.
&lt;&lt;

If I hadn't made a mistake, the venue would have been Cybozu Labs -orz.

I wonder if there will be a second or third or zero meeting this time? I seem to recall that Dwango and Cybozu Labs were rather far apart...

*1205374791*Canceled
The item I ordered on Rakuten Ichiba was cancelled saying &quot;not in stock&quot;. No, no, no, no. I ordered from you because it was in stock while most other stores were sold out (>&lt;).

I thought I had no choice but to go to a real store to buy it, so I went to the official website of the distributor and found a link to the online store from there, where it was sold as usual. The shipping cost is higher than the cost of transportation, but it's cheaper than the cost of transportation, so I'll buy it this way.

[O] [Acceptance temporarily closed] Co-importing &quot;CHUMBY&quot;. Would you like to take a bite?
http://overlasting.dyndns.org/2008-03-12-1.html

I'm late to the party, I learned about it from the registration deadline message on twitter. orz
But at least two people in the Cybozu lab bought WW.

-----

I guess I have to temporarily keep 2.5 million of other people's money. Thanks for your hard work.

*1205392217* HR not hiring as motivated students
Tokoroten - Diary / March 13, 2008 / HR who don't hire as motivated students should explode http://www16.atwiki.jp/tokoroten/pages/704.html

>>
In your case, if you get an offer from both our company and another company that is offering technical openings, you would go with the one that guarantees that you can do what you want to do. Making an offer to such a person is too risky compared to making an offer to someone else. Therefore, the Human Resources Department, not wanting to take such a risk, will never give you a job offer, and I cannot introduce such people to them either.
&lt;&lt;

In the end, what the company is looking for is not technical skills or motivated personnel, but safety tiles. It's a good thing you figured it out early. If you had carelessly entered such a company, you would have ended up leading a stressful life.
There are companies that allow their employees to try new things through &quot;in-house ventures&quot; while their own company pays their salaries. If I were in human resources, I would say, &quot;You have a two-year tenure, right? Then why don't you come work for us after that? I'd say, &quot;Well, then, why don't you come work for us after that?

-----

There was some reference to something involving Cybozu's HR, but I am not a Cybozu employee, nor am I in charge of HR at my current company. I apologize for the misleading expression. I just wanted to comfort my friend who did not receive a job offer.

*1205393350*PSoC
I found out that PSoC microcontroller is used in Gainer, and I thought I had heard of PSoC somewhere, so I checked the company that makes it and found out it is Cypress. Yes, I have heard of it somewhere.

*1205403437*Perl and Python added to Linux standards
Perl and Python Added to Linux Standards - @IT http://www.atmarkit.co.jp/news/200802/20/lsb.html

Heh heh. I guess standards are slow on their feet.

Why Linux standardization never took off - @IT http://www.atmarkit.co.jp/news/200803/11/lsb.html
>>
While Python and Perl have been added to LSB 3.2, Ruby is not included, largely because the specification is still unstable and there is no official specification in English.
&lt;&lt;

I wonder why Ruby doesn't have a clear specification apart from Matz's experimental branch, and I wonder if it would be difficult to create Ruby certification, JRuby, IronRuby, etc. if the specification is not clearly stated.

NetBeans mascot character is too cute

You're tempted to throw away the Eclipse explanations in the Jython book and move to NetBeans (impossible).

*1205404402*TMC Japan
I was wondering if it was SPAM, but when I read it, I found out that TMC Japan is a real company and the person who sent the e-mail is also on LinkedIn. TMC Japan is a real company and the person who sent the email is on LinkedIn under that company's name. I have no intention of changing jobs at this point. (I don't want to change my situation all the time, and I'm not dissatisfied with my current situation.)

I'm a little curious to see what they talk about.

I'm going to write it here for now and see if I get a response from other people saying, &quot;I got the same email here too! and see if there is a response.

*1205408000* Life hacks to expose the work scene.
http://twitter.com/yoshiori
>>
 Oh well, I won't skip work if I Ustream!
&lt;&lt;
>>
Only people from the company come here, so I'll expose them http://www.ustream.tv/channel/yoshiori
&lt;&lt;

That's it!
I swore I wouldn't play games, and I've been able to keep that promise, but I've been having trouble with my Twitter usage, which has increased dramatically. If I connect the internet to my MacBook and Ustream with it, I can see the Ustream camera side when I'm online, so it's obvious! That's it!

*1205424678* I ate rice.
OK, that's enough.
sleepy
The plan is to have completed seven chapters, but it's not done.
I will do amachang and freeciv if I get the whole manuscript done by tomorrow night, but it may not be possible.
I'm planning to do a Freeciv, which amachang has never been able to beat me yet, live on Ustream.

&lt;BODY>I thought you meant &quot;risk of declining the offer&quot;. I'm sure the HR department would be more than happy for you to accept the offer and join the company as their business. As a company, of course, it would be strange. &lt;/body>

&lt;username>TOKOROTEN&lt;/username>
&lt;body>In the end, I think the HR department's assessment system is based on how few people decline the job offer. &lt;BR>&lt;BR>The other thing is that this is the type of recruiter who holds the quota, so if you decline the job offer there, it will affect the recruiter's assessment. &lt;BR>&lt;BR>I thought I saw a bad company system where individual profit does not lead to company profit, and well, I learned a lot. &lt;br>It's not easy to match these guys, though. &lt;/body>
