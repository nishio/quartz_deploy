<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Well, maybe a blog post.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What kind of “blog” is this “blog”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Not a memorandum, but a type of article that wants to tell the reader something and elicit action.

<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Someone who’s not very good at writing says, “Whoa, maybe this will make writing easier than it’s ever been.” and say

<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Some people who are not good at it have the image of writing from the beginning on a blank piece of manuscript paper, but I think the royal road is to create parts and then rearrange them to compose sentences.

<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>It would be nice if you could actually try it, get a success story that you got a sentence done with it, and spread the word that it was a good idea to use it, and it would be even better if you could give me feedback on how to improve it.

<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Hmmm, “Let’s actually do it!” I wonder if I’ll be motivated to do that in the I wonder if they will be motivated by the fact that the person who created it is just now trying it out for the first time. If I use it for a while and say, “I wrote that sentence and this sentence using this,” will I be motivated? Oh, in that sense, I wrote the preface of “The Engineer’s Guide to Intellectual Production” using empathic writing.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What kind of “empathic writing” is this “empathic writing”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>I’m working on it right now, answering 10 questions and then rearranging them to make a sentence. I think the interesting point is that some of the questions focus on the emotions of the reader.

<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Maybe “eh, there’s no way I’m going to be able to write with this stuff.”
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What kind of “eh, there’s no way I can learn to write using this stuff” is that “eh, there’s no way I can learn to write using this stuff”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>The feeling that when you see a new tool, before you try it, you assume that this tool won’t work anyway.

<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Learned helplessness?

<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Giving up on the idea that I can’t do it anyway.

<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Oh, I answered the lines first. A person with that kind of sentiment says, “I’m useless anyway.”
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What kind of “use is that “use anyway”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>The usefulness of a tool is essentially the ability to create value with it after one has mastered its use, but there are often people who expect to suddenly get value from a tool without paying the cost of learning to use it, and these people move on to other tools after trying them and saying they are no good. In the end, they don’t learn any of the tools, so they don’t get value from any of them, and this reinforces their belief that they are no good anyway.

<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Hmmm, lack of success experience? I think that if you face a tool and learn it well, even if it is hard, you can really feel that there are tools that you can only get value from after you have mastered them. If you don’t have that kind of experience, you will repeat actions like copying and pasting code you found by googling.

<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Well, to be honest, I don’t care about such people, or I don’t think it is my responsibility to take care of such people. Parents or elementary schools should do it. Especially since this software is still in the process of being developed, it has many more problems than other tools in the world, and I think it is a tool that cannot be used without a certain level of competence.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What kind of “person” is this “person”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>People trapped in learned helplessness.

<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>It’s hard to use a tool that’s being built by someone who can’t avoid the inadequacies of the tool operationally.

<li>What kind of “mastery” is this “mastery”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>It’s more like a learning curve, or at least a minimum investment before it starts to create value. It’s like a learning curve to the point where it is no longer zero.

It was supposed to be an explanation to get people to use it, but halfway through, it’s starting to look like you’re not sure if you want them to use it. But, well, I guess I should say that this feature is not a finished product, and not everyone can easily get value from it.

<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>The author didn’t know if it would be worth it or not, since this was the first time it was used in the first place.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What kind of “value can be obtained” is that “value can be obtained”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>If I write good sentences as a result of this chat, OK.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What kind of “good writing” is that “good writing”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Ah, I see…I see…that’s a difficult question…I can tell after the fact that a text intended to elicit action from others was good writing when that action is actually elicited. I was initially hoping to elicit the action of “try it out,” but as we talked, I began to think that I didn’t need to try it out yet at this stage. Then what is the purpose of this text?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What else can you tell us about that “good writing”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>At any rate, I hope this gives you an idea of what I’m trying to create.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What kind of “I” is that “I”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>If you look closely, you’ll see that I answered the first question by saying, “I hope the reader can tell what the empathy writing mode I created today is all about.”
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>Is there anything else you can tell us about that “reader”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>If the message is conveyed and people think we are doing something interesting, that may be enough.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What is the “result” of this “result”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>👎 Result

<p>Hmmm, lack of success experience? I think that if you face a tool and learn it well, even if it is hard, you can really feel that there are tools that you can only get value from after you have mastered them. If you don’t have that kind of experience, you will repeat actions like copying and pasting code you found by googling.</p>
