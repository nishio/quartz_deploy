<li>Constraints to being part of a sustainable business model</li>

<li>
<p>Many companies tend to start with constraints that fit with existing business systems, and new ideas become mundane.</p>

<p>A culture in which it is better to ask permission later rather than ask for it up front, a culture that rewards success and forgives failure, removes a major obstacle to new ideas. p. 47</p>

<p>Relaxing the rules doesn’t mean allowing people to do stupid things; it means allowing people to play everyone’s part.”</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>I see, it is important that anyone can do it if they feel it is necessary, rather than thinking, “This is the work of that department, so it is not something our department should do.

<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>So don’t just discuss in abstract terms and think you know what you’re talking about, but make it concrete by building prototypes and gathering facts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Today, design is too important to be left to designers, the next generation of designers must be able to hold their own in executive meetings, and the habit of seeing every problem as a design problem.”</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>So in this book, what used to be called management issues are now called design?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our real goal is not a faster printer omission. That is the designer’s job. The design thinker’s job is to help people uncover inner needs that they don’t even realize they have.”</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Does the book distinguish between designers and design thinkers?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can’t discover surprising facts just by focusing on the center of the bell curve. We need to focus on the people at the end of the bell curve.” In designing kitchenware, they first surveyed children and professional chefs, not their main customers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Often we can get out of our narrow perspective by observing something similar, rather than the subject itself.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Empathy is the big difference that separates academic thinking from design thinking.&quot;&quot;Our goal is not to test theories. The role of design thinking is to create insights from observations and useful products from insights.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>I wrote in my book that “drawing makes abstract concepts more concrete,” and IDEO thought the same thing and conducted an experiment in which they asked subjects to draw pictures of money. I will mention it in a footnote.</p>

<li>People who draw 401k pension plans and rental real estate (looking at long-term security).</li>
<li>People who only write about money and goods (people who only think about short-term “buying things with money”).</li>

<p>“analysis and <a href="./comprehensive" class="internal" data-slug="comprehensive">comprehensive</a>,” “organizing and understanding vast amounts of information to create a coherent narrative,” “extracting valuable patterns from the raw information,” I’m using the words differently, but it sounds like it could support my book.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The design team will endlessly divergent thinking as long as there is an opportunity. In the meantime, the budget may run out.” “Put ideas to the butterfly test with post-its.” “Deadlines turn choices into decisions.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The usefulness of truth theory is also based on this idea: “Design thinking is the ability to do integrated thinking,” and “People who can contrast opposing ideas to come up with new solutions have an advantage over those who can only follow one idea when tackling a difficult problem. The person who can relativize correctness has an advantage over the person who can only accept one set of correctness.  <a href="./integrative-thinking" class="internal alias" data-slug="integrative-thinking">integrative thinking</a>.</p>

<li>
<p>We serve people, not chase numbers.”</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Okay, I saw a phase the other day where “chasing numbers” is treated positively, but in this book it is treated negatively. Interesting.</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Since profit is only a necessary condition for a company, it is not a rational thought to chase after more profit once the company is sufficiently profitable, but it would require a drastic change in mental model from the time when the company was trying to go from red to black, and that is where many companies fail to change their minds.</li>

<li>Organizations that encourage experimentation will have projects that do not lead to results</li>
<li>This kind of initiative is characterized by a culture that values productivity over innovation, and by companies that are in danger of falling into the “negative spiral of gradualism.</li>

<p>The best ideas come when the entire organizational ecosystem, not just designers and engineers, not just management, can afford to experiment!</p>

<p>Upper management uses their “gardening” skills to nurture, cut down, and incorporate ideas; MBAs call this <a href="./risk-tolerance" class="internal alias" data-slug="risk-tolerance">risk tolerance</a>, I call it the “topdown bit.”</p>
