<li>The original text was too casual to translate, sorry. What I wanted to convey here is as follows:.
<ul>
<li>The standard Python library mixes the UDPServer class with the ForkingMixIn class to create a new class before creating an instance.</li>
<li>It is clear from the name “MixIn” that ForkingMixIn should not be instantiated by itself.</li>
<li>However, it is not clear from the name whether UDPServer is a class that can be instantiated by itself.</li>
<li>ForkingMixIn provides a process_request method to UDPServer; does UDPServer need to have process_requests provided by other classes to work as expected, or can it be used on its own?</li>
<li>Python has no way to programmatically state what combinations are acceptable to use. So it is possible to create instances of classes that are not combined correctly.</li>
<li>Scala traitees have a way to declare “what methods are needed”.</li>

<p>While Perl creates a package to implement the counter, JavaScript uses a hash for the same purpose.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Another difference you may notice by looking at the code is the use of “this” as a keyword, which is a reserved word in JavaScript. When a function “my_method” is called in conjunction with an object “obj” (“obj.my_method()”), “this” is used to refer to “obj” within “my_method” itself.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>In Perl, we say “my $values = shift” to explicitly extract a parameter, whereas JavaScript obtains the value implicitly with a variable “this”. In the above example, since “this” is used within the function “push” when it’s called with “counter.push()”, “this” refers to “counter”. Therefore, we can replace “this” with “counter” and the program will still work.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>These aims can be achieved as in Perl’s packages.</p>

<li>
<blockquote>
<p>We call this association of a value with a name a “(named) binding”. By combining the open function “push” with the scope of “makeCounter”, the program no longer has to look for variable definitions outside of the scope because the function “push” is now a completed whole. We use the term “closed” to describe this state of completeness.</p>

<p>Another approach is to mark a process that shouldn’t be interrupted during its execution.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, we can decide that we mustn’t interrupt a thread that has the value of 0 in its memory.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>This makes it look like EACH THREAD has a mark, but in fact the THREADS SHARE the MARK. The “share” part of “share a mark” in the original text has disappeared.</li>
<li>Also, the value “must not be interrupted” when it is “non-zero”. The way it is written now, it would mean the opposite.</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Each thread checks the memory value of a process before its execution;</p>

<p>the process thread can be executed if the value is 0; if it’s the value is not 0, it the thread has to wait for it the value to become 0 again.</p>

<li>“create a new version of the process” This was hard to understand in the original.
<ul>
<li>Creating a new version” is, so to speak, “create a local copy of the shared values.</li>
<li>Instead of rewriting the shared X and Y directly, a local copy is temporarily created on hand and rewritten, and the changes on hand are reflected in the shared X and Y after the processing of one group is completed.</li>
<li>If someone else had rewritten the data before you did, you discard the revision at hand and start over with the new data. (This area is discussed on p. 182.)

If we talk about the writing system, it would be a country-by-country definition, which would not match the example of gal (gal characters in Japan are not defined in the orthography).

<li>A1 It is true that the lights that are on are black and the lights that are off are white, which may seem to be the opposite of the idea that the lights that are on are brighter, but the books have a white background, so the “lights off = same as background” are white. This is important when we get to the 7-segment story two pages ahead, where the 7-segment LCD has a light background and black text, while the 7-segment LED has a dark background and light text. Which is brighter is not essential; 0 is the same as the background and 1 is different from the background.</li>

<li>(try{…} ) is missing from the translation, as you pointed out, but I thought this sentence was too long to begin with.</li>
<li>What I want to say here is as follows

<li>For PL/I, write the error handling code first, then write the potentially erroneous code.</li>
<li>In today’s popular Java and other languages, write the potentially erroneous code first, and then write the error handling code.</li>

<p>The answer lies in its ability to facilitate the processing of certain types of code. Indeed, recursion allows us to write clear code when it comes to processing a nested data structure where a process is being applied to a certain parameter and, within this process, the same process is also being applied to another parameter. When dealing with a nested data structure, it’s common to write code with some nested structures init.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>The Japanese was muddled, as was the intent.
<ul>
<li>Recursive calls are easy when writing nested processes</li>
<li>Nested processing is a process in which one process is being performed while another is being performed on the same object.</li>
