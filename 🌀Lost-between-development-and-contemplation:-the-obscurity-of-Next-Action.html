<p>The paper explores the hesitation between development and contemplation and the criteria for making a decision to choose an action. The question of how to distinguish between escaping into speculation when no concrete action is in sight and prioritizing speculation when there is doubt about the development path was referenced in Nishio’s “Lost between Development and Speculation: Uncertainty of Next Action” and “The Tradeoff between Speculation and Development.”</p>
<p>He also submitted questions about the optimal balance in intelligent collaboration between AI and humans and how to guarantee the quality and accuracy of AI’s new functions. He also suggested the possibility that AI could express its own search behavior in words, which could then be coupled with a system that would receive them and perform search actions on its behalf that AI is unable to do.</p>
<p>He further suggested that in order for humans and AI to share the same objectives, it would be useful to write the objectives in microformat. This could allow humans and AI to share the same objectives.</p>

<p>The ability of an AI to verbalize its exploratory behavior is an important step toward performing exploratory behaviors on behalf of humans that they are unable to do. However, it is not yet clear how AI will acquire this capability and how it will use it. In addition, the notion that AI facilitates productive discussions by organizing discussion traffic requires a detailed explanation of how AI organizes discussions and how it makes them productive.</p>
<p>Also, a detailed description of how objectives are written in microformat and how this facilitates human-AI sharing of objectives is needed.</p>

<p>Explore the criteria for deciding whether to choose specific actions or to deepen speculation when the direction of development is unclear. Question how to distinguish between escaping into contemplation because of the lack of concrete next actions for development and trying to prioritize contemplation because of fundamental doubts about the development path.</p>
<p>Nishio’s “Lost between Development and Contemplation: the Unclear Nature of Next Action” is found to be relevant. The trade-off between contemplation and development” is also helpful. Clarity of project objectives is important, and AI has the opportunity to help users express their own ideas more clearly by understanding their input and asking questions about areas that are difficult to understand.</p>
<p>In “Mentor Personality,” future-oriented thinking patterns and an emphasis on helping the creator identify the process of identifying the cause of a bug are indicated. In addition, “The KJ Method: Letting the Chaos Speak for Itself” lists elements such as understanding the situation, evaluating, making decisions, and planning policies, concrete measures, and procedures.</p>
<p>In the “Textbook of Design Research,” finding out that “something you don’t know if you can do” can be done is an expansion of the scope of what can be done, moving it to the difficult side on the axis of technical difficulty. However, this is also an unconscious narrowing of the scope of search.</p>
<p>In “Teamwork with AI,” questions are submitted about the optimal balance in intelligent collaboration between AI and humans and how to ensure the quality and accuracy of new AI capabilities.</p>

<p>When the direction of development is unclear, we explore the criteria for choosing specific actions or deepening contemplation. Something is likely to emerge, but it is not clear, and you are not sure whether you should proceed with development or see what might emerge. How can you distinguish between escaping into contemplation because you cannot see a concrete next action for development and trying to prioritize contemplation over development because you have fundamental doubts about the current development path? Over time, it has become “accelerating contemplation to reach the edge of experience”.</p>

The fragments of “Equivalent Transformation Theory” provide a direction for solving the problem of “how to search for the starting system A.” This is one answer to the question that explores the criteria for choosing a specific action or deepening speculation when the direction of development is unclear. The “Thinking Node 2021 Unexplored Junior” fragment provides perspectives such as “when what you want to do is ambiguous” and “investigate different solutions to similar problems,” which provide a means to avoid escaping into speculation when the specific next action for development is unclear.</p>

<p>When the direction of development is unclear, it is more important to deepen contemplation than to choose specific actions. However, the contemplation should be done in such a way that it leads to concrete actions, and it should not be just vague thinking, but rather a search for specific problem-solving directions. In addition, deepening contemplation can lead to the discovery of new perspectives and means of solution.</p>
