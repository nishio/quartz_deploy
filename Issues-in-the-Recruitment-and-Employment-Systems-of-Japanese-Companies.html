The main points are as follows</p>
<ul>
<li>Large Japanese companies have strong <a href="./personnel-power" class="internal alias" data-slug="personnel-power">personnel power</a> in exchange for <a href="./lifetime-employment" class="internal alias" data-slug="lifetime-employment">lifetime employment</a>, so they emphasize <a href="./communication-skills" class="internal alias" data-slug="communication-skills">communication skills</a> to reduce the risk of recruitment failure.</li>
<li>Since companies do not provide specific <a href="./job-descriptions" class="internal alias" data-slug="job-descriptions">job descriptions</a>, it is difficult for educational institutions to grasp the kind of human resources that companies are looking for, resulting in a gap between educational content and company needs.</li>
<li>Companies place importance on communication skills because they hire new graduates with the expectation of long-term success, but in the future, <a href="./language-skills" class="internal alias" data-slug="language-skills">language skills</a> (<a href="./requirement-definition" class="internal alias" data-slug="requirement-definition">requirement definition</a>, <a href="./problem-partitioning" class="internal alias" data-slug="problem-partitioning">problem partitioning</a>, and <a href="./systemization" class="internal" data-slug="systemization">systemization</a>) are expected to become more important due to the advancement of IT and mechanization.</li>
<li>Many Japanese companies do not distinguish between “communication skills” and “verbalization skills.</li>
<li>The reason why communication skills are emphasized in Japanese companies is because <a href="./work-in-the-field-is-a-mass-of-tacit-knowledge" class="internal alias" data-slug="work-in-the-field-is-a-mass-of-tacit-knowledge">work in the field is a mass of tacit knowledge</a>, and you cannot learn a job without the ability to find out from your seniors.</li>
<li>Companies do not demonstrate linguistic skills when hiring, and job performance evaluations lack job descriptions, so rules tend to be retrofitted and goals are unclear.</li>
<li>Tacit knowledge is difficult to understand and improve, and communication skills alone are not sufficient.</li>
</ul>
<p>These points highlight issues rooted in Japan’s employment system and corporate culture. It is imperative to develop human resources with a long-term perspective, clarify job descriptions, and strike a balance between communication and verbalization skills.</p>

<p>Love_yellowhat: Students who were not very diligent in their studies are snatching up job offers from major companies by making use of their communication skills, while modest students who were honest and serious in their studies are not getting a single job offer. It makes me think about a lot of things.</p>

Because the work in the field is a mass of tacit knowledge, and it’s only in the mind of the senior staff, so you can’t learn the job unless you have the ability to ask that guy out.
Get to know each other, work together, and learn somewhat.</p>
<p>because this is considered “workable”.</p>
