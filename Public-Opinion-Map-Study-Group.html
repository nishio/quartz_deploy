<p>Our opinions are diverse by nature, to the extent that we can’t get all of them across just by casting a single vote every four years. What does society really think? Where do I fit in? If you make a map, you may find that there are already points of agreement, or you may find that the real axis of conflict exists elsewhere. Let’s visualize each person’s thoughts and ideas on the “Public Opinion Map,” a testing ground for democracy in the new era.</p>

</li>
<li>There is no explanation of what is meant by visualization and consensus display in the original document, but since it is often misunderstood, I decided to write it down properly.
<ul>
<li>Cluster size is not the number of people, but the scatter
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>This graph groups people who are close in opinion according to their answers to the questions. The distance between groups indicates the degree of difference in opinion. Therefore, group size does not indicate the number of people in a group, but rather the variability of their opinions. The summary of opinions shown is the result of AI analysis of the current opinion group data, and will be updated as more users answer the questions.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Consensus is not a majority vote, but rather a multiplication of the pros and cons for each cluster
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>“Everyone’s Consensus” is selected not by a simple majority vote by adding up everyone’s votes, but by a score obtained by multiplying the percentage of agreement and disagreement in each opinion group. In other words, even if a majority votes in favor of a proposal, it will not be selected if there is a group that strongly opposes it. Depending on the distribution of everyone’s opinions, nothing may be selected here.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The number of people in the cluster and the overall vote tallies are not shown.
<ul>
<li>By not displaying the number of people, it is difficult to tell which is the majority when the cluster is split in two.</li>
<li>By not giving the results of the overall vote, it makes it impossible to know “whether there is a majority in favor or a majority against this opinion.</li>
<li>I think that if you put these out there, you’ll end up ignoring the unfamiliar ones and just looking at the “normal <a href="./majority-rule" class="internal alias" data-slug="majority-rule">majority rule</a>” results.</li>

<li>I too was under the mistaken impression that you got the idea by doing TTTC, but but I see you already have a prototype running on 5/8 that uses Polis data to create AI commentary…</li>
<li>We talked about <a href="./mashbean" class="internal" data-slug="mashbean">mashbean</a> and <a href="./Polis-2.0" class="internal alias" data-slug="Polis-2.0">Polis 2.0</a>, so I guess it came from that.
<ul>
<li>This is a system that allows you to chat with AI based on cluster data</li>
<li>If you can do that, I’d like you to first explain what kind of cluster you’re talking about.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Q: How many people can withstand naming in LLM?
<ul>
<li>A: The LLM part is not too burdensome, since the first stage, Polis, does all the work of dividing the data into clusters and producing the feature values of those clusters. Even if there are 100 million users, the LLM part will not become a bottleneck.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Invisible Side of the Story</p>
<ul>
<li>Unknown how much access Polis can withstand
<ul>
<li>110,000 people in the past with the actual number of voting navigators; the commonly used scale of Polis is a few hundred, so 2~3 orders of magnitude larger.
<ul>
<li>We can increase resources since we are a self-funded operation, but we don’t know how large and how many resources we need in the first place.</li>
<li>Need to assume that the server may die</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>BTW, the Polis visualization is updated by polling asynchronously with user votes.
<ul>
<li>Line A
<ul>
<li>Users vote</li>
<li>DB is rewritten</li>
<li>PCA will be done</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>However, as a result of research to produce political party icons during this development process, it is now possible to calculate the position of your icon on the front end as well.</li>
<li>What does that mean?
<ul>
<li>It’s not essential that Line B is working.</li>
<li>If the PCA results are cached on the front end, the server will be fine even if the server dies!</li>
<li><img src="https://gyazo.com/b84da6bf2cb372fc3050c185caf6a362/thumb/1000" alt="image"/></li>
<li>In detail, the Polis server has a DB server and a compute server.
<ul>
<li>This compute server is the bottleneck
<ul>
<li>So we designed it not to assume that the compute server is alive.</li>
<li>No real harm at all if the compute server is dead.
<ul>
<li>User votes are recorded on the DB server so they can be recalculated later.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the DB server also dies, user votes will no longer be recorded.
<ul>
<li>I don’t think it’s going to fall that far since it’s just a small record INSERT into PostgreSQL.</li>
<li>but the spike when introduced on TV is a concern</li>
<li>made to fail silently without compromising the user experience.</li>

<p>Interesting findings</p>
<ul>
<li>The distribution is too homogeneous when the initial data is based on party manifestos.
<ul>
<li>There was some interesting behavior because of it.
<ul>
<li><img src="https://gyazo.com/6453699e8638d4c4b1ebd7c90bc2436b/thumb/1000" alt="image"/></li>
<li>I’m thinking humans are (1).</li>
<li>The actual data is (2).</li>
<li>The data looks equally correct to the machine in both of the two ways of dividing the data (3).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This results in unnatural clustering from a human perspective.</li>
<li>After about 10-20 people voted, it turned into a convincing cluster.</li>
<li>I think this is due to the fact that the method of “selecting opinions from a party’s manifesto, making them eligible for voting, and then considering them as the party’s voting results” results in “one person for each position” type data.
<ul>
<li>As a result, the weights on each axis are too equal</li>
<li>Voting by unrelated people distributes the weights of the axes, resulting in a more stable clustering.</li>

<li>The case of party opinion at all.

<li>→ Icons are also displayed in the exact same spot.</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>I see only 7 party icons? I thought there were only seven, but the JCP, Kiriwa New Election Party, and Social Democratic Party have the exact same views, so they are overlapped in the same place, and the Social Democratic Party is last, so it’s at the top of the list.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>I’m struggling with how to resolve this, do you rebound with a spring model, etc?</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve thought of several ways to solve this problem and how to implement it, but I feel that “create an icon with 3 parties in a row and treat it like a single party” is a good solution. I have already implemented the ability to specify the image and size of the icons individually.</p>

<p>Q&amp;A</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>Q: If answering the question brings you closer to a party you don’t like, will that create behavior to change your answer to avoid it?</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>I think that would be quite difficult.</li>
<li>Suppose that as a result of your answer, you “unexpectedly” moved closer to Party B instead of your favorite Party A.</li>
<li>To move away from B and closer to A, you have to give the same answer as A to a question where A and B have different opinions.
<ul>
<li>That means you have to know the opinion vectors of A and B.</li>
<li>However, the fact that he “unexpectedly” approached Party B means that he is not aware of Party B’s opinion vectors.
<ul>
<li>You don’t like party B, so you haven’t heard party B’s arguments properly, and you haven’t read their manifesto carefully.</li>
<li>If I read it correctly, the party B, which I hated emotionally, was actually the closest to my opinion, and I didn’t realize it, and I provided the opportunity to realize it.</li>
<li>I think it’s a learning opportunity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Even with a service like VoteNavi, the person thinks he or she supports Party A, but “the closest one is shown as Party B!” even though he/she intends to support Party A.
<ul>
<li>It may be more effective in promoting understanding at a finer granularity, since after answering a number of questions, the batch is told “close here” and each question moves on its own.</li>
<li>There’s a map for each of the big categories, like the Constitution and the tax system, so you can see things like, “Party A on the Constitution, but Party B on the tax system.</li>
