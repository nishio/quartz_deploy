*1382316308* &quot;Career Strategies - Diversity in People, Life and Work&quot; lecture material is now available.
On October 19, I gave a 1.5 hour lecture on career strategies with a focus on diversity at the Nada School Saturday Lecture. Some of the lecture materials are available here.

&lt;iframe src=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/27390660&quot; width=&quot;476&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; marginwidth=&quot;0&quot; marginheight=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;>&lt;/iframe>

I have read through all of the feedback that the participants wrote in the survey. There is one point that I may not have conveyed well, so I will add it here.


** &quot;Magic the Gathering&quot; or &quot;Programming&quot;?

The question was asked, &quot;Is it your intent that I should learn programming instead of spending all my time on Magic the Gathering?&quot; I was asked. No, it is not.

It seems that I have been perceived as claiming that &quot;Magic the Gathering&quot; (MtG) is inferior to &quot;programming&quot; as an object to invest time in during my junior high and high school years. I invested time in programming not because I thought it would be useful in the future, but simply because I enjoyed it. So in this respect, they are the same.

The next question is whether it is useful or not. In both cases, specific knowledge is not applicable. Even in programming, specific language specifications of a particular language or the names of functions are not applicable. It is the same as in mathematics, where you need to learn not the answer to a concrete problem, but how to solve it in an abstract way. The reason I think programming is more applicable to MtG than programming is because the word programming is more abstract than MtG. The reason why I think that programming is more applicable to MtG is because the term &quot;programming&quot; is more abstract than MtG. There is not much difference in the difficulty of application.

Conversely, the MtG side can be abstracted as &quot;actions that aim to win over others in situations where the element of luck cannot be removed. Thinking about how to achieve better results in such a situation can be applied to actions that aim to achieve results in a society where the element of luck cannot be removed. When you build a &quot;deck that is great when the draw goes well,&quot; you can experience firsthand that the bigger the deck, the lower the probability that the draw will go ideally, the longer it will take to get all the tricks in place, and unlike TV heroes, your opponent will not wait until you are ready to perform your special move. Unlike TV heroes, opponents don't wait until they are ready for their special moves. If you understand this experience in a more abstract way, you will be able to understand by analogy that the act of &quot;taking a lot of time to create an application that will be great when it succeeds&quot; in the real world is similar to this. I wonder what the real-world equivalent of the &quot;draw turnover card&quot; would be? If you are too afraid of the risk of a draw not going well and only play small pieces, will you end up in a situation where you lose consistently because you have too few damage sources, although you have fewer blips? I think it is important to take moderate risks and to use moderation.

I have no experience with MtG at all, so I may be writing about something misguided. So let's talk about Go. I am not a very strong Go player because I only went to a Go club and was taught a little, but there have been times in my life when Go has been useful to me. Go is a game in which two players take turns to play stones and compete for the amount of ground surrounded. In other words, the player who uses stones more efficiently wins. It is &quot;an action in which players compete on how efficiently they can manage their limited resources.&quot; Even when you need to connect stones, you do not make moves only for the purpose of connecting them firmly, but try to have other effects even if you have to weaken the connection a little. Can we make moves that have a positive impact in all directions as much as possible? Can't we somehow make effective use of the stones already in place for what we are trying to achieve? Isn't it better to surround yourself with a wide range of moves that take advantage of your strengths rather than making your strengths even stronger by making moves to them?

As I mentioned on p. 106 of the lecture material, if we are not careful, we tend to talk about the bracketed &quot;right answer&quot; such as &quot;you should learn X&quot;. But that is not correct. What was good for me is not necessarily good for you. I think it's better to learn programming instead of MtG (I didn't do MtG, I just did programming, but maybe I would have been happier if I had done MtG... no, no, no, that's not true, it's important to learn programming. (I'd like to think...)&quot; is just an attempt to justify your past choices. It is not advice for you. You should learn programming, not MtG (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/477415654X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=247&amp;creative=7399&amp; creativeASIN=477415654X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=nishiohirokaz-22&quot;>Buy my book! &lt;/a>)&quot; is just trying to profit from talking about the 'right answer'. It is much easier to tell the &quot;right&quot; answer. Besides, it is more popular to give the &quot;right answer&quot; to an audience that wants someone to tell them the right answer. But I don't think this is a sincere attitude.


** Aufheben
>>
@kuenishi Good stuff, X or Y? reminded me of the word Aufheben for the first time in a long time.
&lt;&lt;

Correct answer! While writing this slide, I was a little worried about whether to include &quot;Hegel's Dialectic&quot; or not. However, I thought that replacing the word &quot;good points&quot; with &quot;Aufheben&quot; would not only not help me understand, but would rather make me feel like I was being blown up in smoke, so I omitted it.

Many people seem to agree with the idea that &quot;abstraction has the widest range of application,&quot; but if we take that further, it should be &quot;philosophy has the widest range of application,&quot; right? But not many people agree here. Why is that? My own answer is that &quot;knowledge must be rooted in experience to be applicable.


** How did you create this lecture material?

I honestly did not anticipate this question, so I verbally told them, &quot;Please read ~ later. It is
&lt;a href='http://nhiro.org/kuds2013/'>'Designing Teamwork' Lecture Material&lt;/a>&quot; &quot;&lt;a href='http://www.slideshare.net/nishio/kj-26687739'>Preliminary and Actual KJ Method Flow&lt;/a >&quot;. As for why we are working on writing on stickies and then summarizing, see &quot;&lt;a href='http://www.slideshare.net/nishio/ss-26687453'>Write and then think&lt;/a>&quot; and &quot;&lt;a href='http://www. slideshare.net/nishio/kj-26723200'>Background on the KJ Method&lt;/a>&quot;.
