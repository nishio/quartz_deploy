summary</p>
<ul>
<li>Chatbots are working on the side of humans and are less likely to be autonomous.
<ul>
<li>I like the feeling of a human being going to see it occasionally as it moves on its own at a greater distance.</li>
<li>Specifically, Twitter bots.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Wise words bot as a first step in “worthwhile output.”
<ul>
<li>Intellectual production is the creation of “information fragments that have been cut into the size of a tweet and made easy to distribute.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="./program-for-intellectual-production-without-humans" class="internal alias" data-slug="program-for-intellectual-production-without-humans">program for intellectual production without humans</a>.</li>

<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>I wish I could be more clear about my own intellectual production program.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What kind of “clarification” is this “clarification”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>We know what to implement and how to implement it. Right now we don’t know, so we are first creating a program that will help human intellectual production and increase intellectual production as a whole, but there is no program that will produce intellectual production without humans as an extension of this program. We need a different approach.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What kind of “program” is this “program”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Input information on its own, without human manipulation, and output new and useful knowledge that did not yet exist in the world.

<p>I know what to implement and how to implement it.

</li>
<li>Is there anything else you can tell us about this “program”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Hmmm, there are two programs coming up, but let’s talk about the more obvious former one. This program is invoked by a human and takes as input what the human writes. It then outputs a question statement. We can judge whether this questionnaire is useful or not based on whether or not it prompted the human receiving it to notice it.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>Where is this “program” located?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Runs 24 hours a day on a server

<li>How do you know about this “program”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>I made this up because when I went to study coaching techniques, I was told that coaches should be careful not to interpret their clients’ statements without their permission, and I thought that computers are inherently better at that than humans.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What kind of “human being” is this “human being”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Human coaching. I have also tried human coaching and found the method itself to be very beneficial. However, it is expensive, and while a chat can return the text as it is typed, a voice coachee may fail to catch or unintentionally ignore the expertise of the coachee because the coachee does not have it.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What is it that you value?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>At this point, I don’t know how a program can create value without humans, so I am focusing on creating value as a set with humans. However, I would like to create a program that can create value without me before I die. I can’t move toward completion without advancing my consideration of how to create that. Let’s see, so to summarize, I see value in getting an idea that will take me one step forward toward creating a program that can produce intellectually and create value without humans.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>Where is this “program” located?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>As for where they are, the current system is closely exchanging information on the human side, but the new system is working on its own at a more remote location. For example, they have their own Twitter account and send out information on their own, and I go to see them from time to time.

<li>What does this “program” look like?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>So it’s in the form of a chatbot that responds to what humans say, so it’s reduced to a subordinate object to humans, and you don’t see a future where it becomes an independent, autonomous program. It’s like a fixed-point camera in a zoo that shows what is active in the absence of humans.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What would you like to see happen with respect to that “program”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>The program is primarily autonomous, but the resulting product should be of value to humans
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What needs to happen to the “program” for that to happen?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>We need to be able to output something that people would find valuable.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>As for the “program,” can it?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>One possibility is a quote bot, the common one simply outputs the original data, and you can use this as a generative model, or you can give it a larger article, and it will cut out a tweet-sized piece from it and tweet it with the source (I made the latter once in a hackathon). In either case, “fragments that have been cut out to the size of a tweet and are easy to distribute” are generated, and the number of reactions will tell you how much value people find in them.

<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>I left it alone after the hackathon, but I’ll dig it out and see what kind of code it is.</li>
