<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>It would be good if you could verbalize what exactly you will do about the speaking project.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What kind of “speaking project” is this “speaking project”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Speak to junior and senior high school students at your alma mater. Decide what to talk about, prepare lecture materials, speak on the day, and answer questions.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What kind of “do” is that “do”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>If the sum total of the value gained by the audience is greater than the value of the life time I lose in preparing for the talk, then the world will change for the better.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What kind of “talk” is that “talk”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>I wonder what exactly it is…by imparting knowledge that is useful in life. You can’t decide on a topic to talk about because you don’t know what is good to communicate.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What kind of “role” is this “role”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>The effect is to change life in a direction favorable to the individual.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What kind of “life” is that “life”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>The audience is basically those who were in the top handful at the junior high school entrance examination stage, and I wonder if it is safe for them to stay with the same behavioral principles in the future. For example, the brand value of Tokyo University will remain for a while, but its effectiveness as a signal of competence is declining because the number of young people is decreasing rapidly, and it is unknown how effective it will be when 15-year-olds start working after 10 years.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What is it that you value?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>I hope that the information I share will help my audience think about their future lives and provide them with a perspective that is a little different from their current perspective or their parents’ perspective so that they can think from multiple angles and make better choices.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>Is there anything else about that “life”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Admitting that there is a bias in my point of view, it is still “impossible that I can’t program or something”. The reason why this is so comes down to the parable of the Tayupinko people. And since they have above-average logical thinking ability, it is not difficult for them to learn programming as a technical skill if they want to do so. The difficulty lies in the question of “what to make. This is not a technique, there is no right answer, and it is an artistic ability of self-confidence.

<li>Where is this “life”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>In front of each person is the form of multiple paths. Since each person is in a different situation and has different choices, we cannot tell them “this is the right path. Therefore, it is necessary to impart wisdom to help each person make a better choice.

<li>How do you know this “life”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Hmmm, I don’t know, I’m here now as a result of the choices I made somewhat at each timing.

<li>Where is this “life” located?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>It was a mistake to say that there is a path, which exists only in a hazy and vague way. Most of the time, there is only a faint, hazy, faint path. So we follow what is barely in front of us.

</li>
<li>What kind of “audience” is this “audience”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>They are people who are groping their way through the haze, while their parents’ values and groupthink lead them to overconfidence in certain options, thinking that there must be a path this way or that this path will lead them to the paradise of the Peach Blossoms.

<li>What is this “life” like?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>It is a dangerous mountain road. If you fall off a cliff, you can get hurt; there is no guarantee that the road will be in the same place it was 30 years ago.

<li>What would you like to see happen regarding this “life”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>I hope you can be proactive and make your own decisions and choose your own path.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What needs to happen in “life” for that to happen?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Hmmm, I guess I need more confidence in my own judgment…
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>Can you do that with regard to “life”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>I have a bias to think that I made the right choice in the past because I look back and see the past, and I have a lot of confidence that I made the right choice. Confidence may be a cognitive distortion.
