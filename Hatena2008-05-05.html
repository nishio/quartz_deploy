*1209978235*Diary of the 3rd day of consecutive holidays
Today is game day
http://lincity-ng.berlios.de/wiki/index.php/Main_Page


-----
It seems to me that making a game by oneself is a path that boys who like PCs always take, but it is not easy to make something that will last. (In rare cases, however, there are people who find their own artists, music makers, and even voice actors to organize the project). This is not a dig at anyone, but rather a reflection on my own past. I don't think there are any left, but when I was in junior high school, I made a detective game in Visual Basic 2.0. I don't remember the details, but when it was made in VB and the pictures were drawn with a paintbrush, I'm sure it was of a quality that I can't show you.

But nowadays, there are many games whose source codes are available to the public. Modifying the source code of such games and playing them is another option. I thought to myself.
-----

*1209987590*LinCity
http://lincity-ng.berlios.de/wiki/index.php/Main_Page
Binaries and source code for Windows are available from the download page.

The game is simply SimCity. Plus Age Of Empire, minus war. There are no monsters or earthquakes. There are fires, but as long as the fire department covers the area, they don't happen, or if they do, they rarely spread.

But the interesting part is that resources are not a one-way street. It is not just a simple &quot;we need more metal&quot; or &quot;let's build a mining site in the vein. For example, the easiest way to get metal is to build a mining site (ore mine), which can be located anywhere. However, after a certain amount of metal is extracted, it is replaced by a pond, a 4x4 16-square water block. By the way, reclaiming a water block costs a ridiculous amount of money, about 100 million. And even if you pay that amount of money to reclaim the water block, you can no longer build a mining site there. In other words, the approach of obtaining metals by mining is not sustainable.

What to do, then, is to import or recycle to produce it, but this cannot be done without some development of science and technology. Even if we import, we need to make a profit in some way. For example, a simple method would be to build a large scale farm that produces more food than is needed, export the resulting food, and use the money to import it.

-----

The first place where I got stuck was when I went through the tabs in the information box in the lower right corner that lit up yellow or red to inform me of an emergency situation, and I got into a lot of trouble. First, red, which means that food has been depleted and people are starving to death somewhere; select Show Nourishment on the map to check where the starvation is happening. Also, if you have selected a road or market other than bulldozers, you can click on a nearby road or market to see how much resources (food and metal) are stored on that road or market. This is the cause of the starvation, which is now at 0%. Even if a large amount of food is produced in remote areas, it will not reach you if the roads are not connected.

Well, I understood this one right away, but the next one is hard to understand. Yellow means there were unemployed. This is due to the fact that the nearby market job is now at 100%. You would think it was the other way around. In this game, &quot;job&quot; means labor force, and &quot;there are 100% jobs in the market&quot; = &quot;no more jobs can be accepted from housing&quot; = &quot;overflow of people are unemployed&quot;. Unemployment tends to be neglected because it does not cause as immediate and obvious a change as hunger, but it is also quite an emergency. First, taxes are not received because people are there (consuming food) but not working. If people are unemployed, it is recorded as an expenditure (unemployment insurance?!). . The percentage of the population that is homeless increases (it seems that unemployment does not necessarily mean homelessness). When the number of homeless people increases too much, they start living in tents in arbitrary places, and it costs a lot of money to remove these tents.

When I first started playing, all I saw was population and food, and I kept repeating, &quot;When we have enough food, we build houses, and when we run out of food, we build farms,&quot; but then I suddenly realized that there was a huge tent settlement and 60 percent of the population was homeless.

-----
By the way, if you prefer to have a lot of choices from the beginning, you can start with good_times, if you prefer medium, you can start with random village, and if you prefer nothing, you can start with Beach. The tutorial recommends the medium one. good_times starts with a lot of money and buildings with science and technology advanced to 60%. random village is a map with a river and a little bit of building. Random village is a map with a river and a few buildings.

I haven't played Beach for a bit yet, so I'm going to try to see how far I can go in an hour now.

-----
I took a screenshot but it's not very pretty because I had to paste it &amp; I scaled it down. I just now became able to build a rocket.

-----
The second place where I got stuck was when I was able to build a university, and I was trying so hard to build industries and build universities over and over again, but the science power was just hovering between 50% and 60%. I was looking at the help and it said &quot;5 schools per university are needed to supply students&quot;. Conclusion that I should read the help properly and carefully to the end. I guess that's what the value &quot;capacity&quot; means on the detailed information screen of a university. I had read that universities are more efficient than schools, so I had been building only universities, but it is a trap that there is no point in building only universities because there are not enough schools to supply students. It is no wonder that the technology is not increasing.

Once we figured that out, we easily got to 100% technical capability. At any rate, after launching 5 rockets, manned flight becomes possible, and each manned flight can transport 1,000 people to another planet. Once all the people were transported, the flight was cleared. The population is about 9,000.

Mu. Is it going to continue to cost money to produce rockets? We've failed...we're in the red by 300 million yen.

No. Even if we mine and export the ore, we are still in the red. Financial collapse.

-----
I'm wondering if I should be disappointed and go to bed, or if I should try again.

-----
After this I made a rocket in about 70 minutes at GOOD TIMES.

Then, unable to suppress his excitement, he presses the launch button without checking the technical capabilities at that time (which will determine the success rate of the launch), and the bomb explodes and the surrounding area catches on fire (oh).

-----
Well, if you don't make any progress after 15 minutes of doing whatever you're doing, you're saying that you should first double-check the documentation.
I feel I can do better next time. But I won't do it today.
&lt;/body>
