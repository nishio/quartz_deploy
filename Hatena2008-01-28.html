Indentation in *1201488453*actionscript-mode.el: Solution
I'm using actionscript-mode.el, but I'm having a lot of trouble getting the layout to look like the code below.
>|actionscript|
	graphics.moveTo(
					v0.car.x + v0.car.width / 2,
					v0.car.y + v0.car.height / 2
					);
||&lt;
I got a trackback from odz, so I tried it. (For some reason, the entry has disappeared.)

GNU Emacs Manual: Changing Indent Style
http://www.geocities.co.jp/SiliconValley-Bay/9285/EMACS-JA/emacs_256.html

If you think the indentation is wrong, &quot;M-x c-set-offset&quot; (or C-c C-o) will prompt you for a name that means its syntactic position, like &quot;Syntactic symbol to change: arglist-close&quot;. You can just enter here. Next, you will be asked to specify the indentation of the position, like &quot;arglist-close offset (default c-lineup-arglist):&quot;. In my case, I set &quot;arglist-intro&quot; (lines 2 and 3) to &quot;+&quot; and &quot;arglist-close&quot; (line 4) to &quot;0&quot;.

*1201511605*Geek Set Restaurant
Inherit the A set meal and override the miso soup with pork miso soup.

*1201514067*Golden Division Method
I made it in Python, which I was familiar with, before implementing it suddenly in ActionScript.

First, find the golden ratio.
>|python|
>>> from math import sqrt
>>> sqrt(5)
2.2360679774997898
>>> sqrt(5) / 2 + 0.5
1.6180339887498949
>>> GOLD = _
||&lt;

Check that the inverse of the golden ratio and the golden ratio minus 1 coincide (just in case).

>|python|
>>> 1 / GOLD
0.61803398874989479
>>> GOLD - 1
0.6180339887498949
||&lt;

1 / GOLD / GOLD to G2.
>|python|
>>> (GOLD - 1) / GOLD
0.38196601125010515
>>> 1 / GOLD / GOLD
0.3819660112501051
>>> G2 = _
||&lt;

I made a function that takes a minimum value when a is 0.3, but this is a secret.
>|python|
>>> def foo(x):
	return (x - a) ** 2

>>> a = 0.3
||&lt;

Create a function to find the minimum value by search.

>|python|
>>> def search(start, end):
	diff = end - start
	a = start + G2 * diff
	b = end - G2 * diff
	fa = foo(a)
	fb = foo(b)
	for i in range(10):
		print &quot;f(%f)=%f, f(%f)=%f&quot; % (a, fa, b, fb)
		if fa &lt; fb:
			end = b
			b = a
			fb = fa
			diff = end - start
			a = start + G2 * diff
			fa = foo(a)
		else:
			start = a
			a = b
			fa = fb
			diff = end - start
			b = end - G2 * diff
			fb = foo(b)

			
>>> search(0, 1)
f(0.381966)=0.006718, f(0.618034)=0.101146
f(0.236068)=0.004087, f(0.381966)=0.006718
f(0.145898)=0.023747, f(0.236068)=0.004087
f(0.236068)=0.004087, f(0.291796)=0.000067
f(0.291796)=0.000067, f(0.326238)=0.000688
f(0.270510)=0.000870, f(0.291796)=0.000067
f(0.291796)=0.000067, f(0.304952)=0.000025
f(0.304952)=0.000025, f(0.313082)=0.000171
f(0.299927)=0.000000, f(0.304952)=0.000025
f(0.296821)=0.000010, f(0.299927)=0.000000
||&lt;

I was able to get close to 0.299927 just by calling foo 11 times (the secret answer was 0.3, right?!).

-----

I debugged it in Python, which I was familiar with, so porting it to ActionScript was a snap.
I made it a function when it should have been a function, so it's not a one-shot deal.

>|actionscript|
class GoldenRatioSearch{
  public static var G2:Number = 0.38196601125010515;
  public static function search(f:Function):Number{
	var diff:Number = 1.0;
	var start:Number = 0.0;
	var end:Number = 1.0;
	var a:Number = start + G2 * diff;
	var b:Number = end - G2 * diff;
	var fa:Number = f(a);
	var fb:Number = f(b);
	for(var i:int=0; i &lt; 10; i++){
	  if(fa &lt; fb){
		end = b;
		b = a;
		fb = fa;
		diff = end - start;
		a = start + G2 * diff;
		fa = f(a);
	  }else{
		start = a;
		a = b;
		fa = fb;
		diff = end - start;
		b = end - G2 * diff;
		fb = f(b);
	  }
	}
	if(fa &lt; fb){
	  return a;
	}
	return b;
  }
}
||&lt;

At any rate, I think I'll take this as a souvenir and &lt;del datetime=&quot;2008-01-28T21:19:11+09:00&quot;>punch in&lt;/del> to the Spark Project and apply to participate.

No partial points (0 points if not completely correct), 12 correct answers out of 20 questions, 60 points.
It turns out that Python knowledge is somewhat useful for ActionScript, too. w


Below are the impressions I wrote while solving and grading the puzzles.

1
C knowledge that postfix increment returns the value before the increment.
 [correct] 

2
The case that substitution is not copying. Fundamentals.
 [correct] 

3
Mm? As a Pythonista, I can honestly think that f = o.f will put the method object already bound to the instance into f, but you're assigning it to a Function type in ActionScript.... I wonder if the information of the bound instance is lost.
 [correct] 

4
Short-circuit operators; C language basics.
 [correct] 

5
This is also a short circuit operator. b = f2() is not evaluated.
 [correct] 

6
This is either pass-by-reference or pass-by-value, or if you like the confusing terminology, &quot;pass-by-value of reference,&quot; or something like that.
 [correct] 

7
Talking about whether the block makes scope or not. Don't know.
But if the scope is not created, I think I get a compile error due to duplicate variable definitions.
[Incorrect]
>>
ECMAScript blocks do not have the ability to generate new scopes.
&lt;&lt;
I see. I tried it and found that if the type of variable I declare inside and outside the block is different, I get a compile error, but not if they are the same. I see.

8
The question is whether the assignment to the attributes of the instance is written to the prototype or not. It cannot be written.
 [correct] 

9
I'm talking about whether the way variable names are resolved is lexical or what. I think it is lexical. If it is lexical, then b is 1.
 [correct] 

10
Whether to pollute the global space when not declaring a var. It does pollute, so be careful, I learned it in JavaScript.
 [correct] 

11
Nothing is too difficult.
[incorrect orz].
>>
ECMAScript does not allow functions to be defined within blocks. Therefore, functions are treated as if they do not exist.
&lt;&lt;
Mmm. I see.

12
Nothing difficult. Oh, it's for people who are not used to making functions in such a place.
[Incorrect (vomiting blood)
>>
Unnamed functions cannot be called on the fly.
&lt;&lt;
http://f-site.org/articles/2004/08/23074843.html
>>
In JavaScript, it seems to work fine.
&lt;&lt;
Mmm.

13
Hmmm. This is where a = 4, 5, 6 would be interpreted as a tuple a = (4, 5, 6) in Python, but I don't think EcmaScript has a tuple. I think this is just a meaningless parenthesis that is actually passed to TRACE as a variable length argument.
[Incorrect]
It seems to be a comma operator. I thought it would display &quot;456&quot;, but it only displayed &quot;6&quot;.

14
This is indeed not clear. I think String(undefined) is going to be undefined at the end.
I just found out that there is a null string, so I wonder if String(null) is &quot;null&quot;. Does it become an empty string?
To begin with, if the last String(undefined) is undefined, does &quot;undefined&quot; == undefined become false or undefined?
I thought so when I saw #15.
[Incorrect]
Only the last two are not true, which was true, but null exists, and the comparison operation with undefined is not undefined.

15
Isn't this normally false, with True being undefined?
 [correct] 

16
Let's see... Is it -1?
 [correct] 
Subtle; I didn't know in the first place whether EcmaScript had long integers or not.

17
Wow. If you put this in the question, that means it's uniquely determined. I'm a very naive person, so I don't consider the possibility that &quot;the constructor's assignment to b is a grand fishing expedition, and the correct answer is abc order. If that is the case, the last assignment will come first.
No. Maybe the last referenced one also comes before? Mm?
[Incorrect]
Well, the question was asking whether the instance or the prototype has it....

18
The question is whether class members are initialized at the time of class definition or at the time of instantiation. I think so, but I am suspicious that you are making this an issue all the way through.
 [correct] 
Be careful.

19
What's that? What's this?
It's straightforward when you think about it....
The fact that this is a problem is due to a special method around start,
Like it will be called on its own after the instance is created?
[Incorrect]

20
If you think about it honestly, it's the same problem as the first one.
[Incorrect]

*1201534814* eplus registration in progress
You make me enter my credit card number, but your password is limited to alphanumeric characters and 4 to 11 characters, what are you thinking?
Why do they only accept full-width addresses?
You're cutting corners in that area, so why are you implementing something that makes no sense, like the mouse cursor changing to something that is not an I-beam on the input field?
Why does it scroll to the top of the page when I fill out the form and hit the confirm button?
If it wasn't to get a ticket to Rahmens, I would have left on the way.

*1201539815*Reuse Haskell show
http://d.hatena.ne.jp/hoge1e3/20080128
>>
    * Normally, use the default show
    * I want to customize the show for some classes.
&lt;&lt;

I tried to make it a show instead of a toString.

>|haskell|
data Pair = Pair {car::Pair, cdr::Pair} | Null | Value Int

instance Show Pair where
    show (Pair x y) = &quot;(&quot; ++ show x ++ &quot; . &quot; ++ show y ++ &quot;)&quot;
    show Null = &quot;()&quot;
    show (Value x) = show x


main = putStrLn $ show $ (Pair (Value 1) (Pair (Value 2) Null))
||&lt;

I was a Java user myself, so I kind of understand,
data Foo ..... deriving Show.
class Foo extends Show
It's a mistake to think like that, and the equivalent is more like.
instance Show Foo where ...
I think it is.
