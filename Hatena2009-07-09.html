*1247117196* symbol abstraction
http://d.hatena.ne.jp/masatoi/20090707/1246965336
I was going to write about this, but it got tedious, so I'll just post the problems I made.

[***_**-*^]
[****_***-**^^]
Now, properly fill in the blanks represented by . Fill in the blanks appropriately (the number of dots does not mean the number of characters)
[*^_^-...
||&lt;

In elementary schools, they teach that the symbol &quot;=&quot; is used to express &quot;equivalence relation of expression values,&quot; but this does not mean that &quot;=&quot; inherently has such a meaning, but merely that &quot;humans have decided to use this symbol to express such a meaning because it just happens to be convenient. I think people don't understand that. So, as long as you and the person you are communicating with share the same definition, it does not matter if you switch the meanings of + and =.

>||
1=1+2
1=2+3
2=3+5
3=5+?
? Fill in the ?
||&lt;

When solving a mathematical problem, you can reduce the amount of writing by declaring, &quot;In the following, r * (cos(θ) + i * sin(θ)) is written as &lt; r, θ >. Conversely, when we do not know the definition, we can infer the definition from the observed facts.

>||
1=1-1
2=1-2
2=2-4
3=3-?
? Fill in the ?
||&lt;

I suppose there are aspects of &quot;understanding a programming language,&quot; such as reading the specifications to understand the definitions, or reading the source code to infer the definitions. And &quot;definition&quot; is, after all, a human decision, not necessarily a significant one. Why does + have the meaning of addition? That's why the Latin et in the first place... Why do some differential symbols dot the top and others use d? That's because Newton and Leibniz didn't get along... I guess those stories are interesting for those who are interested, but they are not necessary to understand and be able to use the concepts of addition and differentiation. I'm not saying it's &quot;pointless&quot; because knowing the historical background of how derivatives came into being and such might &quot;thicken&quot; the understanding of derivatives, but still, I don't think it's something that should be emphasized much.

*1247156067*Chiral and Achiral
I thought it was difficult because I suddenly thought in three dimensions, so I drew a two-dimensional picture.

Mr. C, pulling himself out of the mirror.


If we decide that it's forbidden to peel the 2-D world person off the desk and turn him over, the reflections in the mirror often don't overlap no matter how you turn them. a happens to be symmetrical, so if you turn it around, you'll get the same shape.

&lt;img src=&quot;http://gyazo.com/0b3f8f41dfa5e0c06d2f36e890829822.png&quot;>

Glasses-kun is not symmetrical, but it is symmetrical back and forth, so it has the same shape from the beginning when it is reflected in a mirror.

&lt;img src=&quot;http://gyazo.com/2c36d3c2e2a53bbe613be834ecb73d23.png&quot;>

The third example is neither symmetrical nor symmetrical.

*1247157324*3rd World Farmer Introduction
http://www.arcadetown.com/3rdworldfarmer/gameonline.asp

I've been meaning to introduce it for a while now and forgot about it. A game to experience an African farmer.
There is a yearly turn system, with phases of buying and planting seedlings, buying farming equipment, building huts, buying livestock, taking medicine, building roads, getting married, and &lt;del>selling children&lt;/del> to work in town, and then the year passes and the harvest screen for that year appears. Repeat. Every year some event occurs. There is no shortage of good harvest events, but most of them are negative, such as bank failures, civil wars, or cows being wiped out by disease. If you make a big mistake early on or are inexplicably unlucky, you will find yourself in a situation where you cannot recur. If you can avoid that, the clearing itself is not too difficult.

&lt;a href='http://www.4gamer.net/specials/thirdworldfarmer /thirdworldfarmer.shtml'>[4Gamer.net] [Feature] Serious Game &quot;3rd World Farmer&quot;. A new look at the &quot;fun&quot; of the serious game &quot;3rd World Farmer&quot;&lt;/a>.

In the next entry, I will write the flow of the game until you complete it once for now. If you want to enjoy the process of understanding the flow itself, please read it after playing the game.

*1247166416*3rd World Farmer Strategy
Year 1: 2 adults, 2 kids. couple 28 and 25 yrs old. Kids are 8 and 6. you had them at 17. something for 50$. Now. Corn, wheat, peanut seed prices are 13, 15, 20, 19. plant corn and nuts which are cheaper seeds. 18$ left but what to do. Plant oats too. 3$ left. Time to move on.

Result: thief event occurs (Theft), shovel and other light farm equipment is stolen. I don't have it yet, so it doesn't matter. Corn, wheat, and peanuts yielded 14, 19, and 26 respectively. The total of 59 multiplied by the family's WORK CAPACITY of 220% yields 130, which is the actual income. Combined with the carryover of 3, from which we subtract 10 for living expenses, the remainder is 123.

Year 2: 22 with meds for all. 101 remaining. 9, 9, 23, 20 for seed. is the price of the commodity lower when the seed is cheaper? I'm not sure about that yet. I planted corn, wheat, and peanuts because they were cheap. I have 63 left to buy a sickle. 28 left to buy shovels or cotton. Hmmm... Cotton is expensive. Maybe a shovel. 3 left...move forward in time.

Result: elephant poacher event (Elephant Poacher), elephants are wiped out. I'm fine with it because I don't have them yet. Corn, wheat, and peanuts yielded 10, 12, and 29 respectively. The farmer's bonus is +25%, so 64. work capacity is 210%, so earnings are 134. 126 left over for carry-over and living expenses.

Year 3: 48 with everyone dosed; 78 left; 10, 9, 20, 20 seeds; all planted, 19 left; subtle. I can add one more corn and one more wheat and use them all up, but then the event that wipes out all the crops will leave me with nothing to do the next time. 19 left.

Result: peanut destruction event. Yields were 11, 11, 23, 0. 56 at +25%. 118 multiplied by 211%.

Year 4: I wonder if it's time to diversify my risk by getting into livestock. I need 75 to keep chickens. Well, first the medicine. I forgot to look at how much it was. I can't plant seeds if I keep chickens. Let's put it off. There are 11, 10, 19, and 20 seeds. 24 left after planting one of each.

Result: fire breaks out. Shed burns down. Good thing we didn't build it. Yields were 12, 14, 24, 11. 76 at +25%, 170 at *224%. kids are growing and labor is increasing. Total is 181.

Year 5: Well, let's get some chickens...build a shed...50...keep chickens...25...106 left...medicate them all...10...surprisingly inexpensive...and they're all healthy...I'm not sure if they are. They're all healthy. That's a good thing. Seeds: 9, 18, 21, 20... Wheat is expensive. I planted all of them, one at a time. 28 left. 28 left...maybe I should get another chicken.

Result: wheat wipeout event. Harvested 10, 0, 25, 35. +25% for 81. Chickens 2*8*110% for 18. 4 years to pay back.... That's a long time. No, there is *213%, so 2 years. This year's income was 211, bringing the total to 201.

Year 6: Dose, 38. 163 left. 12, 15, 19, 20 seeds. plant all. 97 left. I will buy a scythe to increase productivity. 70~80 harvest, so I will buy a scythe and shovel for 60, +25%, which is +18. This will cost work capacity, so it will take 2 years to pay back the money. The rest of the money is invested in sickles, chickens, cotton, and so on. The remaining 18.

Result: Splendid Harvest. Income doubled. The harvest was 14, 19, 21, 29. 146 so far with 40% tool bonus because I bought a sickle, 26 with 3*8 chickens and 10% building bonus, 216% work capacity, and 100% with event bonuses. I have 544 income this year!

Year 7: Rich. medicate. 28. can buy telecommunications or roads! Dosing. 28. can buy telecommunications or roads. Which is better. With roads, the purchase price of seeds goes down, and with communications, the selling price of crops goes up. Yes, even if the seed price goes down, the work of planting a lot of seed is still a hassle, so I will buy communication.250. 274 left. chickens3 are still alive and well, and farm equipment is also alive and well. Should we diversify livestock in case of bird flu? We need a well to keep the pigs. 120 wells bought, 154 remaining. We have 8, 20, 20, 21 seeds, 45 pigs, and we need to sow all kinds of seeds. That leaves 85. 1 pig. That leaves 40. 5 left after buying a sickle.

Result: chicken annihilation event! Oops! All the chickens are dead. The harvest was 10, 21, 24, 29. 130 with +55% tool bonus. 15 for the pigs. I wonder what they are taking for the harvest when no pigs died. With the building bonus +25%, livestock income is 19. pigs were 45, so they'll be in the black the second year. work capacity is 201%, income is 299.

Year 8: Dose 72. 222 remaining. seeds 9, 8, 16, 21. crop characteristics mostly understood. Corn and wheat are almost non-existent. Cotton increases about 25%. Nuts increase about 50% but sometimes decrease. Even though there is almost no increase, the tool bonus +55% plus 200% work capacity means that the increase is 3 times as much. I used to plant all of them 1 at a time, but from now on I will plant them so that the price is roughly the same. I planted two crops, corn and wheat. The investment in crops will be roughly 80. I bought a pig and a chicken each for an investment of 70. Still 81 left. Added all the seeds, 1 each. 27 left.

Result: market price decline event. Overall crop prices fell. What? I grew more crops.... The harvest was 4, 4, 6, 5, livestock 3, 5, multiplied by work capacity241% for a total of 212. Hmmm, I would have been rich if not for the price drop. Well, the livestock didn't die and the farm equipment I invested in wasn't stolen, so I guess I'm just standing on my feet.

Year 9: Medication, 64. keep chickens and pigs, 70. 91 remaining. species 6, 12, 21, 21. purchased at 3, 2, 1, 1 respectively. 7 remaining.

Result: Corn wiped out. Well, not too painful since they are dispersed. Harvest was 0, 15, 23, 21. nuts didn't increase. Crop is 115 after bonuses, and yield from chickens 2 pigs 3 is 76. work capacity is 254% and income is 485 since the eldest son has become an adult in the last year or so.

Year 10: Why don't you grow opium? The event &quot;Why don't you grow opium? Yes, of course I'll grow opium! (Oy) Dosing, 24. 482 left. pull road. 350. 132 left. 10, 15, 22, 20 seeds. 1 of each and 3 poppies planted. 65 left. We can't afford both livestock. I can't afford to buy both livestock. Pigs are 15/45 and chickens are 8/25, so pigs have a slightly better return. I kept the pig. 20 left.

Result: bank failure event. Harvest decreased, cost of living increased. Harvests were 4, 6, 8, 9; poppy 7. 74 total; livestock 3, 5 for a total of 33. 281% multiplied for a total of 301.

Year 11: I get an offer to rent land to build a training camp for a militia group, it says I get 80 in exchange for less fertile land. I wonder what will happen if I accept. I wonder if it is a health hazard. I don't want to take on any extra work since things are going so well. Let's decline. Dosing, 52. 252 remaining. hmmm. Hmmm... 100 left after the usual investment in livestock and seeds. I'll double the investment in plants. Seeds, 10, 19, 21, 18. 4, 2, 2, 2, 2 planted respectively. I bought chickens and pigs. 28 left. Sold the shovel and bought a sickle. 8 left.

Result: market price drop event. Harvest was 5, 8, 8, 5 with tool bonus +60% for a total of 99. Livestock was 3, 5 for a total of 43. Income 398.

Year 12: Medication, 54. no more room for livestock or farming equipment. build Barn. 180. 162 left. seeds 11, 14, 14, 20. 1 of each. 103 left; let's sell the chickens and put a cow in that space. No. Should I sell the pigs to diversify? Well, let's just use the chickens. Chickens sell for 16. I bought a cow. 19 left.

Result: wheat wiped out. Harvest 15, 0, 20, 30. livestock 8, 15, 40. chickens and pigs yield 33% while cattle yield 40%? Building bonus also increased to +55%, so 203 harvest from livestock alone. work capacity has grown to 278%, so income this year is 853.

Year 13: Asked to plant opium again. Plant, plant, plant. Medication, 60....if I build a hospital at 600, I'll still have 225 left.... Built. Plant 10, 7, 22, 20 seeds at 2, 3, 1, 1 respectively. Sell the pigs and buy cows. 66 left. I have 66 left. 66 is not so good. I'll add one seed at a time. 7 left.

Result: market price drop event. Crop total 131 with 4, 4, 9, 4, 7 and livestock total 81 with 3, 5, 13. Income 572.

Year 14: I was asked to plant opium again. I wonder if this event is more likely to occur when I am undertaking it. I accept. Dosing, 39. cheaper or not, 552 or so.... What to do. I have 80 seeds, 80 to sell the pigs and buy cows, that's quite a bit left over. Seeds are 6, 19, 22, 18, bought at 3, 1, 1, 1, 1 respectively. Sell the pigs and buy the cows. 396 left. Sell the sickle and buy a plow. 234 left. 234 left to build another Barn. 54 left to build another Barn.

Result: bank failure event. The farm equipment bonus is +85% and the building bonus is +85%. So the sickle is +15% and the plow is +40%. I guess the building bonus is +30% for Barn. 3, 7, 8, 6, 7 for 3, 5, 13 for income of 566.

Year 15: I have 2 chickens, 3 pigs, and 3 cows. I feel like I can go with just cows because of the diversification with grain. Well, Barn for now. dosing 32. sold sickle to plow. Seeds are 7, 15, 21, 19. 236 left so 7, 4, 3, 3 respectively. 7 extra to carry over.

Result: a good harvest! The harvest was 10, 19, 25, 25 with a farming bonus of +110% for 622, livestock +115% for 389, for a total of 1011 plus 274% and +100% for the bumper crop bonus for a total income of 3781!

Year 16: We can clear this up now, right? But well, let's play one more turn. Build 2 Barns on available land. Plant with 6 nuts, 6 cotton, 3 oats, 3 corn. Dose 35. 3099 left. sell 2 chickens and buy a cow. No, buy an elephant. Sell 2 sickles and turn them into a tractor. 1145 left to buy a &quot;politician's backing&quot;. Buy &quot;harvest insurance. 220 left.

Result: refugee event. All the livestock were stolen. Oh, I wanted to see the profit from the elephants. The farm equipment bonus increased from +110% to +240%. That means the sickle should have been +15%, so the tractor is +80%. The crop yield was 1418 by itself. 4098 in income even though all the livestock were stolen.

Year 17: Sell plow and buy harvester. 2968 left to buy 4 elephants and 4 oxen. 552 left to sow with 3, 3, 6, 6. 552 left to sow in 3, 3, 6, 6. 270 left to sow in 3, 3, 6, 6. 270 left.

Result: a cattle wipeout event. It's ok, I just wanted to see how much the elephants earned. The elephants earned 120. 120 for an investment of 500 is 24%...what? That's even lower than the chickens. So it looks like we have the advantage of being able to cram into a limited space, but the yield is lower. The farm equipment bonus is now +360%, which means the plow is +40%, which means the harvester is +100%. Let's see, the money is now 8629.

Year 18: Okay, let's clear that up. Before I do that, I sent one person to school to see how much it would reflect on the score. I guess buying a school lowers the cost of going to school. But this is my last project purchase, so that's it. I took four elephants and I have 6112 left.

Result: Elephant poaching event w/all elephants killed.

Scores: sustained turn 19: 190 points, year 1 in school: 10 points, 50 points for each project: 300 points, bonus for standing all projects: 500 points. Total: 1000 points. The high score is 29660 points, so you have to ask yourself how many thousands of years I have played.

&lt;hr>
The strategy in this game is, in essence, how to diversify risk. However, diversifying between grain and livestock is not suitable for the early stages of the game. The investment in sheds and other facilities needed to produce livestock is heavy. The diversification needed in the early stages is diversification among seed types and between farming tools and seeds. The investment in each of these should be done before the investment in livestock, which only adds up, because the investment in each will multiply the return. Instead of multiplying 75 to buy 1 chicken and getting +8, buying two sickles for 70 and getting the bonus +30% is a better deal if it yields about 30.

Also, it may be rather important to realize that there are some goods that should be purchased in preference to seeds. If you look at the balance sheet every year, you should be able to see that the most valuable asset in this game is WORK CAPACITY. Cheap corn and wheat will hardly increase, and livestock will take several years to recover, so it is very important that work capacity is greater than 100% and will increase profits.

I'm not sure if it worked for roads and communications.

Well, if you just can't clear it, this kind of diversification will make it much easier for you to clear it. But with this, by the time the family's finances have stabilized, people will say, &quot;I'm too old to have children!&quot; They would say. But if they have children, their work capacity will be reduced because their hands will be occupied with taking care of their children. This increases the level of difficulty.

&lt;body>The first question, the difficulty depends on whether or not you give the meta-information that it's about the four arithmetic operations. My head almost blew up thinking it was a formal grammar. I would like to do a controlled experiment. &lt;/body>

&lt;body> Good evening. I have played that game too. &lt;BR>In case you are wondering, my strategy is&lt;BR>- buy only cotton from the beginning. That way, unless there is a drought event or a series of events that cause crop prices to fall, I will be fine. &lt;br>・For the purchase project, I choose politician's shelter and harvest insurance at the beginning. &lt;br>・Maintain a per capita health level of 60 or higher. （&lt;br>- The health level per capita should be maintained above 60, unless funds are insufficient to cover the cost of the project.) &lt;br>In addition, as a way to get more points, including the disastrous ones,&lt;br> marry as many people as possible. &lt;br> &lt;br>The younger the better, because the person you are marrying should be close to your age. The person you marry should be young, because they are close to that age, and if they are under 25 years old, they can be educated. &lt;br>・It is better to marry a woman. &lt;br>&lt;br>. &lt;br> &lt;br>We should have a child every year without fail. And send them to school until the 10th grade. &lt;br> &lt;br>If there are more than eight children in a family and the family is unable to have more children, send someone to town, even if it is a zero year old baby. Even if it is a zero year old baby. &lt;/body>
