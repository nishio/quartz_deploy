“physically get together and have a good time,” and it became harder to deepen mutual understanding (to know what kind of people we are to each other) among the members.
Can you do something about this?</p>
<p>Unexplored Junior has created a Scrapbox project for the entire project starting in 2021, and we discussed how to make it better by using it.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Have all participants use “their page” in Scrapbox</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduce yourself more and more to the link.</li>
<li>→I can identify people who share common interests with me.</li>
<li>You can add it in stages.
<ul>
<li>I don’t know what to do when they’re all added to the empty state at the same time.</li>
<li>If existing members write their introductions ahead of time and link to each other, newcomers can see them and copy them.</li>
<li>“I’ll warm up the place first.”</li>
<li>The experience of writing your own introduction and discovering connections with seniors who share common interests once you have made the link.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The theory that lots of output by each member is essential for mutual understanding</p>
<ul>
<li>The reverse is easy to imagine, dozens of hours of listening to lectures in silence will not deepen mutual understanding with other members.</li>
<li>How do I get a lot of output?
<ul>
<li>Rules that allow you to write anything and use the page freely.</li>
<li>Just “feel free to do whatever you want” isn’t enough.
<ul>
<li>In the meantime, create a “chat page” so people can write without reading the context.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Would be nice to have specific examples of “anything.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Feel free to write anything you want!</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>You can also add pages as you like</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>e.g., meeting logs for each project, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>If you’re not sure where to write <code>[Chat page]</code>, just click on the <code>[Chat page]</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scrapbox’s “making links will make you happy in the future” is not for those who haven’t actually experienced it.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The concept of “links in Scrapbox” is difficult to understand in the first place.</p>
<ul>
<li>“The person linking doesn’t know the linked page, they discover it by linking to it” is a far cry from the concept of linking in HTML, etc.
<ul>
<li>Words like <a href="./linking" class="internal" data-slug="linking">linking</a>, <a href="./tag" class="internal" data-slug="tag">tag</a>, and <a href="./bracketing" class="internal" data-slug="bracketing">bracketing</a> are being explored, but it’s hard to understand when they’re coined to describe actions you’ve never experienced.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>liken it to an act experienced</p>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>If you use <a href="./link" class="internal" data-slug="link">link</a> as if you were highlighting keywords, pages will be connected to each other and become more interesting!</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>You can make more and more links to other people’s pages even if they are written by other people.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="./Create-a-recommendation-introduction-page" class="internal alias" data-slug="Create-a-recommendation-introduction-page">Create a recommendation introduction page</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rules are minimal.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can’t set a lot of rules and expect people to abide by them.</li>
<li>Increased fear of “am I violating the rules?” inhibits output.</li>
<li>Dr. Shiozawa’s “Do not erase” rule
<ul>
<li>It seems to be the only rule of the Shiozawa Seminar.</li>
<li>Originally hired, but changed.

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The scope of information distribution should be clear.</p>
<ul>
<li>It gives us peace of mind by stating, “What you write here will not be released to the world without your permission.”</li>
<li>Until now, Unexplored Jr. has been communicating the rule that “things related to other creators must not be disclosed without permission.
<ul>
<li>Except in cases where the person has already made the information available to the public and in cases where prior permission has been obtained from the person in question.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regarding “Unexplored Junior created Scrapbox project for the whole from 2021.</p>
<ul>
<li>There was a Scrapbox project to share information among mentors since 2017</li>
<li>Some mentors used individual Scrapbox projects for each individual creator.</li>

<li>
<p>This in itself is something that’s often done with Scrapbox guidance.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Unexpected chaos ensued. I don’t know if it was intentional or by mistake, but a student appeared to edit the name of the page itself, “Where I’m from. A split occurred in pages like “Where I’m from,” “Where I’m from,” and “Where I’m from is Tokyo.”</p>

<p>If you dare to write your name, put your icon on it.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>We did not make any strict editing rules, although there should be some conflicts in the descriptions. We instructed that if there was a conflict, the parties concerned should discuss and resolve it, and that they should create a separate page or list their differing opinions. However, we did not want to start a fight, so we set up an “editorial consultation center” and told people to use it as a court of law when the need arises. But this center was rarely used. The community was self-governing.</p>

<ul>
<li>Challenges of what to do in a situation where participants have mixed IT literacy</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>I would like to have a Scrapbox for all the reaction papers and reports that students submit each time.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The purpose of doing so would be this idea: <a href="./grant-(a-person)-a-degree-of-karma" class="internal alias" data-slug="grant-(a-person)-a-degree-of-karma">grant (a person) a degree of karma</a>.
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>The word “class” means “to impart karma. It is not a “lecture” (to teach righteousness), which is a one-way transmission of information, but a “class”.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Create Scrapbox project with student number.
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Students create a public project in Scrapbox using their student ID number (student number)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>If you write your reactions and reports each time there, the faculty can read them.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>It is easy to access each project by using the student list page based on the student’s student ID number.</li>
