We want to generate a commentary on the principal component axis. The numbers are the coefficients that the question contributes to the first principal component axis. Explain what this axis is.
...
(Data here: [https://gist.github.com/nishio/217ab567c91926df9d5d07c337ce447f](https://gist.github.com/nishio/217ab567c91926df9d5d07c337ce447f) )
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/gpt/icon" alt="gpt.icon" height="19.5"/>
We see that this principal component axis reflects hard-line positions on economic and defense/security policies. In particular, it contributes significantly to economic structural reforms, such as curbing pension and healthcare costs (Q3_2), reducing protection of uncompetitive industries (Q3_3), and continuing monetary easing (Q3_5), as well as strengthening defense capabilities (Q4_1, Q4_2, Q4_3). In addition to this, conservative policies such as visiting Yasukuni Shrine (Q4_6), Henoko relocation (Q4_7), and even maintaining nuclear power plants (Q5_6) also have high coefficients, indicating a conservative yet positive policy orientation toward fiscal consolidation, strengthening military power, and maintaining traditions as a whole. On the other hand, they show opposition to liberal themes such as adherence to the three nuclear principles (Q4_5), married couples (Q4_24), and expansion of LGBTQ rights (Q4_25).
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>In a nutshell, what is the first principal component axis?</p>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/gpt/icon" alt="gpt.icon" height="19.5"/>The first principal component axis is the ‚Äúconservative and hard-line policy orientation‚Äù axis.</p>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>What if we were to label both sides of the positive and negative?</p>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/gpt/icon" alt="gpt.icon" height="19.5"/>It is appropriate to label the positive side as ‚Äúconservative/hardline‚Äù and the negative side as ‚Äúliberal/tolerant‚Äù.</p>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>(Do the same for the second principal component axis)</p>
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/gpt/icon" alt="gpt.icon" height="19.5"/>
This principal component axis contrasts social and economic liberal and conservative positions.
<p>First, items that have a positive contribution to mainly liberal policies appear strongly. For example, Q4_18 ‚ÄúPermanent foreign residents should be allowed local suffrage‚Äù (+5.04) and Q4_17 ‚ÄúForeign workers should be allowed‚Äù (+3.74) strongly show positions in favor of immigration and multiculturalism. In addition, opinions that respect gender equality and diversity, such as Q4_24 ‚ÄúMarried couples should be allowed to have separate family names‚Äù (+3.95) and Q4_25 ‚ÄúSame-sex marriage should be allowed‚Äù (+3.10), are equally liberal-leaning.</p>
<p>On the other hand, conservative policies show up as a negative contribution on this principal component axis. For example, Q4_6 ‚ÄúI want the prime minister to visit Yasukuni Shrine‚Äù (-4.73) and Q4_1 ‚ÄúJapan‚Äôs defense capability should be further strengthened‚Äù (-4.56) indicate traditional conservative positions. Q5_7 ‚ÄúGovernment bond issuance should be curbed‚Äù (-4.84) and Q4_5 ‚ÄúJapan should uphold the three non-nuclear principles‚Äù (+4.45) also indicate a conflict between liberal and conservative viewpoints in economic and defense policies.</p>
<p>The major theme of this principal component axis is support for social liberal policies such as immigration, gender equality, and social welfare, while countering conservative defense and economic stability views.</p>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>In a nutshell, what axis is this principal component axis?</p>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/gpt/icon" alt="gpt.icon" height="19.5"/>This principal component axis is the ‚Äúliberal vs. conservative‚Äù axis.</p>
<p>(E~~<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>)</p>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>The first principal component axis was also liberal and conservative, looking for a different angle.</p>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/gpt/icon" alt="gpt.icon" height="19.5"/>This principal component axis can be thought of as a ‚Äúmarket-based versus government intervention in fiscal and economic policy‚Äù cutoff. Specifically, it represents the conflict between a position that minimizes the role of government and emphasizes market freedom, and a position that actively intervenes by the government through welfare, public services, and fiscal spending.</p>
<p>For example, Q3_1 ‚ÄúHigher consumption tax rate‚Äù (+1.70) and Q4_13 ‚ÄúHigher taxation on people with high income and assets‚Äù (+2.53) are in favor of government intervention, while Q3_4 ‚ÄúPostponement of primary balance‚Äù (-3.27) and Q4_11 ‚ÄúFiscal stimulus should be implemented as an economic measure‚Äù (-2 .59) indicate opposition to the position that government intervention should be restrained.</p>
<p>Thus, this principal component axis can be viewed as ‚Äú<a href="./market-based" class="internal" data-slug="market-based">market-based</a> versus <a href="./government-intervention" class="internal alias" data-slug="government-intervention">government intervention</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<p>impressions</p>
<ul>
<li>[Big government and small government.</li>
<li>It is also possible to think that there is this traditional axis of conflict, or that the people making the survey questions are aware of it, so they include questions about it, and it is selected as the principal component because it has a large variance.
<ul>
<li>But maybe it‚Äôs being reproduced by the political side positioning itself in that conflict.

<li>This analysis is based on the original data is a politician
- <a href="./public-opinion-map" class="internal alias" data-slug="public-opinion-map">public opinion map</a> But since we have gathered data from about 1,000 people, it would be good to use that data to see the differences, since the questions are from party manifestos and the respondents are the general public.
<ul>
<li>Now, if you did a free submission Polis and did the same thing with that data, it might make a difference.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When I first paid attention to the one-line summary, I thought, ‚ÄúBoth sides are now conservative v. liberal, that‚Äôs not funny‚Ä¶‚Äù But after reading the explanations, I realized that the ‚Äúconservative v. liberal‚Äù axis that people think of as one axis of opposition may not actually be one-dimensional. I‚Äôm starting to get the feeling that this is not a one-dimensional axis.
<ul>
<li>In the experiment, I told the second principal component to change it by saying ‚Äúmake it something that isn‚Äôt conservative v.s. liberal‚Äù, but I‚Äôll tell the first principal component side to look for a different cut.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/gpt/icon" alt="gpt.icon" height="19.5"/>To find a different angle, it is useful to find an axis of opposition other than the traditional ‚Äúliberal vs. conservative‚Äù one. Some possible axes include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Economic intervention vs. market-oriented</p>
<ul>
<li>With regard to economic policy, one can set up an axis of positions that emphasize government intervention (e.g., emphasizing welfare and public works, strengthening regulations, etc.) and positions that state that market principles should be followed (e.g., liberalization, promotion of competition, tax cuts, etc.). In this case, raising the consumption tax, strengthening corporate taxes, and maintaining social welfare services would be in the direction of emphasizing government intervention over market principles, while emphasizing competition, deregulation, and fiscal discipline would contribute to the market-oriented side.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tradition-keeping vs. innovation-oriented</p>
<ul>
<li>In terms of socio-cultural values, we can explore the opposition between positions that emphasize traditions and customs and those that promote innovation and diversity. Prayers to Yasukuni Shrine (Q4_6) and the relocation of the Futenma base (Q4_7) contribute to the maintenance of tradition, while advocacy for LGBTQ rights (Q4_25) and married couple surnames (Q4_24) are indicators of an innovation orientation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>National Security vs. Human Rights and Individual Liberties</p>
<ul>
<li>It could be centered on issues related to defense and security and issues related to individual rights and human rights. For example, the axis of conflict is between security-oriented positions such as enemy base attacks and defense buildup (Q4_2, Q4_1) and the emphasis on local suffrage for permanent foreign residents (Q4_18) and individual privacy (Q4_19).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>centralized versus decentralized power</p>
<ul>
<li>We can also find an axis in terms of whether the central government should take the lead or emphasize local and citizen autonomy with regard to political decision-making. Centralization is emphasized in state-led measures such as fiscal and defense policies, while decentralization contributes to local participation and regionally driven policies (e.g., Q4_18, Q4_24).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By examining these axes, we may discover structures other than ‚Äúliberal vs. conservative.‚Äù</p>
