<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/gpt/icon" alt="gpt.icon" height="19.5"/>That is correct. Even if the Chinese system has achieved some success, it is not easy for Japan to emulate it. The reasons for this can be explained in several aspects.</p>
<ol>
<li>difference between political system and governance</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>China is a one-party dictatorship, and the CCP has strong governing power. The policy-making process is also top-down, swift, and coercive. This system allows the government to exercise strong leadership and control over the market and society. Japan, on the other hand, is a parliamentary democracy, where politics is governed by a multiparty system and free elections, and consensus building among various stakeholders is emphasized. Policy making requires a process of debate and coordination, and decision making is not as swift and powerful as in China.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>socio-cultural differences</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>China and Japan have different historical and cultural backgrounds and very different social norms and values. In China, Confucian values and collectivism are deeply rooted, and individual sacrifice for national development and government policy tends to be more acceptable. Japan is also influenced by Confucianism and collectivism, but has stronger individual freedom and democratic values, and is more critical of government control. Therefore, if government intervention and control is tightened as in China, there is likely to be backlash and resistance in Japanese society.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>different stages of economic development</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>China has experienced rapid economic development and urbanization since its reform and opening up, while Japan has already gone through a period of rapid economic growth and has a mature economy. Government-led policies and investments contributed greatly to China’s economic development, but in Japan, with much infrastructure already in place and a mature market economy, a state-led economic strategy similar to China’s may not necessarily be effective. Because of the different levels of economic maturity, policy approaches need to be different accordingly.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li>the difference between geopolitics and diplomacy</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Because of its geopolitical position and size, China has expanded its economic and political presence in Asia and the world. As a key player in global supply chains, China is closely linked economically to many countries, and there is a strong interaction between its domestic economy and foreign influence. Japan, on the other hand, has a stable geopolitical environment and has already established itself as an economically and technologically advanced country. Therefore, it is doubtful that taking an approach like China’s, which focuses on national global strategies, will directly benefit Japan’s national interests.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li>relationship between the legal system and the market</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>In China, the legal system is often modified to flexibly accommodate government policies, and companies operate in a manner consistent with the wishes of the government. While the relationship between the market and the government is very close, Japan’s legal system is designed in a way that respects the autonomy of the market economy and the freedom of companies, and government intervention is limited. For this reason, it is difficult for Japan’s legal system to promote economic development by integrating the government and the market, as is the case in China.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="6">
<li>public values and the difficulty of “<a href="./community-wealth" class="internal alias" data-slug="community-wealth">community wealth</a>”</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Under the slogan of “common wealth,” the Chinese government is implementing policies for wealth redistribution and social equality, while in Japan, “individual rights” and “free markets” are emphasized and the economic freedom of corporations and individuals is protected. To enhance wealth redistribution in Japan, reform of the social security system and the tax system are needed, but this is likely to provoke opposition from businesses and the public, and is difficult to implement in a centralized manner as in China.</li>
</ul>
<p>Due to these differences, it is not realistic for Japan to imitate the Chinese system, and each country will need its own policies and systems tailored to its own characteristics and background.</p>
