In particular, they highlight the role of <a href="./playing" class="internal" data-slug="playing">playing</a> in fostering innovation and creativity in the areas of technology and science. These tweets can be summarized by focusing on the importance of learning through play.</p>
<ul>
<li>ADAPTING TO PARADIGM SHIFTS: The attitude of dismissing new technologies and ideas as “toys” has been seen many times in the past. Technological advances such as the Internet, COBOL, and Z-80 often challenged existing understandings and values. Exposure to and experimentation with new technologies through play can help address these <a href="./paradigm-shifts" class="internal alias" data-slug="paradigm-shifts">paradigm shifts</a> and lead innovation.</li>
<li><a href="./Understanding-through-Experience" class="internal alias" data-slug="Understanding-through-Experience">Understanding through Experience</a>: Building model airplanes and playing with radio-controlled airplanes are important ways to gain a deeper understanding of the basic theories of aeronautical design. Through hands-on experience, students can experience the physical principles and constraints behind the theory in a way that cannot be obtained from textbooks alone.</li>
<li>Creativity and Solution Seeking: The experiences gained through play provide “<a href="./drawers" class="internal" data-slug="drawers">drawers</a> for finding creative solutions to unknown problems that are not found in textbooks. By making many attempts through play, students learn from their mistakes and promote more flexible and innovative thinking.</li>
<li>Application in Practice: Skills and knowledge acquired through play are directly applied to solving complex real-world problems. The ability to go beyond the “right” answers in textbooks, as in the design of the Honda Jet, to find and implement unique solutions is rooted in the deep understanding and experience gained through play and experimentation.</li>
<li>Gap with Social Valuation: Unfortunately, abilities acquired through play are not always valued within business organizations. Cultures that emphasize textbook knowledge and methods tend to undervalue the creativity and flexibility gained through play. However, it is important to recognize and promote the value of this kind of learning through play for long-term innovation and growth.</li>
</ul>
<p>Learning through play provides valuable insights and skills that cannot be gained from textbooks or traditional education alone. These experiences not only foster individual creativity, but also provide the foundation for technological advancement and innovation throughout society.</p>

<p>sshinohe: Whenever I tell people about the importance of model airplane experience in becoming a high-level airplane designer, there are always people who vehemently object. It may be a complex, but I think the secret to a meaningful life is to realize that you can’t do what you were born to do.</p>
