The game setting of VC itself is such that you have to be an evil to win, and choosing the best move naturally leads to the conclusion that it is better to cheat students by taking advantage of the information gap. I think it is very important to choose which game to play in life.</p>

I don’t think I want to invest in a startup that can be easily fooled by VC’s in this era of low information access costs and the information gap between VC’s and investors can be easily closed.

VC is a game in which you are at a disadvantage if you don’t gain credibility in the long run, so I wonder if VCs who “take advantage of the information gap and invest in students at unfair value” will have a hard time surviving.
Unlike a regular scam, on top of paying out money, the company has to grow to make a return,</p>

It’s also true that there are EVIL investors out there who will keep you unaware of your options, prevent you from choosing, or isolate you. So entrepreneurs need to have a trusted advisor.

At the same time, telling the company that they cannot raise funds due to lack of progress in development will prevent the company from calling for a change of representatives.

I’ll say, “I’m not going to be a representative. If it fails, there will only be rumors that will soon disappear, and if it goes to court, it will only be an issue between the corporation and the representative. You can aim for maximum return with minimum risk.</p>

<ul>
<li>Student communities are replaced after a few years</li>
<li>Rumors of people fade like 75 days, so there is little chance for new people to know about them.</li>
<li>Evil side goes to places where there are less rumors about themselves like that (young people/rural areas).</li>

<p>kensuu: In this era when the cost of information access is so cheap that the VC information gap can be quickly bridged…
<a href="https://x.com/YoshifumiSeki/status/1812615021635182671" class="external">YoshifumiSeki<svg aria-hidden="true" class="external-icon" style="max-width:0.8em;max-height:0.8em;" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><path d="M320 0H288V64h32 82.7L201.4 265.4 178.7 288 224 333.3l22.6-22.6L448 109.3V192v32h64V192 32 0H480 320zM32 32H0V64 480v32H32 456h32V480 352 320H424v32 96H64V96h96 32V32H160 32z"></path></svg></a> “Startups that do not have access to this kind of information are of little value” is a fact, but I think it is a bit too much in the structure of society that so much praise is given to startups. I hope that some kind of safety net or support will be created by the self-cleansing action of the VC industry.
I don’t know about “<a href="https://x.com/YoshifumiSeki/status/1812615666073235733" class="external">YoshifumiSeki<svg aria-hidden="true" class="external-icon" style="max-width:0.8em;max-height:0.8em;" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><path d="M320 0H288V64h32 82.7L201.4 265.4 178.7 288 224 333.3l22.6-22.6L448 109.3V192v32h64V192 32 0H480 320zM32 32H0V64 480v32H32 456h32V480 352 320H424v32 96H64V96h96 32V32H160 32z"></path></svg></a> “access costs are very low”, I don’t see VC’s criticizing each other outwardly, and entrepreneurs don’t share certain information if they are close to each other. I don’t think entrepreneurs share a certain amount of information with other entrepreneurs if they are good friends, but I don’t think they do it much because it’s risky to talk about bad news about VC firms.</p>
