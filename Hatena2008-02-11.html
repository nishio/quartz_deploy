*1202705579*I'm in the company.
I have to take the Class B fire prevention management course tomorrow, but I don't know where to take it, so I came out to check it out.
I searched the bulletin board and when I couldn't find it, I found it in front of my desk on paper.

- 9:20-17:00 Late arrivals and early departures are invalid.
- Located at the firefighting technology testing and training center next to Akihabara UDX
- Sharp pencil, driver's license, and 1500 yen are required. You must buy the textbook for 1,500 yen and get a receipt in the company's name.
- They have an exam at the end.

It gives a sense of the times. The camera is huge w

It seems that podcasts need to be set to sync separately.

And somehow it worked, but it's not scripted on the iPod nano.

>>
When you play ESL or BusinessEnglish on your ipod touch, you will be surprised to see the entire script of the conversation on the screen.
&lt;&lt;
I thought it might not be a script because nano also has a screen, but the world is not that naive.

Hmmm... I wonder if I should buy an iPod touch when I have an iPod nano...

-----

PS: I was able to see the script! You can see it by pressing the middle button several times on the song display screen!

*1202716450* I think I'll buy some big sunglasses.
Fully protected.
I also feel that if I cover my eyes, I'll be fine even if the bird flu breaks out. But that's just a feeling.

The back of iPod nano has a mirror finish, so it can be used as a mirror.

*1202718016* Continued: iPod nano
When I connect it to my PC and it doesn't respond, it hangs up! It won't even turn off.

Reset seems to be a long press in the middle and on top.

-----

I have &quot;downloaded all&quot; about 4 English language podcasts and put them in. But I still have 5 gigs left over. As technology advances, the capacity of digital devices increases rapidly, but human processing power does not. I think it is time to seriously study the implantation of electronic devices in newborns, as a science fiction fan.

-----

35 Business English Podcasts, 9 CNET News, 109 ESL podcasts, and 20 IT Conversation.
The pronunciation of ESL is indeed very laid-back. To be honest, it feels a little sluggish. But I feel that a lot of what is spoken is designed for learners of English as a second language, and is designed for those who are unfamiliar with English-speaking cultures.

You explain something like &quot;mess is an unclean, unorganized, disorganized state like that&quot; in very slow English. He explains the word in very slow English like &quot;s,t,a,l,l is a small area...&quot; He explains the words like that. Ho. It's one thing to listen to fast-paced English, but I think it's also good to concentrate on listening to slow-paced English like this.

Lately, I've come to think that my ideals are too high compared to my abilities, so I'll go easy on myself here and start with ESL.

-----

ESL, he said, is a system where you read at a very slow speed at first, and then read again at a normal speed after explaining the words in English. I thought it was too slow at first, but I guess that's what they meant.

-----

I was listening to it on the train on my way home and it was interesting. If you listen to a streaming video without the phase of looking up unfamiliar words, it is difficult to improve your vocabulary, and if you listen to an audio file that explains words in Japanese, your English brain inevitably breaks off at that point. With this program, the English words are explained in English, so it's rather fun to have a moment of &quot;Oh, that's that one! It's rather fun. And even if I already know the word, I can still think, &quot;Toilet paper is white, soft, rolled around a core, and used to clean my skin after I've done my business.

*1202719945*I'm leaving because it's cold.
I could just turn on the heater, but I feel it is a waste to heat a room that is many times larger than my own room for myself alone. I hear it costs a lot to heat a room.

*1202748692*I'm hungry.
For some reason, I'm super hungry.
I wonder if it was digested because I ate soba around 6:00.
I can't eat anything after 9pm because I have a rule about not taking in calories after 9pm. I'm starving.... I wish there was a food with no calories at all for times like this. Agar?

*1202755694*About Debussy
The scale of the event was too large for me to understand what it was about, so I ended up going through it.
In the end, we don't even have a proper grasp of who says and speaks.
How can people understand a conference that requires pre-registration when it's that big and runs 5 parallel...
