Not good for use with voice. It is fatal that important keywords are not recognized and are collapsed.
Then I switched to text input and realized that “I want to use it with voice” is not the same as “I want to use it with voice input”.

<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>I would like to test voice input because there are quite a few people who say, “Oh, it would be nice if we could use this system with voice.</p>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What type of audio is that?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Right now I’m taking a walk and using my AirPods for voice input.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What type of voice input is that?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>It’s a bit annoying to start voice input because now you have to tap the voice input button on the keyboard every time you want to start voice input.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>Is there anything else about that voice input?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Also, this chat storm…
I’m trying to send it to you, but I can’t.
When I press the enter key, it sends the message, but it doesn’t seem to recognize the characters entered when the enter key is pressed in the voice input, so I have to quit the voice input every now and then.
It’s a hassle to have to long the man-male button.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>How do you know its voice input?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Aside from voice input, I don’t read out the response from the chatbot now, so I have to look at the screen, which is a hassle.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>Where is that voice input located?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>I tap the voice input button on the keyboard every single time.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>Where is that voice input?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>It is a standard feature of the iPhone

<li>What does this voice input look like?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>I think people who want to use voice input for e-mail probably envision using it as if they were having a conversation with a human, but in the field, you have to tap a button to input voice data and read what appears in the rain by hand, so it seems a little less smooth.

<li>Where is this audio located?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Maybe the destination needs to be audio, too.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>How do you know its audio?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>I think I heard you say you’d like to see the audio of the response, and you’d like to give an audio answer to that.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What does that audio sound like?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>I guess they want to communicate with other humans as if they were having a voice conversation, which I’m not really interested in.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What is it that you value?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>So, what I value is that the output of text remains for six minutes, and by putting it in through my eyes, it disappears the moment I say it out loud, whereas with voice, it disappears the moment I say it out loud, but with text, it remains in my eyes for two days, and that synergistic effect is beneficial to human intelligence. I think I feel that the synergistic effect is beneficial to human intelligence by the fact that the text stays in my eyes for a while. I think that the synergistic effect of voice input is that it is beneficial to go to the early morning of memory, and that is what I feel the value of. This synergistic effect is beneficial to human intelligence, and I think they feel that it is valuable.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What should happen with that voice input?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>In fact, when a human being coaches with this technique, he or she repeats back what the other person has said, and it functions as a mechanism to input what was said into the head again, rather than cutting it off the moment it was said. There are two functions that you can get.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What needs to happen to voice input for that to happen?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>In fact, when a human coachee uses this technique, he or she repeats back what the other person has said, and this works as a mechanism to input what was said into the head again, rather than cutting it off at the moment it was said, but that is a function that is easily available if you use text rather than sound, unless you have already used voice input. It is a feature that can be easily obtained if you type in text rather than sound.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>Can that audio do it?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>When something like this happens, the flow state is interrupted, and you can’t immerse yourself in the object of post-thought, which is a big disadvantage, so I think it’s better to say that voice cannot be used in the field.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>Where does the audio come from?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Text input from here. To summarize so far, voice input/output works negatively for the intrinsic value of this tool, because ”
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What should happen to that audio?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>This is important because “what you output is logged as text, and primary memory is augmented by putting the log on the screen through your eyes,” and when a live person actually uses this technique orally, he or she repeats back what the other person says.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What needs to happen to the voice for that to happen?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>During that repeat-back, the latest care should be taken not to change the words used by the other party. The voice input/output must be able to repeat what the user has said without making mistakes.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>Can voice input do that?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>The technology at the moment is not even close. Important keywords like “log” and “short-term memory enhancement” are all over the place when typed by voice.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>Where is that audio?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>It’s better to just repeat back the recording without applying voice recognition.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What is the relationship between its voice and voice input?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Yes, that’s it. When a user wants to “communicate by voice,” what is really needed is not to recognize the voice and string it together. It is more likely to be correct to give feedback as it is spoken, or to find and cut out the keyword part from the inflection and so on as it is spoken.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>Is that voice the same as voice input? Is it different?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>I assumed they were the same, but they weren’t!

<li>What happens to the voice input when this voice

<p>Yes, I know that I don’t feel the value of voice input for the time being, but what I do feel the value of is that the output as text remains for 6 minutes, and by putting it in through my eyes, it disappears the moment I say it out loud if it’s voice, but if it’s text, it stays in my eyes for a while for 2 days. I think that the synergistic effect is beneficial for human intelligence by saying that the text stays for a while in the second day. What I feel the value of is that the output of text remains for six minutes, and by putting it in through my eyes, it disappears the moment I speak it out loud if it is voice, but if it is text, it remains for a while on the second day, which makes it possible for human beings to have a synergistic effect on their memory at one o’clock in the early morning.

<li>What happens to the voice during this voice input?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>To string by voice input prevents smooth voice interaction in the current system. If you want to do it by voice, the system should repeat back only by voice and not look at the screen.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What is between that voice and voice input?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>There should be keyword extraction in audio form before audio is turned into strings!

<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>If you’re communicating by voice, you can’t see the log screen, so you need to repeat back to the voice.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>Is that audio the same as repeat? Is it different?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Different. With text, the log serves the function of repeat back.

<li>What happens to the repeat during this audio?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>I’d think it would take longer to get an audio repeat back than it would to look at the log.

<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>You might want to interject and rephrase.

<li>What is between this audio and the repeat?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>I’d suggest removing filler like “uh” or something like that instead of repeating back the whole recording.
