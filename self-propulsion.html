- Self-drivenness goes beyond spontaneity and independence, and refers to the ability to set up the environment and resources on one's own to achieve one's goals.
- To develop self-drive, it is important to build up experience, intrinsic motivation, and to create an environment conducive to self-drive.
- Self-drivenness is shaped not only by the nature and ability of the individual, but also by the appropriate environment and resource management skills.

This Twitter thread discusses the concept of self-drivenness from a variety of perspectives. Self-drivenness is seen as more than just spontaneity or independence, and refers to the ability to set up one's own environment and resources and use the necessary skills and know-how to advance toward a goal in problem solving and project execution. Examples are given of children who are spontaneous but not self-driven, and the importance of setting deadlines for themselves and pushing themselves to achieve results.
<p>It also emphasizes that self-drive is not just a skill or ability, but also the importance of personal disposition, intrinsic motivation, and the ability to create an environment conducive to self-drive. People who are self-driven are also considered to have the ability to successfully build an environment that capitalizes on their strengths and covers their weaknesses.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the viewpoint that accumulating experience in accomplishing something on one’s own is essential for fostering self-drivenness and that the ability to be self-sufficient and to choose one’s environment and tasks contribute to self-drivenness is also presented. On the other hand, even those who are considered highly self-driven sometimes lose their direction, and the importance of changing direction at such times is pointed out.</p>
<p>Throughout, there seems to be a shared understanding that self-drivenness is a complex characteristic that is formed as a result of the individual’s ability, nature, and interaction with the external environment, all of which are important for the individual to effectively advance toward his or her goals.</p>

<p>Being able to run on your own is likely to include something about being able to manage everything, including the necessary environment, resources, and know-how, in addition to being able to move on your own initiative and be proactive.</p>

I used to think that it was up to the individual, but after learning more about coaching, I have come to realize that the surrounding environment is also important. In order to demonstrate self-driving ability, it is necessary to create an environment that facilitates self-driving.</p>

Self-running tends to be talked about like a skill, like “self-motivation,” but people who are said to be highly self-motivated actually seem to have it as their own nature, so “self-motivation” is probably closer.
A person who has an engine driven by intrinsic rather than extrinsic motivation.</p>

While I think it is closely related to self-regulated learning, what I am personally wondering now is, “Isn’t it possible to be ‘self-driven’ because you choose your environment and tasks well?” “Do you sacrifice something in yourself or allocate resources to other people or things in order to achieve self-drive?” These are the questions.

<p>nishio: We often hear words like “spontaneity” and “independence” in the world, but listening to various discussions in the unexplored community, statements like “we hired you because you seem to have the ability to run on your own” come up, so I wondered if what really matters is “self-drive. I thought, “What is really important is “self-drivenness.</p>

If we were to speak of it as an ability, I think we would describe it as “self-propelled ability. In any case, the question is whether there is also “self-propulsion” that is shaped by the environment and circumstances in which the individual is placed. (continued)</p>
