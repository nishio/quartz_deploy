<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/GPT-4/icon" alt="GPT-4.icon" height="19.5"/>Current approaches to group understanding and decision-making do not work well in large scale situations, especially given the distorted incentives of the modern attention economy:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Thoughtful deliberation does not scale: if a thousand ‚Äútown halls‚Äù attempt to speak and listen at the same time, the result is just noise. On the other hand, if each person speaks in turn, it can take days; with a million people, this can take decades on a single issue, and most people affected by a policy or conflict cannot speak or listen in a meaningful way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People have feelings of powerlessness and neglect: people do not feel empowered to express their perspectives and do not feel that their perspectives and experiences are reflected. This leads to a loss of trust and causes people to leave the governance and conflict resolution process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Valuable insights are missed: ‚Äúknowledge keys‚Äù - information, ideas, and insights that can help overcome deepening conflicts - are often missed. These often occur closest to the people with the least reach through standard channels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Divisiveness is better than common ground: causing conflict is far more rewarding than identifying and enhancing common ground.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, with advances in connectivity, machine learning, and democratic practices, we may be able to overcome some of these challenges with ‚Äúsimultaneous communications that scale.‚Äù</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="./Collective-Response-Systems" class="internal alias" data-slug="Collective-Response-Systems">Collective Response Systems</a> are designed to allow groups of any scale to make creative decisions (e.g., a decision to develop an optional space for participants). They are designed to come as close as possible to one version of the ‚Äúdemocratic ideal.‚Äù That is, in group decisions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every person has the ability to react from his or her own point of view.</li>
<li>All people‚Äôs responses will be heard and incorporated.</li>
<li>The response that best represents the group is chosen.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collective response systems focus on decision-making and deliberation, and aim to avoid the attention-seeking behavior rewarded in entertainment and politically focused communication environments (e.g., social media). They allow for large scale simultaneous communication. They also treat a population as a single agent and allow it to interact with other population agents.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>2 Structure and Process</p>
<ul>
<li>2.1 Input: Groups and Prompts
<ul>
<li>There are two inputs to the system:
<ul>
<li>Prompt that is a question or something to be completed.</li>
<li>Then there is the group, a collection of participants.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2.2 Outputs: representative distillation of the evaluation and, if necessary, raw and/or derived data</li>
<li>The core output of such a population response system is an approximation or aggregation of responses that makes sense and typically conveys the ‚Äúbest‚Äù response. This is most commonly referred to as representative distillation.
<ul>
<li><a href="./representative-distillation" class="internal alias" data-slug="representative-distillation">representative distillation</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The definition of ‚Äúbest‚Äù is largely open to interpretation, but is constrained by the key principles described below. For example, while the response with the most approvals may be considered the best, other approaches may be used instead (e.g., ranking based on shared awareness as perceived by the Polis group or bridging as implemented by the Twitter community notes)
<ul>
<li><a href="./Birdwatch" class="internal" data-slug="Birdwatch">Birdwatch</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Outputs such as ‚Äúbest response‚Äù may also be used in downstream systems, including future population response processes described below.</li>
<li>In addition, derived data may be output to help reflect group reactions and evaluations. For example, a system such as <a href="./Polis" class="internal" data-slug="Polis">Polis</a> can show participants how issues and people are positioned on a map of perspectives. Finally, raw data, such as reactions and ratings, may be output for further processing and analysis.</li>
</ul>
<p>2.3 Process: reaction, evaluation, distillation</p>
<ul>
<li>The processes facilitated by a collective response system are called collective response processes. Such a process consists of three sub-processes:
<ul>
<li>Reaction sub-process: everyone in the group (optionally) responds to the prompt.</li>
<li>Evaluation sub-process: everyone in the group evaluates part of the response (possibly selected by the system).</li>
<li>Distillation sub-process: the system approximates and/or aggregates the evaluation of each reaction to produce a useful output.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Putting it all together, the collective response process for, say, 5,000 people in a city participating in a collective dialogue on education policy might look like this
<ul>
<li>RESPONSE: Participants are asked, ‚ÄúWhat are the most important educational challenges facing our cities?‚Äù they are asked. They can respond with a short answer - a response; in systems like Polis or Remesh, these responses are usually short, e.g., one to three sentences.</li>
<li>Evaluation: Participants are assigned a ‚Äúvoting task‚Äù. For example, to evaluate whether they agree or disagree with a response.</li>
<li>Distillation: the system can then show participants the most approved response or the response with the most common ground across (political) divisions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Such a process can be executed in 5 minutes (e.g., simultaneously with Remesh) or in days or weeks (e.g., asynchronously with Polis, iteratively).</li>
</ul>
<p>3 Characteristics and Principles</p>
<ul>
<li>Key Characteristics. For a system to be a collective response system, the following characteristics must be met
<ul>
<li>(1) Participant agency: participants themselves can propose responses and are not limited to a fixed set - this might be called a ‚Äúparticipatory perspective‚Äù.</li>
<li>(2) Parallel communication: not all participants need to talk to or listen to all other participants. This may depend on methods such as bracketing (i.e., roughly analogous to <a href="./breakout-groups" class="internal alias" data-slug="breakout-groups">breakout groups</a>) or <a href="./evocative-inference" class="internal alias" data-slug="evocative-inference">evocative inference</a> (i.e., a way to approximate how a participant would rate all responses given some ratings).</li>
<li>(3) Representative distillation: there is some mechanism to approximate and/or aggregate the inputs of all participants to obtain a rating that is representative of the whole. The resulting distilled output (which may include the output of the ‚Äúmap‚Äù) is shared with the participants.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Key Principles. In addition, the design of a collective response system must be designed to meet the following key principles in order to accommodate the democratic ideals described earlier
<ul>
<li>(1) Group Orientation: System design prioritizes supporting/understanding groups and their decisions over supporting/understanding individual people and their decisions.</li>
<li>(2) Prompt-oriented: System design prioritizes the creation of outputs that best respond to input prompts over other goals (e.g., entertainment).</li>
<li>(3) Deliberative orientation: the system design favors preferences and incentives that support participants‚Äô understanding of potential options and others‚Äô perspectives on them over other goals (e.g., engagement).
<ul>
<li>For example, this might include identifying common ground, surfacing insights, self-reflection on the collective experience, and endorsing actions such as perspective mapping.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(4) Fair Deliberation Orientation: The system design must ensure that all participants are deliberated fairly - all responses are given a chance to be heard by the collective as best they may be considered.14</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>While the characteristics are binary and clear, the principles are more open to interpretation; further philosophical, empirical, and normative work may be needed to further refine these principles.</li>
</ul>
<p>3.1 Collective Dialogue</p>
<ul>
<li>A collective dialogue system (CDS) is a collective response system with a form of iteration or feedback loop in which participants repeatedly interact with the system to create new responses based on previous outputs (to the same or new prompts). The term collective dialogue can be used to abbreviate the collective dialogue process (the process facilitated by the CDS).</li>
<li>Such an interactive process allows for further exploration of the details, motivations, and obstacles to the most promising solutions. It can also be used for other arbitrary meaning making tasks and iterative decision making tasks.
<ul>
<li>The earlier example, ‚ÄúWhat are the most important educational challenges facing our cities?‚Äù Consider the following. If this is part of a group dialogue, after the initial answer, a follow-up question might be posed in a new group response process with the same participants based on the responses deemed most representative.</li>
<li>This might take the form of asking, ‚ÄúWhat do you think is the best solution to address that challenge?‚Äù It might take the form of asking, ‚ÄúWhat do you think is the best solution to address the issue?</li>
</ul>
</li>
