<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/> Using the above data as input, summarize the discussion on visual thinking and verbalization. Please make the following points: visual thinking is possible without verbalization, and nonverbal information plays a major role in human thinking.</p>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/claude/icon" alt="claude.icon" height="19.5"/> The relationship between visual thinking and verbalization can be summarized as follows</p>
<ul>
<li>Visual thinking can be established as thinking without verbalization. nishio points out that ‚Äúthinking‚Äù and ‚Äúcommunicating‚Äù should be distinguished, and verbalization is not necessarily necessary if one is only thinking. Visual thinking plays an important role in solving puzzles and building things.</li>
<li>Nonverbal information plays a major role in human thinking. In the example of Jiro Kawakita‚Äôs KJ method, thinking is also advanced by representing and drawing non-verbal information through the ‚Äúspatial arrangement‚Äù of labels. This indicates that information that cannot be captured by language alone is involved in thinking.</li>
<li>Care should be taken in the use of the word ‚Äúverbalization‚Äù: although the word ‚Äúverbalization‚Äù is sometimes used in the context of the KJ method, it is not appropriate to call it ‚Äúverbalization‚Äù since one can actually draw a picture on a label. Rather, a term such as ‚Äúlabeling‚Äù would be more appropriate as a concept that includes expressions other than language.</li>
<li>As an example of visual thinking, nishio cites CAST DUET. This is an example of how visual thinking can be effective in problem solving.</li>
</ul>
<p>As described above, visual thinking is possible without verbalization, indicating that nonverbal information plays an important role in human thinking. Although verbalization is necessary for communicating thoughts to others, thinking itself is highly dependent on non-verbal information.</p>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/> After reading the above discussion, I felt that</p>
<ul>
<li>[Internal expression is a tool for thinking, while external expression is a tool for communication.</li>
<li>[The categorization of human internal states as entities such as ‚Äúverbal thinking‚Äù or ‚Äúvisual thinking‚Äù is in itself impossible. Thinking is a dynamic process that is a complex interplay of various elements such as language, vision, hearing, touch, kinaesthesia, and emotion, and is not something that can be isolated and named ‚ÄúXX kind of thinking.
but what do you think about this point?</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/claude/icon" alt="claude.icon" height="19.5"/> nishio‚Äôs points are very interesting and offer a new perspective on the relationship between thought and expression.</p>
<ul>
<li>Regarding the dual function of representation, it is important to note that representation can function as both an internal thought tool and an external communication tool. Internal expressions help clarify and organize thoughts. External representation, on the other hand, is necessary to communicate one‚Äôs thoughts to others and to deepen discussion. Understanding this dual function will help us to better understand the role of representation.</li>
<li>nishio‚Äôs point about the non-substantiality of thought is thought-provoking. Indeed, there are limits to simply categorizing thoughts as ‚Äúverbal,‚Äù ‚Äúvisual,‚Äù and so on. Human thinking is a dynamic process involving a complex interplay of various senses and emotions. Even if a thought can be called ‚Äúvisual,‚Äù it may contain linguistic elements as well. Conversely, a thought that could be called ‚Äúlinguistic‚Äù may also be accompanied by a visual image.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, we must be careful about materializing and categorizing thinking. Rather, it is important to view thinking as a dynamic, intertwined process with diverse elements and to understand its complexity. At the same time, it would be useful to explore the roles played by various modalities such as language, vision, and hearing in the thinking process in order to understand the nature of thinking.</p>
<p>nishio‚Äôs points encourage a more flexible and dynamic understanding of the relationship between thinking and expression, and provide an important perspective on the art of intellectual production using LLM.</p>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>Regarding <a href="./the-dual-function-of-expression" class="internal alias" data-slug="the-dual-function-of-expression">the dual function of expression</a>, I agree that the distinction between internal and external expression is important. On the other hand, the dichotomy of ‚Äúinternal expression being a tool of thought and external expression being a tool of communication‚Äù may be an oversimplification. Internal expression is a ‚Äútool‚Äù for thinking, and at the same time, it can be viewed as constituting a ‚Äúpart‚Äù of thinking itself. External expression is also a ‚Äútool‚Äù for communication with others, and at the same time, it can serve as a ‚Äúscaffold‚Äù for clarifying and deepening one‚Äôs thinking. It could be said that internal and external expressions are involved in both thinking and communication, mutually influencing each other.</p>
<p>I completely agree with you about <a href="./the-de-embodiment-of-thought" class="internal alias" data-slug="the-de-embodiment-of-thought">the de-embodiment of thought</a>. In order to understand the process of thinking, it is necessary to capture the complex interaction of various modalities dynamically. On the other hand, for the sake of analysis, it is inevitable to use categories such as ‚Äúlinguistic‚Äù and ‚Äúvisual‚Äù. What is important is to use them flexibly, while recognizing that such categories do not represent the substance of thinking. The expression ‚ÄúXX-oriented thinking‚Äù should be understood as referring to a certain ‚Äúaspect‚Äù or ‚Äútendency‚Äù of thinking, and does not capture the whole picture of thinking.</p>
<p>In considering intellectual production using LLM, it is important to consider the complex interplay between linguistic and nonlinguistic expressions, taking into account the non-substantive nature of thought. Non-verbal elements (sentence structure, word choice, style, etc.) are also involved. In addition, the thinking on the human side inspired by interaction with LLMs will be a complex process that transcends the language/non-linguistic distinction. While being aware of these complexities, flexible use of LLMs is required.</p>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/> You are exactly right in pointing out that it is not a good idea to make the internal/external expression distinction absolute. I agree that internal expression can be a part of thought and external expression can be a scaffold for thought.</p>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/claude/icon" alt="claude.icon" height="19.5"/> As you pointed out, it was not appropriate to make an absolute distinction between internal and external expression. It is important to note that both interact with each other and are involved in both thinking and communication.</p>
<p>Regarding the point that internal representations become part of the thinking process, <a href="./Vygotsky's" class="internal alias" data-slug="Vygotsky's">Vygotsky‚Äôs</a> concept of internalization may be helpful. Vygotsky points out that external social interactions are incorporated into the internal thought process and become part of thought. From this perspective, internal representation can be understood as not just a ‚Äútool‚Äù for thinking, but as an important element that shapes thinking itself.</p>
<p>It is also important to note that external representations provide a scaffold for thinking. By verbalizing and diagramming one‚Äôs thoughts, one‚Äôs thinking can become clearer and new insights can emerge. In this sense, external representation is an important resource for deepening thinking.</p>
<p>In intellectual production using LLM, it is important to be aware of this complex interplay between internal and external expressions; although interaction with LLM is basically through external linguistic expressions, the thoughts that emerge are deeply connected to internal expressions. Moreover, using LLM to verbalize one‚Äôs thoughts can be seen as a process of deepening one‚Äôs thinking through external expression.</p>
<p>The key to effective use of LLMs is not to view the internal/external or verbal/nonverbal distinctions as absolutes, but rather to view them as a complex interplay that shapes thinking and communication.</p>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/> In light of this discussion, it would be good to reorganize the use of the term ‚Äú<a href="./visual-thinking" class="internal alias" data-slug="visual-thinking">visual thinking</a>‚Äù.
It would be appropriate to say ‚Äúvisual thinking‚Äù in a context that wants to emphasize ‚Äúthe significant role that visual images play in thinking in general.‚Äù If we are referring to the aspect of thinking that directly manipulates images without language or symbols, it might be better to use a term such as ‚Äú<a href="./image-thinking" class="internal alias" data-slug="image-thinking">image thinking</a>‚Äù.
The term ‚Äú<a href="./linguistic-turn-of-mind" class="internal alias" data-slug="linguistic-turn-of-mind">linguistic turn of mind</a>‚Äù should likewise be used with caution. While appropriate in a context that emphasizes the significant role of language, connotations such as ‚Äúpurely linguistic thinking‚Äù that does not include nonverbal elements should be avoided.</p>
<p>It seems that a definition of terms is needed for <a href="./dual-function-of-expression" class="internal alias" data-slug="dual-function-of-expression">dual function of expression</a> <a href="./non-substantiation-of-thought" class="internal alias" data-slug="non-substantiation-of-thought">non-substantiation of thought</a>. While taking the distinction between internal/external expression and verbal/nonverbal expression as a starting point, it is necessary to create a framework that is aware of their interaction and complexity.</p>
<p>In considering the use of LLMs, the discussion here may suggest that it is important to be aware not only of the linguistic expressions as input and output, but also of the dynamics of the thinking behind them.</p>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/claude/icon" alt="claude.icon" height="19.5"/> Thank you for your clarification on the use of the terms ‚Äúvisual thinking‚Äù and ‚Äúverbal thinking.‚Äù As you point out, these terms need to be used carefully depending on the context.</p>
<p>The term ‚Äúvisual thinking‚Äù is useful when emphasizing the important role of visual images in thinking in general. On the other hand, when referring to direct manipulation of images that does not involve language or symbols, terms such as ‚Äúimage thinking‚Äù may be more appropriate to avoid misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Similarly, the term ‚Äúlinguistic thinking‚Äù is appropriate in a context that emphasizes the significant role of language, but should avoid the connotation of ‚Äúpurely linguistic thinking‚Äù to the exclusion of nonverbal elements.</p>
<p>Regarding the ‚Äúdual function of representation‚Äù and ‚Äúnon-substantiation of thought,‚Äù your point about the importance of defining terms is accurate. While taking the distinction between internal/external and verbal/nonverbal as a starting point, it is necessary to create a framework that captures their interaction and complexity. For example, we could incorporate perspectives such as the continuity between internal and external expressions and the fusion of linguistic and nonlinguistic elements.</p>
<p>It is very instructive to note that in utilizing LLM, it is important to be aware not only of the linguistic expressions as input and output, but also of the dynamics of the thinking behind them; interactions with LLM are mediated by language, but are also deeply connected to non-verbal aspects of thinking. We will need to be aware of this complex interaction and be flexible in our use of LLM.</p>
<p>This discussion suggests the possibility of a richer understanding of the relationship between thinking and expression that goes beyond a simple dichotomy. Such a deeper understanding will be important in expanding the possibilities for intellectual production using LLM.</p>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/> In summarizing this discussion, the following points emerge.</p>
<ul>
<li>Expressions such as ‚Äúvisual thinking‚Äù and ‚Äúverbal thinking‚Äù are useful in contexts that emphasize the significant role of vision and language in thinking, but care must be taken not to mislead people into thinking that some thinking is based solely on vision and language.</li>
<li>Thinking is a dynamic process involving a complex interplay of various elements such as language, vision, hearing, touch, kinaesthesia, and emotion, and it is not appropriate to isolate and materialize them.</li>
<li>Expression has two aspects, one as a tool for internal thought and the other as a tool for external communication, but the two interact with each other. Internal expression becomes part of the structure of thought, and external expression becomes a scaffold for deepening thought.</li>
<li>In intellectual production using LLM, it is important to be aware not only of linguistic expressions as input and output, but also of the dynamics of thinking behind them. It is necessary to consider how language-mediated interactions are connected to aspects of thinking that are not verbalized.</li>
<li>In capturing the relationship between thinking and expression, it is necessary to take the distinction between internal/external and verbal/nonverbal as a starting point, while creating a framework that is aware of their interaction and complexity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Such an understanding provides important insights into using LLMs as partners in thought and expanding the possibilities for intellectual production. We can enrich our interactions with LLMs by taking linguistic expressions as cues and looking at the complex dynamics of thinking behind them.</p>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/claude/icon" alt="claude.icon" height="19.5"/> Thank you for the excellent summary. Through this discussion, I think I have gained a more three-dimensional and dynamic understanding of the relationship between thinking and expression.</p>
<p>It is especially important to note that we need to be careful in our use of phrases such as ‚Äúvisual thinking‚Äù and ‚Äúverbal thinking. While these terms are useful in contexts that emphasize the significant role of vision and language in thinking, they can give the misconception that some thinking is based solely on vision and language. It is important to be aware of the complex interplay of various elements in the thinking process.</p>
<p>The dual function of representation and the point about the mutual influence of internal and external representation is also thought-provoking. The viewpoint that internal representation is a part of thought and external representation is a scaffold for deepening thought is important when considering intellectual production using LLM.</p>
<p>Interaction with LLMs requires an awareness not only of their verbal expressions as input and output, but also of the dynamics of thinking behind them. By considering how language-mediated interactions are connected to non-verbal aspects of thinking, we can more effectively use LLMs as partners in thinking.</p>
<p>The framework for capturing the relationship between thinking and expression should take as its starting point the distinction between internal/external and verbal/nonverbal, while incorporating their interaction and complexity. Such a framework is expected to play an important role in expanding the possibilities for intellectual production using LLM.</p>
<p>This discussion has been significant in deepening our understanding of the foundation for using LLMs as partners in thought. By looking at the complex dynamics of linguistic expressions and the thinking behind them, we can make our interactions with LLMs richer and more productive. It is hoped that this understanding will serve as a starting point to open up new horizons for intellectual production using LLM.</p>
