<p>inheritance tax law</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Article 66 Where a gift or bequest of property is made to an association or foundation without juridical personality with a designated representative or administrator, the said association or foundation shall be deemed to be an individual and gift tax or inheritance tax shall be imposed thereon. In this case, the total amount of the gift tax to be paid by the association or foundation shall be the amount of the gift tax calculated by deeming that the association or foundation acquired the property by gift from only one of the persons who made the gift, for each person who made the gift.
2. The provisions of the preceding paragraph shall apply mutatis mutandis to the case where property is provided for the establishment of an association or foundation as provided in the preceding paragraph.
Ôºì ‚Ä¶
4 The provisions of the preceding three paragraphs shall apply mutatis mutandis where a gift or bequest of property has been made to a juridical person in which equity is not specified, and it is deemed that the gift or bequest will result in an unreasonable decrease in the burden of inheritance tax or gift tax on the relatives of the donor of the gift or bequest and other persons having special relationships prescribed in Article 64(1) with these persons. In this case, the term ‚Äúinheritance tax‚Äù in paragraph (1) shall be deemed to be replaced with ‚Äúinheritance tax‚Äù. In this case, the term ‚Äúassociation or foundation without juridical personality with a designated representative or administrator‚Äù in paragraph (1) shall be deemed to be replaced with ‚Äújuridical person without a designated equity interest,‚Äù the term ‚Äúsaid association or foundation‚Äù with ‚Äúsaid juridical person,‚Äù and the term ‚Äúassociation or foundation‚Äù in paragraphs (2) and (3) with ‚Äújuridical person without a designated equity interest‚Äù.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since the members of a general incorporated association do not have the right to claim distribution of the residual assets, the general incorporated association is a ‚Äúcorporation without stipulation of ownership. Therefore, basically, the opposite interpretation of paragraph 1 is true and ‚Äúno gift tax is imposed,‚Äù but paragraph 4 applies mutatis mutandis with an additional condition, so gift tax is imposed only in that case. The additional condition is ‚Äúwhen it is recognized that the burden of inheritance tax or gift tax is unreasonably reduced.</p>
<p>Article 33, Paragraph 3 of the Inheritance Tax Law Enforcement Order</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Inheritance Tax Law Enforcement Order
Article 33
3 When a juridical person without stipulated equity interest prescribed in Article 65(1) of the Act that has acquired property by gift or bequest satisfies the following requirements, it shall not be deemed to result in an undue decrease in the burden of inheritance tax or gift tax under Article 66(4) of the Act.

(iv) That there is no fact of violation of laws and regulations, no fact of concealment or disguised recording or entry of all or part of transactions in its books and documents, or any other fact contrary to public interest with respect to the said juridical person.</p>
