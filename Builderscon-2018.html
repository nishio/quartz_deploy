<li>
<p>Interesting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s been a while since I attended an engineering festival of sorts, and it was great. I used to attend, but not for a while recently, and I think I need to be proactive about it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If we don’t regularly bathe in the energy of pure creation, which we create just because we want to create it, without thinking about its usefulness or anything else, we will run out of vitamins for our minds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What’s good about it.</p>
<ul>
<li>“I made it shine just for the heck of it,” “I wanted to make it, so I made it.”</li>
<li>Filled with pure “engineering principles”.</li>
<li>I’m dazzled that I used to be like that (more than 10 years ago).
<ul>
<li>I’ll write the details on another page when I feel like it <a href="./negative-personal-history" class="internal alias" data-slug="negative-personal-history">negative personal history</a>, since it would be “abrupt self-talk” if I write it here.</li>

</li>
<li>I bought it right away because it said, “You can get it if you buy a sponsor ticket.”</li>
<li>Because the cost of the parts alone is likely to be around 10,000 yen, and if you add the labor cost of the trial and error to make it work, it’s clearly a bargain.</li>

<li>「Algorithms in React」
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a very helpful story as I recently started using React: the traverse that used to be implemented with recursive calls in React blocks the UI when it grows too large because it can’t be interrupted, so the recent React has made it possible to interrupt it using fiber.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s very good to explain what problems existed in the old implementation, how they changed it, and how it forced library users to change the way they wrote it (e.g., asynchronous state updates).</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>The priority of side-effects. User input events are high priority, so if you do heavy processing there, the input is blocked and the user is uncomfortable.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Suspense, a mechanism similar to error boundaries, which throws promises instead of errors. It is caught immediately inside the library, and the parent link is traversed asynchronously. You can only issue a loading if it takes a long time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was a good explanation of what a person with no prerequisite knowledge needs to know when they decide to do a static inspection, but it was hard to see the slides when looking forward, and the annoyance of falling asleep when your gaze goes down to the slide at hand…</p>
