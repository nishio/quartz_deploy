<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/gpt/icon" alt="gpt.icon" height="19.5"/>Apple’s new iPad Pro ad, “Crush,” depicts the destruction of creative tools such as music instruments and art supplies and their transformation into the new iPad Pro. The image was intended to symbolize the iPad Pro’s inclusiveness of all forms of creative expression, but it was perceived as a disregard for traditional creative tools and sparked significant backlash on social media and among the creative community.</p>
<p>Critics felt the ads were inappropriate and contrary to the values of sustainability that Apple often promotes. In particular, the destruction of an iconic creative tool was seen as wasteful as it lacked respect for the art community. In response to the backlash, Apple acknowledged that the ad “missed the mark” and issued an apology, canceling plans to air it on television and expressing its commitment to supporting creativity worldwide.</p>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Elaborate on the critics’ reasons for their criticism.</p>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/gpt/icon" alt="gpt.icon" height="19.5"/>There are several reasons for the criticisms critics have had of Apple’s “Crush” ads. The main points of criticism are summarized below:</p>
<ul>
<li>DESTRUCTION OF CREATIVE TOOLS: The ads depicted the physical destruction of musical instruments and art supplies. Critics felt that the destruction was wasteful and disrespectful, as these tools have been loved and respected by artists for many years. In particular, it was emphasized that these tools are symbols of individual art forms and are essential to many creative tasks, so the iPad Pro cannot completely replace them (9to5Mac).</li>
<li>Contradictory to sustainability: Apple has long emphasized its environmentally friendly image, promoting, for example, the use of recycled materials in its products. However, the destruction of creative tools shown in the ads was criticized as being inconsistent with such sustainable values. It was felt that for an environmental company to promote an image of deliberately destroying things was at odds with the brand’s beliefs (MacRumors Forums).</li>
<li>IMPACT ON CREATIVE: The visual representation of the ad’s message to those in the creative industries, that traditional tools would be destroyed and replaced by digital devices, was seen as a symbol of technology overwhelming creativity. Many creatives reacted against the ad’s message because they value the inspiration and feel that physical tools bring and do not see these as objects that should simply be digitized (AppleInsider ) (Gadgets 360).</li>
</ul>
<p>These criticisms prompted Apple to strongly reconsider its advertising strategy, resulting in Apple’s public apology and the cancellation of the broadcast of its ads on television.</p>

<p>Although the above arrangement by GPT4 as of 2024-05-13 did not tie to a specific culture or region, there were some statements in online discussions, especially early on, that tied to a specific <a href="./culture" class="internal" data-slug="culture">culture</a>, “<a href="./Japan" class="internal" data-slug="Japan">Japan</a>,” as seen in the MacRumors title.
As one of the Japanese who actually criticized it, I have mixed feelings about this reaction.</p>

<p>In the Japanese-speaking world, there were not a few claims to the effect that “only Japanese people are criticizing.
