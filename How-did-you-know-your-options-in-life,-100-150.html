I saw a DM (paper at the time) that arrived in the winter of my third year of university and applied for the job out of curiosity, thinking, ‚ÄúThis company is a joke in a good way‚Ä¶‚Äú. The written test was only logical thinking and an essay, and did not ask for any programming experience. The interview was casual and the atmosphere seemed to suit me, so I turned down all the other companies and decided to apply there.</p>
