<p>Tiamat, the primordial sea goddess in Mesopotamian mythology. She intermarried with the freshwater god Apsuu and gave birth to younger gods. For example, Tiamat produced the goddess Raham, who was paired with the curly-haired male goddess Rahum, who brought forth blessings, and the siblings Anshal and Kishal, called the progenitors of the next generation of gods, who in turn produced new gods, the next generation of gods, including Anu, who later became the sky god. She is the symbol of chaos in the primordial creation…</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>After defeating Tiamat, Marduk took the “Book of Heaven’s Life Version” from Kingu and applied Kingu’s blood to the “creation of man” to shoulder the labor of the gods, while Tiamat’s corpse was dismembered from its remains to be used as material for the “creation of heaven and earth”. It is said that they were torn in two, each becoming the heavens and the earth, and that the breast became a mountain (and a spring was created near it), and from its eye arose the two great rivers, the Tigris and the Euphrates. Thus the mother god Tiamat became the basis of the world. <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%86%E3%82%A3%E3%82%A2%E3%83%9E%E3%83%88" class="external">Tiamat - Wikipedia<svg aria-hidden="true" class="external-icon" style="max-width:0.8em;max-height:0.8em;" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><path d="M320 0H288V64h32 82.7L201.4 265.4 178.7 288 224 333.3l22.6-22.6L448 109.3V192v32h64V192 32 0H480 320zM32 32H0V64 480v32H32 456h32V480 352 320H424v32 96H64V96h96 32V32H160 32z"></path></svg></a></p>

<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>Where do these “words” come from?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Words are acquired through learning with “institutionalized” meanings. However, when we are faced with a “blur” that cannot be explained in words, there are no appropriate institutionalized words to express the blur. Therefore, existing words are used to express the new experience, and this is Eugene Gendlin’s metaphorical creation of meaning.</li>

When a question is answered quickly, it’s not so much the answer that matters, but the good stutter, the words spun after thinking for a while, that have value.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>What happens to the “blur” when that “word” is used?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>If the words and the moyamoya are “compared” and they feel right, the moyamoya is expressed in words and disappears. On the other hand, if you still feel a sense of discomfort, compare the words with the fuzziness and dig deeper to find out what is the same and what is different, and the fuzziness will be broken down into smaller pieces.</li>

<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Sometimes a probabilistic spontaneous occurrence can occur from a state of moyamoya, but it is inefficient to leave it to luck and wait for it to happen. In Mesopotamian mythology, fresh water flows in, and in the case of my sea and fish metaphor, casting a net, or in the current implementation of Keichobot, the software is trying to increase the probability of words being produced from the miasma by asking clean questions</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>The sea and fish metaphor compares verbalization to “catching a fish in the sea.

<ul>
<li>Here, the fish is hooked (the image of a harpoon with a string attached), but in the initial stage, the fish is not visible, so it is impossible to throw a harpoon at the fish. It is more appropriate to think of it as throwing a net in a fluffy manner. Throwing a harpoon has the nuance of “if it doesn’t sting, it’s an NG” and causes the false perception that the question must be answered. Test metaphor. Rather, there is a question, and even if you can’t answer it, you get a hint that “there are no fish in this area right now.

<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>In the case of a word that is understood only by an individual, the use of the word as a tool for thinking needs to cause an increase in the efficiency of thinking. In the case of words that are used by multiple people, the words need to cause a reduction in communication costs. (Of course, it is preferable if this indirectly improves the efficiency of the organization’s thinking and the thinking of individual members of the organization.</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>This can be paraphrased as the economic benefits of thought
