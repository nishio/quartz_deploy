[[Monarchy]]:.
- Typically, monarchies were often adopted when powerful leaders or military leaders conquered a region and seized power as a result.
- Others were led by those with royal bloodlines that were considered sacred.
[[Oligarchy]]:.
- The oligarchy was established when aristocrats and influential people became economically and militarily powerful, and they held political power on the back of this power.
- [[democratic system]] :
- The idea of equality among citizens and the growing need for the voice of ordinary citizens to be reflected in policy led to the idea of democracy. In Athens, in particular, citizen assemblies served as a forum for policy making.
[[council]]:.
- The need to incorporate diverse opinions and perspectives, or a cultural background that values equality, sometimes led to the adoption of multi-member decision-making.
        - [[Diverse perspectives]] <img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>
[[religious instruction]]:.
- When faith is central to society or when religious leaders have high moral authority, religious leadership has become involved in policy decisions.
[[customary law]]:.
- Societies with long traditions and histories adopted customs based on their history and culture as the basis for their laws and decisions.
<p>Like military power, economic power, faith (royal lineage considered sacred, moral authority of religious leaders), and tradition (history, culture, customs, royal lineage considered sacred)?<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/></p>

</ul>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>How did democracy and collegiality begin?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/gpt/icon" alt="gpt.icon" height="19.5"/>
The origins of democracy date back to ancient Greece, especially Athens.</p>
<ul>
<li>Athenian Democracy: In Athens in the 5th century B.C., citizens held assemblies to directly determine policies and laws. This was called “direct democracy,” a form of direct participation by citizens in policy making.</li>
<li>BACKGROUND OF DEVELOPMENT: The system developed within the specific historical and social context of Athens. The idea of equality among citizens of the city-state of Athens, the need to increase opportunities for citizens to participate in politics, and the influence of progressive thinkers combined to form the democratic system.</li>
<li>Modern Democracy: Unlike the direct democracy of ancient Greece, modern democracy developed as a “representative” system. Elected representatives generally make policy decisions that reflect the will of the citizens.</li>
</ul>
<p>The council system is a method in which several members come together to make decisions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tribal Society: In some ancient tribal societies, tribal elders and influential people would meet <a href="./in-council" class="internal alias" data-slug="in-council">in council</a> to make decisions. This was based on tribal traditions and customs and was used as a way <a href="./to-reflect-the-will-of-the-community" class="internal alias" data-slug="to-reflect-the-will-of-the-community">to reflect the will of the community</a>.</li>
<li>Medieval Europe: Cities and fiefdoms in medieval Europe had councils, where the merchants of the city and the powerful men of the fiefdoms met for collegial decision-making.</li>
<li>Modern: As the parliamentary system developed in the modern era, collegial decision-making took place as a large number of members debated within the assembly.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Why did direct democracy begin in Athens?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/gpt/icon" alt="gpt.icon" height="19.5"/>
Political Background: Athenian politics began as a monarchy and later transitioned to an aristocracy.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, amidst competition among the nobility and growing discontent among the general public, a number of reformers emerged and gradually reformed the political system.</li>
<li>In particular, the reforms of Solon and Cleisthenes were directed toward increasing the political participation of citizens.</li>
</ul>
<p>Economic Background:.</p>
<ul>
<li>As Athens’ economy grew and commercial activities developed, the emerging wealthy and merchant class grew in power.</li>
<li>This has led more citizens, not just the traditional aristocracy, to seek opportunities to become involved in politics.
<ul>
<li>This is “economic power.”<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Military Background:.</p>
<ul>
<li>As the role of Athens’ citizen army, the “<a href="./hoplitai" class="internal" data-slug="hoplitai">hoplitai</a>,” increased, ordinary citizens also began to participate in the defense of the country.</li>
<li>This resulted in a growing demand for political rights by citizens who had made military contributions.
<ul>
<li>This is “military power.”<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Cultural and philosophical background:.</p>
<ul>
<li>Philosophy and rhetoric flourished in Athens, where free debate and critical thinking were encouraged.</li>
<li>This cultural background provided the soil for citizens’ political participation and the idea of direct democracy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Social context:.</p>
<ul>
<li>Athenian society became increasingly critical of the idea of equality among citizens and of the privileges held only by certain classes and families.</li>
<li>It is against this backdrop that the idea of direct democracy, in which all citizens participate in politics, has gained acceptance.</li>
</ul>
<p>These factors, intricately intertwined, laid the groundwork for the formation of Athens’ direct democracy. And through the work of certain reformers, this system came to be realized in a tangible way.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Solon, an Athenian politician, was supported by both the nobility and the commoners, with whom he had been at odds, and when he became archon and was entrusted with full authority, he instituted reforms. The aim of his reforms was to mediate the conflict between the nobility and the commoners. Although he is sometimes called a “mediator” because of his stance, his reforms were actually aimed at protecting the lives of citizens by being harsh on the nobility and the wealthy.
In Athens, despite Solon’s fierce resistance, a dictatorship known as Peisistratos’ usurper government appeared thereafter, and democracy was finally realized with the reforms of Cleisthenes at the end of the 6th century BCE. Solon’s reforms can be regarded as the first step toward democratic government.</p>

<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Why Solon was supported by both nobles and commoners, who were at odds with each other, and why he became an alcon</p>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/gpt/icon" alt="gpt.icon" height="19.5"/>The following factors contributed to Solon’s becoming an alcon with the support of both the nobility and the commoners with whom he was at odds:</p>
<ul>
<li>SOCIAL SITUATION: At the time of Solon’s activities, Athenian society was facing a major economic and social crisis. Many commoners faced economic difficulties, including enslavement due to debt. In contrast, the nobility and the wealthy monopolized land and power and retained their economic and political advantages.</li>
<li>Solon’s Background: Although Solon himself came from an aristocratic background, through his work as a poet he had a deep understanding of the suffering and discontent of the common people. For this reason, he was positioned as someone who was understood by both the nobility and the common people.</li>
<li>Mediatorial stance: Solon won the trust of both sides by taking a fair and neutral position, without extremes. He proposed reforms that expanded the rights of the commoners while protecting the interests of the nobility within certain limits, a balance that won the support of both sides.</li>
<li>Reforms: Solon’s reforms took into account the interests of the commoners by canceling debts, prohibiting enslavement, and clarifying laws. Through these reforms, he aimed to alleviate social inequalities and contradictions and build a stable society.</li>
</ul>
<p>Solon’s stance as a mediator, his background, and the reforms he proposed were the factors that earned him support from both nobles and commoners alike, and led to his appointment to the position of alcon.</p>
