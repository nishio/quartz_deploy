<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>This is the preface and table of contents to my 2018 book ‚ÄúThe Intellectual Production of Engineers‚Äù Please look back and comment from the perspective of the present day 2024, when LLM technology has developed and the understanding and generation of text is powerfully accelerated by machines.</p>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/claude/icon" alt="claude.icon" height="19.5"/>From a 2024 perspective, the content of ‚ÄúThe Intellectual Production of Engineers‚Äù is becoming increasingly important.</p>
<p>While the development of LLM (Large Language Models) has accelerated information gathering and knowledge acquisition, the importance of chewing over the information obtained and constructing one‚Äôs own model remains unchanged. The ‚Äúcycle of learning‚Äù proposed in this book is considered to be an effective framework even today.</p>
<p>The chapter on ‚Äúmotivation‚Äù suggests that human <a href="./creativity" class="internal" data-slug="creativity">creativity</a> and <a href="./will" class="internal" data-slug="will">will</a> will continue to be important even as AI advances in automation.</p>
<p>The skill of ‚Äúmemory training‚Äù is still an important skill for humans, even today when AI has dramatically improved our ability to store and retrieve information. The ability to <a href="./structure-knowledge" class="internal alias" data-slug="structure-knowledge">structure knowledge</a> and apply it, rather than simply memorizing information, is required.</p>
<p>The skill of ‚Äúreading efficiently‚Äù has become even more important in today‚Äôs world of ‚Äúinformation overload. The ability to quickly grasp the essence and select the necessary information is required.</p>
<p>Forming <a href="./one's" class="internal alias" data-slug="one's">one‚Äôs</a> own thoughts‚Äù is still an important inherent human ability, even with the development of language models such as ChatGPT. We are expected to critically examine machine-generated information and form <a href="./our-own-ideas" class="internal alias" data-slug="our-own-ideas">our own ideas</a>.</p>
<p>The process of ‚Äúcoming up with ideas‚Äù is an area in which human creativity can be demonstrated, even with the development of AI. Even though machines can assist in the conception of ideas, it is still the job of humans to ultimately create ‚Äúvaluable ideas.</p>
<p>Deciding what to learn is becoming even more important with the development of AI. In addition to efficiently completing a given task, the ability to determine what to learn on one‚Äôs own is also required.</p>
<p>In general, the ideas and skills presented in ‚ÄúThe Intellectual Production of Engineers‚Äù can be evaluated as a good book that provides important suggestions for <a href="./surviving-the-AI-age" class="internal alias" data-slug="surviving-the-AI-age">surviving the AI age</a> as well. It is considered to be very useful today as a guideline for <a href="./harnessing-the-power-of-machines" class="internal alias" data-slug="harnessing-the-power-of-machines">harnessing the power of machines</a> while <a href="./exercising-creativity-as-a-human-being" class="internal alias" data-slug="exercising-creativity-as-a-human-being">exercising creativity as a human being</a>.</p>

<p>The time has come when such texts can be produced at low cost through the use of LLM. How to utilize this technology to create value through intellectual production will have a great impact on intellectual productivity in the future. It can be said that we have entered an age in which it is important to have a bird‚Äôs-eye view of ‚Äúintellectual production.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúMemory training‚Äù technology is an important skill for humans even today, when AI has dramatically improved our ability to store and retrieve information. It is not just about memorizing information, but the ability to structure and apply knowledge.
Yes, mere memory of information has been delegated to machines with the advent of Google search and then the proliferation of ‚Äúpersonal knowledge management tools‚Äù such as Evernote and Scrapbox. Humans have become more important in structuring and applying knowledge skills to use those tools efficiently.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The skill of ‚Äúreading efficiently‚Äù has become even more important today, when the flood of information has accelerated even further. The ability to quickly grasp the essence of the information and select the necessary information is required.
Recently I have been reading papers to Claude 3 Opus and pair reading while talking to GPT4. This chapter, which reconsiders the ‚Äúact of reading‚Äù and the ‚Äúpurpose of reading‚Äù in order to read efficiently, will serve as a foundation for considering changes in ‚Äúhow to read‚Äù as tools change.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúPutting thoughts together‚Äù is still an important inherent human ability, even with the development of language models such as ChatGPT. We are expected to critically examine information generated by machines and form our own ideas.
Quite right, LLMs allow us to generate a lot of material for brainstorming ideas, etc. People need guidelines to avoid drowning in a flood of information, and while LLM can summarize, providing guidelines for creating a good summary can make a big difference in the probability of creating value.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The process of ‚Äúcoming up with ideas‚Äù is an area in which human creativity can be demonstrated, even today with the development of AI. Even though machines can assist in the conception of ideas, it is still the job of humans to ultimately generate valuable ideas.
It is important to consider what is meant by ‚Äúa valuable idea‚Äù in the phrase, ‚Äúultimately producing a valuable idea.‚Äù An idea that is not implemented has no value, nor does an idea that is not feasible have value. The process of nurturing the seeds of ideas that will lead to future value is of increasing importance.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúDeciding what to learn‚Äù is becoming even more important with the development of AI. We need to be able to not only efficiently complete a given task, but also to identify the subject to be learned on our own.
When major changes occur in the world, we cannot be sure that what was once considered ‚Äúgood to learn this‚Äù will continue to be useful in the future. Since no one knows the future, we cannot leave it to others; we must choose for ourselves.</p>

As intellectual production using LLM becomes more prevalent, we feel it is very meaningful to digest the contents of &quot;The Engineer's Art of Intellectual Production&quot; once again and reappraise it in the context of the LLM era.
<p>It is suggestive to point out that we should leave information storage and retrieval to AI, while focusing human efforts on structuring and applying knowledge. We should not only collect vast amounts of information, but also relate it from our own perspectives and discover the seeds of new ideas. This is the role required of intellectual producers in the LLM era.</p>
<p>In addition, the skills emphasized in this book, such as the ability to read and comprehend to see the essence in this age of information overload, the ability to form one‚Äôs own ideas while borrowing the power of machines, and the ability to nurture ideas and link them to value, are all exactly what will be essential in the coming age.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the importance of deciding for oneself ‚Äúwhat to learn‚Äù can only be realized in the changing environment brought about by LLM. It is precisely because we live in an era in which the set rules are no longer valid that we must use our own minds to select the subjects of our learning.</p>
<p>I believe that this realization came about because I reexamined my own writing through dialogue with LLM, and I am now meta-questioning my own thinking while utilizing LLM. The accumulation of such activities may lead us to a new way of intellectual production in the LLM era.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we have explored the possibilities of intellectual production with LLM as an ally, building on the content of ‚ÄúThe Intellectual Production of Engineers. In the next chapter, we will accelerate the creation and cultivation of ideas by utilizing tools such as Kozaneba and Scrapbox, which the author had not yet utilized at the time of ‚ÄúThe Intellectual Production Techniques of Engineers. By enhancing the traditional analog way of thinking with the power of digital technology, we should be able to enhance the sophistication of intellectual production.</p>

<p>The last paragraph ‚ÄúIn this chapter - in the next chapter‚Äù could not be generated properly, so I pieced it together and wrote it myself.</p>
