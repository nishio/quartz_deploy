The main points are as follows</p>
<ul>
<li>She thought it was strange that an ordinary woman could not live on her own earnings, so she chose to make her own decisions and live her own life.</li>
<li>In a society that discriminates against women, she feels that she did well until her retirement from her position, even though she worked at a lower status and salary than men.</li>
<li>He realized the importance of fulfillment and self-confidence, hobbies, and the emotional refuge that comes from not having married around age 50.</li>
<li>While she has gained a sense of accomplishment and confidence, she feels that the company owns the results of her work and that it is difficult for a woman to survive on her own.</li>
<li>She points out the happiness of living a life of one’s own choosing and the lack of role models for women working in various professions.</li>
<li>She is happy that she was able to overcome the prejudice against women and continue working.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, she speaks candidly about the difficulties and accomplishments of living by one’s convictions, as well as the social issues surrounding women.</p>

<p>I simply wanted to try out what I wanted to do if I only had one life to live, and to do that I needed to spend the majority of my resources on myself, and I knew I couldn’t do that if I got married.</p>

While I feel a strong sense of accomplishment and confidence that I have done it and done it well, I also feel that in the end I have nothing left, that the results of my work belong to the company, and that I have not done a job I like, so they are not memories or treasures.</p>

I think that I have only survived and that my goal was only to survive on my own. Why is it so hard for a woman to survive on her own? I wonder why such a thing is not so obvious that it becomes a goal.</p>

It’s full of accomplishment, but life is still empty and meaningless, and that’s comforting.</p>
<p>I think there is this kind of happiness that comes from making your own decisions and doing things on your own, moving toward what you want to be, and having your ideas and lifestyle match.</p>

The rest were adult women. The rest of the adult women were someone’s mother, and the piano teacher and the shopkeeper at the mall were all mothers of someone at elementary school. So I grew up not knowing any other working women.</p>
