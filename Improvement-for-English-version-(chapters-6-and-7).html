<li>When we reduce an abstract concept that has no physical form to a physical sense, we often create a metaphor. Since the abstract concept has no form in reality, we compare it to something else that exists in reality. A parable can be taken as a physical sensation or experience that has not yet been verbalized beneath the surface, but is barely verbalized through the uncommon use of words.

<li>Abstract concepts have no physical form. When we bring them closer to concrete physical sensations, they often give rise to parables.</li>
<li>Why. Abstract concepts cannot be captured by the physical senses because they have no physical form. By trying to capture it with the physical senses, we begin to use objects that have physical form in place of the concept.</li>
<li>In a parable, words are used to mean something different from their common meaning. Through this uncommon use, your experience, which is not yet in the form of words, barely partially becomes a form of words.</li>

<li>This question has the effect of making us think that X is not an abstract entity, but a physical entity that occupies a place. This question encourages abstract concepts to become physical metaphors.</li>
<li>For example, ‚Äúcreativity‚Äù is an abstract concept. Let us ask the question. Where is creativity? Think about it for a moment.</li>

<li>After explaining all this, I realized that there is a second kind of creativity, namely, creativity in the belly.

<li>The ‚ù∫ is a direct metaphor elicitation question. Metaphors are generated and clarified by these five basic questions. These clarified metaphors are called ‚Äúsymbols‚Äù in Symbolic Modelling.

<li>In 1644, Ren√© Descartes (Descartes) proposed the methodical skepticism of ‚Äúdoubting everything but what is certain‚Äù in his book ‚ÄúThe Principles of Philosophy‚Äù>+ Note 2.
From 1781 to 1790, Immanuel Kant (1781-1790), who considered doubt (criticism) to be the most important task of philosophy, published books entitled ‚ÄúCritique of Pure Reason,‚Äù ‚ÄúCritique of Practical Reason,‚Äù and ‚ÄúCritique of Judgment‚Äù in which he used the term ‚Äúcriticism‚Äù to describe the process of linguistic thinking. The term ‚Äúcritical philosophy‚Äù in the title of Polanyi‚Äôs book refers to this.</li>

<p>-Ikujiro Nonaka, a management scientist, discussed knowledge creation within organizations in his 1996 book ‚ÄúThe Knowledge Creating Company‚Äù Note 4. focused on knowledge creation by individuals, but Ikujiro Nonaka‚Äôs interest is in knowledge creation within organizations.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>+In 1996, management scholar Ikujiro Nonaka developed Polanyi‚Äôs ideas in his book ‚ÄúThe Knowledge Creating Company.
We divided knowledge into formal knowledge, which is verbalized, and tacit knowledge, which is empirical knowledge that has not yet been verbalized. We then added the dimension of whether knowledge resides in individuals or in organizations. This is to discuss knowledge creation within organizations; Polanyi‚Äôs interest was in the knowledge creation of individual scientists, whereas Nonaka‚Äôs interest was in knowledge creation within organizations.</p>

<li>I am sure you have all experienced this kind of ‚Äúuncomfortable‚Äù feeling. However, since the reason is not verbalized, many people may take it as something inferior and disregard it. However, it is rather the opposite, and it is better to see discomfort as an important sign that the reason has not yet been verbalized, and that there is something there that needs to be verbalized.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>+I am sure you have all experienced this kind of ‚Äúdiscomfort‚Äù. Since the reason for the discomfort is not yet put into words, we tend to feel that it is inferior to what has been put into words. Therefore, discomfort is easily disregarded.
But it is the opposite. Discomfort is a sign that ‚Äúwhat is not yet verbalized‚Äù is there. It is like the shadow of a fish swimming on the surface of the water. Linguization is to catch it.</p>

<p>What I found particularly interesting was the step of using a dictionary. You look up key words in the dictionary that seem important in the short sentence and compare the dictionary description with what you meant to say. Since the words in the short sentences are words that I have tentatively applied to a felt sense that I cannot express well, there is often some discrepancy when I compare them with the dictionary explanation. I pay attention to that discrepancy, or discomfort.</p>

<p>For example, I have a metaphor that says, ‚ÄúI have a gear in my head that sometimes spins around at high speed.

<li>In that case, the gears in my head are turning at high speed.</li>

<p>I was strongly disconcerted when I looked up meditation in the dictionary and found that it means ‚Äúto meditate deeply and quietly with one‚Äôs eyes closed. The felt sense I was trying to describe with the word ‚Äúmeditation‚Äù does not require closing one‚Äôs eyes. Also, the expression ‚Äúmeditate on a thought‚Äù does not fit the image of trying to turn something and slowing down its rotation.

<li>However, when I looked up meditation in the dictionary, I found that it is ‚Äúto close one‚Äôs eyes and meditate deeply and quietly.</li>
<li>The dictionary definition of the word ‚Äúmeditation‚Äù does not match the felt sense I have tried to express with the word ‚Äúmeditation‚Äù. There is a discrepancy.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>I think ‚Äúdeep‚Äù and ‚Äúquiet‚Äù are words that fit well in describing my felt sense. This would correspond to ‚Äúslow down‚Äù. So, the opposite of ‚Äúdeep‚Äù and ‚Äúquiet‚Äù should correspond to ‚Äúspinning at high speed‚Äù. Will it spin noisily? The opposite of deep, shallow or high would be incongruous.

<p>Public and private language</p>
<ul>
<li>There are two types of language: public language and private language.</li>
<li>Consider two people, Mr. A and Mr. B.</li>
<li>The definition of the meaning of a word by a dictionary is shared between Mr. A and Mr. B. This ‚Äúmeaning‚Äù is in the common domain of Mr. A‚Äôs and Mr. B‚Äôs icebergs.</li>
<li>On the other hand, the ‚Äúnewborn words‚Äù spoken by Mr. A in his attempt to verbalize something that has not been verbalized are near the surface of Mr. A‚Äôs iceberg. Therefore, we do not know if Mr. B, who sees the words, will feel that they ‚Äúmean what Mr. A intended them to mean.</li>
<li>Since the ‚Äúnewborn language‚Äù is private, one need not worry about whether or not others will understand it. On the other hand, to communicate it to others, we need to refine it into a better expression.
<ul>
<li>This is similar to what <a href="./(6.1.2.1)-Young's-Idea-Method" class="internal alias" data-slug="(6.1.2.1)-Young's-Idea-Method">(6.1.2.1) Young‚Äôs Idea Method</a> says, ‚Äú[Ideas don‚Äôt work very effectively as they are born.</li>
<li>Whether it is a word or an idea, it has to be nurtured after its budding.</li>
