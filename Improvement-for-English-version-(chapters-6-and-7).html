<li>This question has the effect of making us think that X is not an abstract entity, but a physical entity that occupies a place. This question encourages abstract concepts to become physical metaphors.</li>
<li>For example, “creativity” is an abstract concept. Let us ask the question. Where is creativity? Think about it for a moment.</li>

<li>Where does creativity reside?” If you answered, “It’s in my head,” that would imply that “other team members can’t see your creativity directly.

<li>The ❺ is a direct metaphor elicitation question. Metaphors are generated and clarified by these five basic questions. These clarified metaphors are called “symbols” in Symbolic Modelling.

We divided knowledge into formal knowledge, which is verbalized, and tacit knowledge, which is empirical knowledge that has not yet been verbalized. We then added the dimension of whether knowledge resides in individuals or in organizations. This is to discuss knowledge creation within organizations; Polanyi’s interest was in the knowledge creation of individual scientists, whereas Nonaka’s interest was in knowledge creation within organizations.</p>

<li>I am sure you have all experienced this kind of “uncomfortable” feeling. However, since the reason is not verbalized, many people may take it as something inferior and disregard it. However, it is rather the opposite, and it is better to see discomfort as an important sign that the reason has not yet been verbalized, and that there is something there that needs to be verbalized.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>+I am sure you have all experienced this kind of “discomfort”. Since the reason for the discomfort is not yet put into words, we tend to feel that it is inferior to what has been put into words. Therefore, discomfort is easily disregarded.
But it is the opposite. Discomfort is a sign that “what is not yet verbalized” is there. It is like the shadow of a fish swimming on the surface of the water. Linguization is to catch it.</p>

<p>-TAE is a complex methodology consisting of 14 steps, so we will not describe it in detail here. The philosopher Eugene T.

<li>TAE is a complex methodology consisting of 14 steps and will not be described in detail here. The philosopher Eugene T. Gendlin, who developed the method, calls “what has not yet been put into words well” by the name “felt sense. Giving a name to a concept is useful because it can be used as a handle to point to the concept. Therefore, we will adopt the term “felt sense” in this document as well.</li>

<p>What I found particularly interesting was the step of using a dictionary. You look up key words in the dictionary that seem important in the short sentence and compare the dictionary description with what you meant to say. Since the words in the short sentences are words that I have tentatively applied to a felt sense that I cannot express well, there is often some discrepancy when I compare them with the dictionary explanation. I pay attention to that discrepancy, or discomfort.</p>

<li>Then, compare the dictionary description with what you want to say.</li>

<p>For example, I have a metaphor that says, “I have a gear in my head that sometimes spins around at high speed. I have a metaphor that if I let other gears work in this state, the teeth will be chipped, so I need to slow down. One day it occurred to me that this “slowing down” might be what the world calls “meditation.</p>

<ul>
<li>For example, I have a metaphor.
<ul>
<li>I have gears in my head.</li>
<li>Sometimes its gears do not mesh with other gears.</li>
<li>In that case, the gears in my head are turning at high speed.</li>
<li>If that gear were to mesh with another gear, the tooth would be chipped.</li>
<li>So we need to slow down the rotation of the gears.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>At one point, it occurred to me that this “slowing down the rotation” might be what the world calls “meditation.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I was strongly disconcerted when I looked up meditation in the dictionary and found that it means “to meditate deeply and quietly with one’s eyes closed. The felt sense I was trying to describe with the word “meditation” does not require closing one’s eyes. Also, the expression “meditate on a thought” does not fit the image of trying to turn something and slowing down its rotation. The only words that fit me in this description are “deeply” and “quietly”.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>However, when I looked up meditation in the dictionary, I found that it is “to close one’s eyes and meditate deeply and quietly.</li>
<li>The dictionary definition of the word “meditation” does not match the felt sense I have tried to express with the word “meditation”. There is a discrepancy.</li>
<li>We focus on this discomfort. What does not feel right?</li>
<li>The felt sense I have tried to describe by the word “meditation” does not require closing your eyes.</li>
<li>Also, the expression “thinking about” does not fit the image of trying to rotate something and slowing down the rotation.</li>
<li>The only words in this dictionary description that fit me well are “deep” and “quiet”.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I think “deep” and “quiet” are words that fit well in describing my felt sense. This would correspond to “slow down”. So, the opposite of “deep” and “quiet” should correspond to “spinning at high speed”. Will it spin noisily? The opposite of deep, shallow or high would be incongruous. If it is floating or not grounded, it would be acceptable. In this way, by looking up key words in a dictionary and focusing on the discomfort of the explanation, you are making your point clearer.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>In other words, “deep” and “quiet” are important words to describe felt sense. Let’s focus on this.
<ul>
<li>The words “deeply” and “quietly” would seem to correspond to “slowing down.” Then, conversely, the opposite of “deeply” and “quietly” should correspond to “spinning at high speed.</li>
<li>Will it spin noisily?”</li>
<li>What is the opposite of “deep? Shallow or high doesn’t feel right. If it is floating or ungrounded, is it acceptable?” the thought develops.</li>

<li>Intent: the terminology of Merleau-Ponty was used verbatim in the text, which made it difficult to understand. The terminology is not important and should be relegated to a footnote.</li>
</ul>
<p>Public and private language</p>
<ul>
<li>There are two types of language: public language and private language.</li>
<li>Consider two people, Mr. A and Mr. B.</li>
<li>The definition of the meaning of a word by a dictionary is shared between Mr. A and Mr. B. This “meaning” is in the common domain of Mr. A’s and Mr. B’s icebergs.</li>
<li>On the other hand, the “newborn words” spoken by Mr. A in his attempt to verbalize something that has not been verbalized are near the surface of Mr. A’s iceberg. Therefore, we do not know if Mr. B, who sees the words, will feel that they “mean what Mr. A intended them to mean.</li>
<li>Since the “newborn language” is private, one need not worry about whether or not others will understand it. On the other hand, to communicate it to others, we need to refine it into a better expression.
<ul>
<li>This is similar to what <a href="./(6.1.2.1)-Young's-Idea-Method" class="internal alias" data-slug="(6.1.2.1)-Young's-Idea-Method">(6.1.2.1) Young’s Idea Method</a> says, “[Ideas don’t work very effectively as they are born.</li>
<li>Whether it is a word or an idea, it has to be nurtured after its budding.</li>
<li>The method described in <a href="./(6.2.5.4)-Matching-against-dictionaries" class="internal alias" data-slug="(6.2.5.4)-Matching-against-dictionaries">(6.2.5.4) Matching against dictionaries</a> is a technique for clarifying what you want to say by comparing what you want to say in “newborn words” with the public meaning in the dictionary.</li>
<li>Promoting understanding by comparing similar things (<a href="./(1.5.1.1)-Notice-between-&quot;same&quot;-and-&quot;different&quot;." class="internal alias" data-slug="(1.5.1.1)-Notice-between-&quot;same&quot;-and-&quot;different&quot;.">(1.5.1.1) Notice between “same” and “different”.</a> ).</li>

<p>The term “institutionalization” was used by philosopher Maurice Merleau-Ponty.

<li>Philosopher Maurice Merleau-Ponty believed that personal and private “words being spoken” become public “institutionalized words” after they are born. In the process of “institutionalization,” words are created that are used to mean something common among several people. We usually communicate with others by using “institutionalized language. However, at the time a word is first produced, it is not institutionalized.
