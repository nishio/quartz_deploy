<pre><code>### Behind the Scenes of Thinking: Between Thinking and Communicating
		Thinking and communicating are two different processes. We use temporary language for concepts that have not yet been embodied and do not need to be communicated. Communicating what we think to others is value-based.

	>Figures for Communicating and Figures for Thinking:.
		There is a difference between the &quot;diagrams for communicating&quot; that we usually see and the &quot;diagrams for thinking&quot; that form original ideas. Using ceramics as an example, the process of thinking is expressed as a kind of trial and error or &quot;conversation.

	>To whom it may concern:.
		The target of communication includes not only humans but also computers. The programmer's first priority is to make the computer understand the message, and then to put it into a form that is easily understood by humans.

### Words to Think and Words to Communicate
Words to Think and Words to Communicate
Associated from [Resolution of reality].

 Words to communicate are meant to be communicated, so they must be adapted to the vocabulary of the receiver.
 Not so with words for thinking.
 　It doesn't have to be communicated.
 　　So it doesn't have to be an existing &quot;well-known term&quot;.
 　It is beneficial to increase the resolution to the object of consideration
 　　So it is more beneficial to keep creating new words!

　 [Increase the resolution of language.] 



### To express is to be aware
To express is to be aware
>&quot;For the subject who speaks, to express is to be aware. He does not express himself merely for the sake of others. He expresses in order to know for himself what he is aiming at&quot; ([Merleau-Ponty.], Takahashi (trans.), [Challenges of Phenomenology]).

I write for myself to know, not for others, but [you may read].
　That's why I write so much in this Scrapbox [Half, but not all.]
　Sometimes I write a summary article with a feeling of &quot;[Since I have received charity from the world, I should also give charity to the world]&quot;.



### Enlightenment and then preaching against the machine
Enlightenment and then preaching against the machine
 Open [enlightenment] and then [teaching Buddhism through the use of dialogue], not the other way around
　First, understand [non-verbal].
　　After that, it becomes &quot;a word that I understand but [others] don't.&quot;
　　Then you try to explain it to individual others, and it becomes &quot;[a] language they can understand.
　It will be a long time before it becomes [a language that can be communicated to an unspecified number of people].
　　It may not be expressible in the current vocabulary to begin with.
　　There are problems on the part of people to begin with, and they may not understand whatever way you tell them.

### 🤖🔁The difference between &quot;made&quot; and &quot;used&quot;.
[https://gyazo.com/d5300ee090d98d1a49fab193a4a28330]
In Mr. Tachikawa's model, there is an event in the mind of the other party, that event is verbalized and becomes an expression, and then I interpret that expression. In my &quot;[Distinction between fact and interpretation]&quot; model, on the other hand, the other party's verbalized expression is the fact, which I interpret. I ignore the other party's inner world because it is unobservable.

For example, one person may want to &quot;start some conversation&quot; and ask, &quot;Did you change your glasses?&quot; I might say, &quot;When was the last time we met? To which I reply, &quot;When was the last time we met? (true story) &quot;Did you change your glasses? (true story) I took &quot;Did you change your glasses?&quot; literally as a question, &quot;Did you change your glasses between the last time we met? I took &quot;Did you change your glasses between the time we met before and now? Did you change your glasses?&quot; I don't think there is a different intention behind the expression &quot;Did you change your glasses?

 It is necessary to clarify the purpose of writing output. For example, if the purpose is to &quot;convey your ideas to others, convince them, and have them help you with your work,&quot; you have &quot;succeeded&quot; if you have convinced them and had them help you. If, in doing so, for example, you read an explanation of &quot;how to create easy-to-understand sentences&quot; and used that knowledge, it means that you &quot;actually applied the knowledge you gained from the explanation&quot;.


### It's hard to verbalize what you don't know.
It's hard to verbalize what you don't understand.
It would be good to add this in the free text field as a comment from the instructor:.

It is difficult to verbalize what we do not know. What is not understood is not clearly seen. It is absurd to try to explain it in neat and tidy words.

It is important to write it down first, even if it is just a list of fragmentary keywords. There is no need to try to make it into a sentence, no need to use &quot;ishasu&quot; or &quot;ishimasu&quot;.

Nishio is not an esper and cannot read what is in your mind. If you want to increase the probability that your questions will be answered, you need to pull out as many words as possible from your mind and write them down here; otherwise, you will not be able to get the answers you need.




### AI Doctrine
　　　It must be undoable, since this judgment by humans may turn out to be wrong after the fact.
　　　This can be accomplished by recording the use of both words before merging
　It is good to use holy words, but humans are too stupid to endure the constant use of holy words. Therefore, it is permissible to use &quot;secular language.
　　Prefixes should be placed on the sacred words so that it is easy to discern whether they are sacred or secular words
　It is good to translate wisdom written in secular language into sacred language
　　This translation by humans can be an error, so the sacred and secular words need to be written side by side for later verification.
　　The source should be clearly stated
　Humans should strive to maintain the integrity of a system written in the sacred language, but because humans are stupid, the larger the system, the more difficult it becomes to maintain integrity with human capabilities. Therefore, it is preferable to enable integrity checks by computer
　　It is undesirable to restrict the expression of the sacred words for this consistency check (e.g., limiting them to propositional logic), as this would be an obstacle to the incorporation into the body of knowledge of wisdom that is difficult to express by the chosen model.


### Prepare a column about ChatGPT
[/nishio/human.icon]That's a little vague, I'm thinking that putting the output in a place that is not open access, or trying to express things in a one-dimensional string of sentences, both of which would be outdated.
[/nishio/kei.icon]When you said &quot;enumeration,&quot; what did you mean?
[/nishio/human.icon]The representation of information by arranging words in a sequence is not efficient for human beings because it was only popular because it was inexpensive to reproduce information in that format for a while after letterpress printing.
[/nishio/kei.icon]When you said &quot;express,&quot; what specific form of expression did you mean?
[/nishio/human.icon]In addition to being represented by a sequence of words, there are pictures, illustrations, and sticky notes arranged two-dimensionally.
[/nishio/kei.icon]Did you come up with any other ways to &quot;express&quot; yourself?
