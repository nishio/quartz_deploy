*1293776033*Continued - Value of the Yen
This is a sequel to my previous article &quot;&lt;a href='http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nishiohirokazu/20101216/1292519869'>The Value of the Yen&lt;/a>&quot;. I had heard of the Plaza Accord, but I had no idea how it affects this issue and so on. thanks id:kaorun, id:kazuho, id:atsuoishimoto

I didn't know about the new yen switch or the estate tax, that was a long time ago for me at 29, but I guess my almost 80 year old grandfather went through this when he was in his 20's.

In summary, stock prices have increased 7 times, gold has increased 5.6 times, and prices have increased 3 times, even if we remove the period around 1970 when the new yen changeover took place. Gold imports were not liberalized until 1878, and the price of gold reached an all-time high in 1980 and did not return to the same level until 2008. The U.S. price index is 5.5 times higher than that of Japan (1.83 times). 1 dollar was 360 yen, so it is 4 times lower than Japan.

1897: Japan goes on the gold standard.
1917:The gold standard stops functioning as countries follow Britain's suspension of gold exports following WW1. Gold exports are banned in Japan as well.
1925: Retail gold price in Japan: 1.73 yen/g
:1944:&lt;a href='http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%96%E3%83%AC%E3%83%88%E3%83%B3 %E3%83%BB%E3%82%A6%E3%83%83%E3%82%BA%E5%8D%94%E5%AE %9A'>Bretton Woods Agreement&lt;/a> &quot;One ounce of gold was set at US$35 and the exchange ratio of each country's currency to that dollar was set (gold standard). The Japanese yen was set at US$1 = ¥360.&quot; An ounce of gold is 31.1035g ref.&lt;a href='http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%88%E3%83%AD%E3%82%A4%E3%82%AA%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B9'>troy ounce. &lt;/a> Calculation shows that 1g of gold is 405.1 yen
1945: IMF established; retail gold price in Japan ¥4.80/g, 80 times different from the price in USD because import/export of gold was banned.
1946: In order to control inflation, &lt;a href='http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%96%B0%E5%86%86%E5%88%87%E6%9B%BF'>new yen switchover&lt;/a> was announced on the evening of February 16, 1946. The old yen was forced to be deposited in banks from the following day, February 17, and as of March 3, circulation of the old yen in the market was suspended, and the amount of new yen withdrawal was limited to 500 yen per household per month. The Property Tax Law imposes a tax of up to 90% on property, and the retail price of gold in Japan goes from 4.8 yen/g to 150 yen/g between 1945 and 1972. &lt;a href='http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%B6%88%E8%B2%BB%E8%80%85%E7%89%A9 %E4%BE%A1%E6%8C%87%E6%95%B0'>Consumer Price Index&lt;/a> survey begins, with 2005 as 100. 16.6 for food, 29.0 for utilities, 32.1 for health care (no overall index because items are different from today)
1950: Retail gold price in Japan: 401 yen/g
1958:First 10,000 yen bill issued
1968: Start of the Tokyo Stock Exchange Stock Price Index, with the stock price as of 1968-01-04 as the index value of 100.
1970:Consumer Price Index (CPI), 32.5 for total. 690 yen/g gold retail price in Japan. 38.8 for U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI), All item.
1971-08: The U.S. economy, exhausted from the Vietnam War and other factors, suffers the &lt;a href='http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%8B%E3%82%AF%E3%82%BD%E3%83%B3 %E3%83%BB%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A7%. E3%83%83%E3%82%AF'>Nixon Shock&lt;/a>. Suspension of exchange of dollars for gold
1971-12: A multilateral adjustment of currencies ($35 to $38 per ounce of gold, revaluation from ¥360 to ¥308 per dollar) and the maintenance of a fixed exchange rate system took place, but this Smithsonian system did not last long.
1973: Transition to floating exchange rate system (Kingston System). Gold exports are liberalized in Japan. Gold is at 73.3 (March) 775 yen, high 1160 yen. The following year, 1974: low 1145 yen, average 1598 yen.
1974, 1980: Oil crisis. The official exchange rate reached its highest level of 9% around 1974 and 1980 to control inflation.
1975: Gold retail price in Japan: 1616 yen/g
1978:Gold imports also liberalized in Japan
1980:Gold hits all-time high (not rewritten until 2008) $850/oz. The dollar averaged 226.75 yen that year, so 14822 yen per gram. Retail price in Japan is 6495 yen.
:1985:&lt;a href='http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%97%E3%83%A9%E3%82%B6%E5%90%88%E6%84%8F'>The Plaza Accord&lt;/a> &quot;In the day (24 hours) following the announcement, the dollar-yen rate dropped about ¥20 from ¥235 per dollar. A year later, the dollar's value had almost halved and was trading in the 150-yen range.&quot; In the years since 1985, the value of the dollar, with gold as the denominator, has fallen while the yen has risen in the opposite direction. If we take a larger period, 1980-1990, the dollar has risen 1.6 times while the yen has risen 2.5 times.
1989-12-28:TOPIX highest price 2884.80
2000:Retail gold price in Japan 1014 yen/g. Compounded since 1975 -4.5%.
2009:US CPI, 214.537 in All item. 5.5x since 1970.
2010:The annual average yen-dollar rate hit the ¥80 level for the first time; TOPIX closed at 898.80, about 9 times since 1968. Retail gold price in Japan at 3889 yen/g as of 12-27, 14% compounded since 2000.

@atsuoishimoto:
@nishio There was tremendous inflation in Japan right after the war, and prices were about 7-8 times higher from 45 to the 50s when they joined the IMF. http://goo.gl/7uBnL

*1293787457*Nile Online discussion
&lt;a href='http://www.playnileonline.com/'>Immortal Cities: Nile Online &amp;#187; Ancient Egyptian browser-based Empire Builder&lt;/a>

Bread is the currency, and one loaf of bread is consumed to make each worker work for one hour. So, since bread and &quot;man-hour&quot; are the most basic resources, let's try to express this in a shorter notation: 1B -> 1Lh.
What it takes to make B is 1Lh -> 8Wheat, 1Lh + 12Wheat -> 6B. So 5Lh -> 12B. 1Lh produces 2.4B of value. However, 1Lh consumes 1B, so ultimately a worker on the bread production line is creating 1.4B of value per hour.
Then there are the resources, called specialties, which vary in what can be taken from different cities, and the luxury goods that can be made from them. Jewelry is made by consuming 1 emerald and 1 gold.
1Lh -> 1Gold, 1Lh -> 1Emerald, 1Emerald + 1Gold + 1Lh -> 1Jewelry. 1Jewelry is 3Lh, which is 7.2B if you put that many people in the pan production line. If you observe the market (well, it depends on where your town is located), you can buy 1Jewelry for 8B, and some foolish players who increased production without thinking too much and couldn't hold enough stock sell it for 7B. If you want to produce it yourself, you need to get Emerald from the market or trade, because you can only produce Gold yourself. 1Lh will get you 2.4B. So if I buy it for 3, I get 3B + 2Lh, so 7.4B. But when I sell it on the market, 10% of the listing fee is deducted, so even if I list it at 8B, the sales will be 7.2B. That's not profitable. Unless you have an environment where you can sell it at a higher price, otherwise it's a loss to produce more than you need yourself, and you'd rather buy it all at the market since you're not likely to recoup your investment in building production facilities. Oh, if you build a second town, you can produce both resources on your own, so if you can't buy them for 8B on the market, then building one could be a reasonable option. Well, it depends on whether there are players nearby who are foolish enough to build an overstock and sell it at a discount.

If you're doing off-market transactions using boats, you might need it, though, because with access frequency of once a day or so, it's a pain to talk to people and wait for their responses and reply to their reactions in a timely manner to wrap up negotiations, you know?

The biggest enemy of leisurely play is overflowing warehouses. Especially secondary production. If the warehouses are not filled to capacity, the secondary production factories will consume resources and labor, and the products will be thrown away without being stored.... For example, clay overflow is 1Lh -> 5Clay, 1Lh -> 5Reed, 2Clay + 1Reed + 1Lh -> 1Brick. 8Lh -> 5Brick, so 19.2B. 1Brick would cost 3.84 to produce. If the warehouse overflows, this cost is lost as it is. It would take 2.7 people working on the bread production line to make up that loss.

Since B is the only resource that will not overflow the warehouse and Lh is the only resource that cannot be saved in the early stages of the project, I think we should first aim to expand the bread production line and put all Lh into it. However, in the process, bricks and baskets will be needed, so it will be necessary to produce them as well. Then we can expand the warehouse and upgrade the market.
