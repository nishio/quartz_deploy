Oh no, it's hard to choose 5 people to go. I want to send everyone I know, &quot;Look what I wrote! I managed to choose 5 people, but I'm afraid I have to send out an e-mail asking for their addresses. What should I write in such a mail? Ugh.

I am not sure about the Purchasing Role in the registration section. I entered it at random and registered.



http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=Static&amp;d1=dev&amp;d2=support&amp;d3=devGettingStarted

I heard I should read this. No, it's component competitions and I wanted to do algorithm competitions (held weekly), maybe.



http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=Static&amp;d1=calendar&amp;d2=thisMonth

This seems to be the schedule for the weekly event. Blue. I think it's next Wednesday night at 9:00pm. I wonder how long it will take; I think I heard an hour and a half so I can do it at work and go home when it's over. I think I heard an hour and a half, so I can do it at work and then go home. All times are Eastern Time unless otherwise stated. When I registered, they asked me what time zone I was in, so I thought of course I had converted it. 9pm Eastern Standard Time means...let's see...11am the next day?

http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=Static&amp;d1=help&amp;d2=getStarted#whatisarena

Read the following. Pressing Launch Arena on the left menu launches the program in JWS. At first, a cool screen was launched. I was able to log in.

Double click on his name and you'll see that he's an Argentine student and a C++ user, and you'll see a one-line profile of what he put in Quote.


I found someone else's source code when I pressed &quot;Summary&quot; at random. Is that the extent of the problem? I'll do it in Java for now, or I'll do it in C++ to study C++.

By the way, contrary to what you might imagine, I don't know C++ at all. I just learned that #include&lt;algorithm> is about STL. I wonder why I should study it.

Solving. (in Python)

Hmmm.
I'll try it in C++ as well. When I open the issue, *.cpp is created locally. Open it. Write something appropriate, save it, and then go to the TopCoder app and do Save, Compile, Test. Save, Compile, Test in the TopCoder app and select test case #1. Oh, it passes.

#line 96 &quot;MinDifference.cpp&quot;
#include &lt;string>
#include &lt;vector>
class MinDifference {
	public:
	int closestElements(int A0, int X, int Y, int M, int n) {
	  return 6;
	}
};
||&lt;
I tried SUBMIT and got 209 points. Hmmm... I wonder if this is good as long as others don't Challenge me. I wonder what would happen if I prepare a program that generates an obfuscated code that can only be correct for that test case when a test case is entered. I wonder if there is no punishment for Challenge failure... Then I would just Challenge the code that is doing something weird like that...

STL

I was going to read and study other people's (especially RedCoder's) code, but I can't copy and paste.

http://www.umechando.com/software/
>&quot;Coppit! is a simple tool for copying text strings that cannot be copied by normal methods, such as descriptions on dialog boxes or selected lines in list boxes.

Mwah, I can't grab it.

Then, open the saved file and delete the unwanted characters before and after. Done.

I can understand if it's HTTP, but it's too much trouble to parse the query since it's being sent in binary via TCP. I wonder if I can make a program to cut out and save the next null character if there is an &quot;#include&quot; string in the returned packet.

I wonder if we should not echo this, but rather have the client send it to the server and the server throw it to the client~?

Time is up for today. I was chastised for being late, and for the past three days neither amachang nor I have been late. Gradually, the time of arrival and departure shifted backwards, and as of 23:00, there are still two of us left. This might be a flag that one of us will be late tomorrow.
