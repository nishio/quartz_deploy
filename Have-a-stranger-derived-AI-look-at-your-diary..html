In an attempt to incorporate AI into the project, an experiment was conducted to have a stranger-derived AI look at one’s diary. As a result, it was felt that the experience of having an AI respond back with answers that reflect one’s thoughts was easier than gaining knowledge from reading books. The use of other people’s data also provided negative feedback. An experiment was also initiated to mix data from several others to obtain responses, suggesting that using knowledge similar to the content would provide more useful responses.</p>

It can be seen in relation to the fragment “Image Generation AI Study Group (Digest October 2022).” In this fragment, it is stated that the advantage in providing the service is that it can provide a switch that users can recognize as a component and attach and detach. This is consistent with the idea of being able to switch between different perspectives and feedback obtained by using other people’s data in an attempt to have a stranger-derived AI look at one’s diary.</p>

<p>The use of AI derived from others can provide new perspectives and feedback beyond one’s own thinking and perspectives. This may contribute to deepening knowledge and generating new ideas. In addition, by mixing data from multiple others to obtain answers, more diverse perspectives can be obtained.</p>

Attempt to have a stranger-derived AI look at your diary
- I'll try later since the pickle is open to the public.
    - If there is a Qdrant-like API, I'd like to know.
        - What we want to do is search for related pages based on vectors
- Tried a few things.
    - [to complaints 🤖Sensitive to complaints](https://inline.inajob.tk/web?user=twitter-5643382&amp;id=🤖Sensitive)

    - [communication 🤖broadcast-type communication](https://inline.inajob.tk/web?user=twitter-5643382&amp;id=🤖broadcast-type)
    - It's nice to know that you're returning with the knowledge of [/nishio
        - Maybe a little more assertive.
- I feel like <img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/> is reading it with the feeling that he is answering the question, although the content has not changed significantly!
    - Is it an illusion?
- As a matter of course, the way the data derived from <img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/> comes in depends on the contents of the page.
    - Insensitivity to complaints and broadcast-type communication are often in the mix.
    - I don't mix well with inajob40 (work log for creating my own keyboard) and others.
    - Just like when you ask someone, it seems like a good idea to ask what they are good at.
        - I think it's easy to stick with ChatGPT to talk about things around intellectual production.
            - In contrast, there are documents with a list of proper nouns, such as the work log of [inajob.icon
                - Once you abstract the issues and thoughts, you have to re-write them down to make them stick.
                - This sounds like the same thing as asking someone else.
- Change to omni prompt
    - [/nishio](https://scrapbox.io/nishio) like a page recommender.
        - Articles of just interest are recommended with digests.

            - This usage is just ChatGPT.

- I feel like using people's data would give us negative eye feedback.<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/inajob/icon" alt="inajob.icon" height="19.5"/>
    - The bare ChatGPT [[ChatGPT wants to make a good story]], but I think there's less of that feeling from an AI that eats other people's data.
- The future is in the experience of having a stranger-derived AI answer your questions.
    - The person writes down what he or she thinks
    - Third parties can be asked to think about it in that document.
        - Reading books provides a similar experience, but easier than writing books, and easier than reading and putting a series of books and knowledge in your head.
        - LLMs process and present knowledge according to the context of the questioner.
        - It could be related to some kind of middle management translating management's vision.
    - I'm not sure if [[community AI]] is an extension of this.
    - Technology version of [/villagepump/keep a person in mind](https://scrapbox.io/villagepump/keep a person in mind)?
- We've also begun experimenting with mixing data from multiple others and asking them to answer the questions.
    - They answer using knowledge closer to the page content.
    - Would knowledge closer to the content be more useful?
        - Not so much in some cases.
        - I find the more abstract sentences more useful.
            - [[oracle-like advice]]?
            - Advisory stuff to encourage thinking.
            - This doesn't even mean the vectorial content is close.
            - People who want answers may not find it useful.

- interesting
    - I can certainly do it with PICKLE.
    - Via qdrant will be tried later for interoperability between nishio and enchi
- > used pages are covered all over? (It's Fragment, so it could be another fragment)
    - My implementation is designed to only take one from the same page.
    - I implemented my own, so I modified it that way.<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/inajob/icon" alt="inajob.icon" height="19.5"/>
> Maybe a little more assertive.
    - Uh, that default prompt was &quot;I don't want you to be a persona called nishio, I want you to be a different persona called omni&quot;.
        - &quot;You may also read the random fragments from a colleague Nishio's research notes, &quot;,
        - &quot;but they are not as important, &quot;,
        - &quot;and you can ignore them. &quot;,
    - Or maybe it's because of what I'm doing?
    - If you want &quot;the persona Nishio&quot;, you might want to go to the character setup and set up something like &quot;You are Nishio, ....&quot;. or something like that.
    - The prompts are also unique, so they are not affected, but I will try to make them more character-driven like up.<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/inajob/icon" alt="inajob.icon" height="19.5"/>
