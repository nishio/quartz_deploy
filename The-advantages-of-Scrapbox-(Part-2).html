<li>I wrote it and talked about it in a one-hour study session and only got about 40% of the way through.</li>
<li>I got confused about whether the object of bracketing is a noun or a verb, which is not the main issue.
<ul>
<li>The main point I wanted to convey was that “the sense of <code>#tags</code> tends to generate an implicit assumption that only nouns are allowed, but this is not the case, and you are free to use verbs and short sentences as well.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I opened all the links and started explaining.
<ul>
<li>Time estimates were not accurate.
2019-01-28 After putting in the time, the language has improved.</li>

<li>
<p>What is Scrapbox?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is a collaborative editing wiki that does not require an explicit save action.</p>
<ul>
<li>I could explain that, but they probably wouldn’t get it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Information storage services focused on minimizing the cost of expressing links between information</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Links are very beneficial, but if creating links is a hassle, people don’t link as much.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is [Wiki</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a “title” on the page where the content is written, and</li>
<li>For example, a link can be made by <code>[[title]]</code> “Wiki Notation”.</li>
<li>hypertext</li>
<li>What was <code>&lt;a href=&quot;http://example.com/title&quot;>title&lt;/a></code> in “Hypertext Markup Language” (HTML) is now <code>[[title]]</code> in Wiki notation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Scrapbox</p>
<ul>
<li>I pushed it further and <code>[Title.]</code> now makes it a link.</li>
<li>You can write so directly, or just select a part of the existing text and press <code>[</code> to make it a link there.</li>
<li>This “act of creating a link” is called [bracketing</li>
<li>Pressing [ while typing a sentence automatically inserts closing parentheses.
<ul>
<li>A fuzzy search is then run in real-time according to the string entered, and existing links are suggested.</li>
<li>Demonstration: I’m going to do “suggestions” here.
<ul>
<li><a href="./Scrapbox's-link-suggestions-are-useful" class="internal alias" data-slug="Scrapbox's-link-suggestions-are-useful">Scrapbox’s link suggestions are useful</a></li>

</ul>

<p><a href="./Link-Concepts" class="internal alias" data-slug="Link-Concepts">Link Concepts</a></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="./link" class="internal" data-slug="link">link</a> and <a href="./tag" class="internal" data-slug="tag">tag</a> and <a href="./page-title" class="internal alias" data-slug="page-title">page title</a> are pretty close in meaning</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because the concept is new, there is no word that can refer to the concept of Scrapbox links, tags, and page titles in one word</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>#tag</code> <code>[link]</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>#tag</code> and <code>[tag]</code> are functionally identical</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tags look like what we call labels or hashtags.</p>
<ul>
<li>Because of this, people who have experience with existing tools that “allow more flexible <a href="./liquidation" class="internal" data-slug="liquidation">liquidation</a> than <a href="./hierarchical-classification" class="internal alias" data-slug="hierarchical-classification">hierarchical classification</a> by tagging the target” tend to misunderstand that “that’s what it is, isn’t it?</li>
<li>You can use it that way, but that way throws away an important part of Scrapbox’s functionality and is quite wasteful.</li>
<li>It is important to be able to tag = link words in a sentence (= bracketing)</li>
<li>for some reason
<ul>
<li>In an information organization system that attaches “tags” separately from contents, “tags” are “attached” to “pages”.</li>
<li><img src="https://gyazo.com/574365e195c7f430d96495c081b72df6/thumb/1000" alt="image"/></li>
<li>It doesn’t mean anything more than “attached.”</li>
<li>On the other hand, when bracketing a word or phrase in a sentence, there is a “<a href="./Surrounding-context" class="internal alias" data-slug="Surrounding-context">Surrounding context</a>” of the word

</ul>
</li>
<li>This is a common practice in wikis.</li>
<li>I wonder if anyone who is caught up in the idea of a hashtag-style information organizer would tag “bracketing” for this sentence
<ul>
<li>Tends to include “category names” like `#books<a href="./tags/diary" class="tag-link internal alias" data-slug="tags/diary">diary</a><a href="./tags/minutes" class="tag-link internal alias" data-slug="tags/minutes">minutes</a>
<ul>
<li>The idea of hierarchical classification by folders has been dragged out.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Instead of organizing by fitting into a known structure top-down, it’s better to connect unexpected things bottom-up.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a feature inherited from the Wiki, the title of the page becomes the link target</p>
<ul>
<li>At the end of the link <code> [bracketing]</code>, there is a page titled “Bracketing”.</li>
<li>Used differently from <code>#book</code> style tags because it brackets important words in a sentence and is also a page title
- <a href="./The-fool-learns-from-experience,-the-wise-learn-from-history" class="internal alias" data-slug="The-fool-learns-from-experience,-the-wise-learn-from-history">The fool learns from experience, the wise learn from history</a> or other short sentences that can be used as links in their entirety.
- The page with that title has a commentary about that short article.

<li>Bracketing verbs: <a href="./rot" class="internal" data-slug="rot">rot</a>.
<ul>
<li>If you follow this <a href="./rot" class="internal" data-slug="rot">rot</a>, it leads to [Liquefaction of knowledge</li>
<li>Key phrases in noun form often tend to be [abstract concept</li>
<li>On the other hand, verbs are often close to [metaphor</li>
<li>It is easy to generate the assumption that “it must end in one or a few noun words.”

</li>
<li>Humans are incapable of understanding and following complex rules.</li>
<li>The requirement to write in the proper place in the hierarchical structure becomes progressively more difficult.</li>
<li>When difficult demands are imposed, people stop writing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the other hand, there are tools out there with the idea that we should stop organizing and find them through search…</p>
<ul>
<li>To be found in search (unless vague search evolves more), you need to search with exact keywords</li>
<li>That’s impossible for humans.</li>
<li>It is impossible to keep them in the right place according to the hierarchical structure, and it is also impossible to properly attach the right keywords and properly search for them when you search for them.</li>

</li>

<p>So, the concept of [sweet potato search</p>

<p>In <a href="./Scrapbox-Information-Organization" class="internal alias" data-slug="Scrapbox-Information-Organization">Scrapbox Information Organization</a>, <a href="./Tadanori-Kurashita" class="internal alias" data-slug="Tadanori-Kurashita">Tadanori Kurashita</a> divided the history of information organization into three categories</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Information Organization 1.0: Location-based Organization</p>
<ul>
<li>Things can only exist in one place at a time.</li>
<li>The same idea applies to placing files in a hierarchy of folders.</li>
<li>If something can’t be clearly defined where it’s located, it’s out of order.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Information Organization 2.0: Don’t Organize, Arrange</p>
<ul>
<li>Arrange them in order of update or access, rather than trying to organize them.</li>
<li>Find by search
<ul>
<li>Search = Refine</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Google has been successful in aligning by PageRank</li>
<li>Services without a good ranking method tend to be “sorted by update time”, etc.</li>
<li>Sorting by access order is a rule of thumb that “things that have been used recently are used more often again”.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Information Organization 3.0:.</p>
<ul>
<li>Networked organization, connected by links</li>
<li>Place it <a href="./in-a-frequently-used-location" class="internal alias" data-slug="in-a-frequently-used-location">in a frequently used location</a>” is often used to organize physical objects
<ul>
<li>Dishes and knives are usually kept near the kitchen.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When certain information is used, the information that <a href="./relevance" class="internal" data-slug="relevance">relevance</a> to it is used more often.
<ul>
<li>→ Linkage by relevance of information to realize “<a href="./place-near" class="internal alias" data-slug="place-near">place near</a>”.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Relevance” is not only mechanically based, but also subjective to each individual.
<ul>
<li>So it must be easy for humans to output that <a href="./Subjective-association" class="internal alias" data-slug="Subjective-association">Subjective association</a>.</li>
<li>Scrapbox facilitated the related outputs by simplifying the notation of links to the extreme</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subjective and objective associations</p>
<ul>
<li>I don’t know what the reason is for the “suggestions of related articles” that are often attached to blogs, etc.</li>
<li>On the other hand, in the case of Scrapbox, “things with a common tag” are connected by the name of the tag.</li>
<li>That “tag=link” was given by me in the past.</li>
<li>Manually selected words used to calculate distances <a href="./Recommendation-Engine" class="internal alias" data-slug="Recommendation-Engine">Recommendation Engine</a>.</li>
<li>Manual selection = <a href="./white-list" class="internal alias" data-slug="white-list">white list</a>.
<ul>
<li>Recommendation engine implementations eliminate words that are not useful for recommendations by calling them [stopword</li>
<li>This is a blacklist.</li>
<li>When I used to build a recommendation engine with Cybozu-style article data, an unexpected word got in the way.
<ul>
<li>Due to the large number of interactive articles, the “person’s name” becomes an overwhelmingly high-frequency word.</li>
<li>As a result, recommending by cosine similarity based on the frequency of occurrence of the word, or recommending by “the same person is in the dialogue article”.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Scrapbox is a whitelist, not a blacklist, and the recommendations are not a blackbox, nor is the behavior understandable
<ul>
<li>Not “I don’t know what it is, but it was recommended to me” but “This article contains the same tag.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explains the function of what is called a link or tag</p>
<ul>
<li>The word “link” gives the misconception that it is a connection between things that already exist.</li>
<li>The term “tag” is ambiguous, and different people have different images of it, but I think it can be easily thought of as a predetermined mark, like a Twitter hashtag, that has nothing to do with the text, but makes it easier to put it all together later.</li>
<li>Scrapbox is quite different, more like a “page title” concept</li>
<li><a href="./Link-to-the-Future" class="internal alias" data-slug="Link-to-the-Future">Link to the Future</a></li>
<li>Links are identified by color</li>
<li>External links are underlined, connected links are blue, unconnected links are red.
<ul>
<li>The identification method of, well, it’s hard to tell at first glance, isn’t it?
<ul>
<li>The telomere-based obsolescence indicator is also hard to understand, but I’ll explain that elsewhere.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bracketing” as if highlighting important key phrases in a sentence
<ul>
<li>At this point, the target string becomes a “link”.</li>
<li>Internal links as they are not external links.</li>
<li>This link is blue if they are connected, red if they are not.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Of course there are “unconnected links,” and that’s not an unusual state of affairs.
<ul>
<li>I haven’t quantitatively examined it, but there are probably a large number of “unconnected links” out there.</li>
<li>We don’t link because we think it’s connected, we bracket because we think it’s important.</li>
<li>This would unexpectedly result in several blue links.</li>
<li>Connections to other pages are discovered after the fact.</li>
<li>The phrase “<a href="./Link-to-the-Future" class="internal alias" data-slug="Link-to-the-Future">Link to the Future</a>” was a surprisingly blue link, even though I thought I’d just thought of it.
<ul>
<li>Unfortunately, there was no <a href="./beneficial" class="internal" data-slug="beneficial">beneficial</a> information at the link.</li>
<li>However, this blue link has led me to the idea of a “link to the future” in the past.</li>
<li>Of course, when I first wrote this “<a href="./Link-to-the-Future" class="internal alias" data-slug="Link-to-the-Future">Link to the Future</a>” it was “[A link that leads nowhere.</li>
<li>If you’ve thought about it in the past, why not <a href="./search-(e.g.-for-someone-using-a-search-engine)" class="internal alias" data-slug="search-(e.g.-for-someone-using-a-search-engine)">search (e.g. for someone using a search engine)</a> with “future + link” and [we’ll find something.</li>
<li>I tried.

<li>I didn’t include it because I didn’t understand its value at the time of planning and writing <a href="./The-Intellectual-Production-of-Engineers" class="internal alias" data-slug="The-Intellectual-Production-of-Engineers">The Intellectual Production of Engineers</a>, but I would definitely include it if I were planning it now.</li>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is difficult to perceive value unless a certain amount of bracketed text exists.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you don’t feel it’s worth it, don’t spend time putting down sentences or writing and bracketing them.
<ul>
<li><a href="./Chicken-and-Eggs" class="internal alias" data-slug="Chicken-and-Eggs">Chicken and Eggs</a> issue</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="./Scrapbox-is-a-notebook" class="internal alias" data-slug="Scrapbox-is-a-notebook">Scrapbox is a notebook</a></li>
<li>Just as notebooks can be used in a variety of ways, Scrapbox can be used in other ways as well.</li>
<li>For example, taking advantage of the ability for collaborative editing, minutes of a meeting can be taken by multiple people in real time.
<ul>
<li>Discussion is more likely to be useful because the discussion becomes textual.</li>
<li>In the case of doing “one person writes on a laptop and then transfers it to a monitor for everyone to read,” the record is poor if the person taking those minutes participates in the discussion.</li>
<li>When multiple people are co-editing, what one person thinks “should be recorded” is recorded.</li>
<li>Low bullet cost (1 space) and unlimited hierarchy, so there is no constraint to “one dimensionalize” the discussion</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For example, take your own study notes in Scrapbox.
- Bracket <a href="./Words-you-don't-understand" class="internal alias" data-slug="Words-you-don't-understand">Words you don’t understand</a> and write what you researched about the word on the linked page.
<ul>
<li>If you write the definition of a normal distribution in a paper notebook, for example, on a certain day, if you want to refer to it a few days later, it is inconvenient because it is several pages away</li>
<li>If it’s digital, you can link to it.</li>
<li>The cost of that link is low” (just change the string <code>normal distribution</code> to <code> [normal distribution]</code>).</li>
<li>As you take notes, you create a network of knowledge.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I think each is useful, but not quite what I’m focusing on here, “<a href="./Increased-intellectual-productivity" class="internal alias" data-slug="Increased-intellectual-productivity">Increased intellectual productivity</a>”.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Making flow into stock</p>
<ul>
<li>How do we create structured knowledge from everyday interactions (flows)?</li>
<li>People who didn’t even keep the flows and disposed of them.
<ul>
<li>Verbal conversation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All emails are stored and searchable.</li>
<li>Cybozu bulletin boards, Slack, etc.
<ul>
<li>The “letter” metaphor of e-mail has been stripped of its back-and-forth greetings.</li>
<li>Permalinks appear.
<ul>
<li>It will be possible to point to and share “past interactions.”</li>
</ul>

<li>Togetter

<li>Able to discard exchanges on Twitter, rather than simply sorting through them.

<li>Slack permalinks are equivalent to “link to the public timeline at a point in time”</li>

<ul>
<li>So, after-the-fact, only pick up on specific topics.</li>
