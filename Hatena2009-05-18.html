*1242641487* stacked readings
How about a group where people can bring in books they have bought but have been storing and exchange them with others who are interested in them? The rule is that you have to return the book next time, whether you have read it or not.

It suddenly occurred to me.

*1242642824*Tokyo Fever Outpatient Clinic Contact List
Considering the possibility that I was already infected and would develop a fever in the next few days, I thought that it would surely be difficult to find out the telephone number of an outpatient fever clinic after I developed a fever, so I looked it up. In summary, I found that &quot;on weekdays from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., call the public health center, and on weeknights, holidays, and national holidays, call the Tokyo Metropolitan Fever Consultation Center.

I wonder if the Tokyo Metropolitan Government's page that comes up at the top of a search for &quot;outpatient fever&quot; is a page about &quot;what is an outpatient fever clinic&quot; and does not include a phone number.

I bought it on 4/26.

I thought of using kombu (kelp) to make broth as usual, but decided to heat kimchi in a pot since I had kimchi that expired on 3/25 and kimchi that expired on 5/10 that I bought on 4/26 that I was going to heat and eat because it was too sour. This is the first time to make kimchi nabe without using &quot;kimchi nabe no moto&quot;. I also added tofu, which expired on 4/30, and leeks and enoki mushrooms that I bought on 4/26. Neither the leeks nor the bean sprouts had gone bad.

*1242652071*Flash game Pandemic
http://www.crazymonkeygames.com/playnewpandemic.php

A game where you become a virus and kill lots of people while mutating. It's a little inappropriate, but you can learn how viruses spread. The game screen doesn't look great, though. It would be better if it showed more clearly how many people died.

&lt;img src=&quot;http://gyazo.com/d33e125533ed7c8ab31b4bcbb5b0e4a7.png&quot;>

It was easy to wipe out everyone outside of Western Europe, but it's hard to spread the infection to Western Europe, where there are (supposed to be) no airports.

*1242655395*Pandemic Strategy
http://www.crazymonkeygames.com/playnewpandemic.php
Strategy for this game.

&lt;hr>

Incubation Period, survivability outside host, resistance to moisture/heat all cost 4 and infectivity +1, In all likelihood, prolonging the incubation period and prolonging in vitro survival are more effective. I don't understand why visibility is not reduced by prolonging the incubation period.

I thought that turning off fever would lower visibility, but only letherity went down. I am not convinced.

airborne (airborne) was cost 12 and infect. +3, waterborne was cost 18 and infect. +5.

The most cost-effective way to increase infectivity is body fluid (infection by body fluid) cost 4 and infect. +2, right? Oh, and removing HUMAN ONLY costs 2 and +1, so this is the same.

The only ones that reduce visibility are vomit OFF (lethal. -2, infect. -1, visi. -2), sweat OFF (visi. -1), sneeze OFF (infect. -3, visi. -1), cough OFF (lethal, -1, infect. -2 2), cough OFF (lethal, -1, infect. -2, visi. -1), sweat OFF (infect. -3, visi. -1), cough OFF (lethal, -1, infect. -2, visi. -1), sweat OFF at cost 2, vimit OFF at cost 8.

At first, I turned HUMAN ONLY OFF and proceeded for a while. on the 12th day, I reached 50 people, and hmmm. On the 15th day, I turned off vomit after reaching 100 people. At this point, lethal. 2, infect. 5, visi. 2, and now we need to increase the infectivity. Now let's increase the infectivity.

Day 20, airborne. 2, 8, 2. Day 22, body fluid, incubation. 23, North American continent. 24, South American continent. 26, first fatality in North America, but infection has already spread to 50 people. 30, spread to Eastern Europe. At this point, the incubation period and in vitro survival time are maxed out.

Day 31, they cut off public transportation. Day 33, 34, invaded Asia and Australia. lethal. 2, infect. 20, visi. 2. 38, landed on African continent. Day 39, oh, it's finally invaded Western Europe. day 47, waterborne. 2, 27, 2. Well, it's already spread to all land masses, so now it's time for a fulminant disease. First, vomit, which also raises the infectivity...only 1...4, 28, 4...next is immune, 6, 31, 4...now we have to go to the immune system, 6, 31, 4...now we have to go to the vomiting system, 6, 31, 4.

On day 49, the border was closed. But it is already too late. It has already been 10 days since the last entry into Western Europe. The number of infected people in Western Europe has exceeded 10,000. 50th day, BOIL. It has mutated to spread its bodily fluids and die, just like Ebola. That's a pretty big increase in infectivity. 8, 35, 7. 53 days, they took an anticogulant. 9, 37, 7. On day 54, I took hemorrhaging. I don't see much difference between the three...all three are Ebola-like symptoms.

Day 58, necrosis. 15, 45, 13. how does necrosis increase infectivity? On day 60, I got swellings, which I had neglected because I thought they wouldn't be infectious, and they were 17, 45, 15. On day 63, I got organ failure, 21, 45, 16. Just as I imagined. On day 65, I have 135 days left until a vaccine is developed, but there is nothing more to do. I don't think it's possible to make a vaccine with so few humans left. I'll take &quot;weakness&quot; as 22, 44, 18. Does this make them less infectious, or is it because they can't move around?

I ran out of things to do, so I decided to fast-forward from here, and when I did, the game was over after about day 80. It seems that the human race has been wiped out.

&lt;img src=&quot;http://gyazo.com/58e79d087bbe4931c76ae399cf1d75e9.png&quot;>

Ended.

&lt;img src=&quot;http://gyazo.com/a1ea678500ed45e682155555f757a439.png&quot;>

5th place? Well, after understanding the operation the first time and confirming the costs and effects of the main options the second time, it was the third time I played the game, and the basic strategy is as well known. Reduce symptoms without reducing infectivity as much as possible. That way, people will move around and spread the infection, and the alert will be delayed. And then, after it's well spread, you can deleteriousize it. That also emphasizes bleeding and other things that increase infectivity.

Actual viruses do not think like this, &quot;What kind of mutation should I make in order to kill a lot of humans?&quot; But we cannot deny the possibility that the result of a random play that happens to be close to the best possible move. That is why we humans, who have the ability to think, have to exercise our ability to think and fight the virus.
