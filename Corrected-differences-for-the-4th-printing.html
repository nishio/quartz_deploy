English version.
I have improved the parts where I felt ‚Äúthe original Japanese was unclear‚Äù. <a href="./Improvement-for-English-version-(~1-chapter)" class="internal alias" data-slug="Improvement-for-English-version-(~1-chapter)">Improvement for English version (~1 chapter)</a>. This is only a rough note because the priority at the time of writing this was to create the English version. Since it is not in the form of revised diffs, I will make it in the form of revised diffs for the 4th edition.
Note that there are some items written here that will not be included in the fourth edition due to the publisher‚Äôs desire not to include corrections that would change the number of pages in a paper book.</p>
<p>iv
diff:0.1.1</p>
<pre><code>- I believe that generating new knowledge on one's own is important for high-value intellectual production.
+ For high-value intellectual production, it is important to generate new knowledge oneself.

<p>vi
diff:0.2.1</p>
<pre><code>- In addition to reading, &quot;sutra copying,&quot; a technique of imitating and typing, is also often used.
</code></pre>
<p>Considering the simplicity of the story, it would be better not to mention the sutra at this stage.</p>
<p>diff:0.2.1</p>
<pre><code>- This book also presents a number of intellectual production challenges and solutions. This is like sample programming code.
+ Programming textbook presents challenges and the programs that solve them. This book presents challenges and solutions to intellectual production. The same structure.
</code></pre>
<p>The concept of ‚Äúmodel‚Äù is highly abstract, so at this juncture it is better to open it up more concretely to ‚Äúpattern discovery.‚Äù
In conjunction, the title of this section, ‚ÄúAbstraction and Modeling‚Äù should be changed to ‚ÄúCompare and Find Patterns‚Äù. (Another idea
: ‚ÄúAbstraction occurs when patterns are discovered.‚Äú)
The words ‚Äúinformation gathering, modeling, and verification‚Äù in the text of v should also be ‚Äúinformation gathering, abstraction, and verification‚Äù. The same applies to the figure captions. I was concerned that the word ‚Äúabstraction‚Äù was not easy to grasp, but since the figure depicts that ‚Äúabstraction‚Äù is a concept that specifically includes ‚Äúmodeling and pattern discovery,‚Äù there should be no problem.</p>
<p>vii
diff:0.2.2</p>
<pre><code>- In this book, we hope to help you create your own model of intellectual production by comparing intellectual production techniques.
+ In this book, we hope to help you discover common patterns of intellectual production by comparing several intellectual production techniques.
</code></pre>
<p>:</p>
<pre><code>- Now you have the ability to find a pattern and come up with, &quot;If I want to output &quot;Bye, world!&quot; in Python, why don't I just write it this way?&quot; You now have the ability to come up with &quot;If I want to output &quot;Bye, world!
+ What if I want to output &quot;Bye, world!&quot; in Python? Now that you have found the pattern, you have the ability to come up with an implementation.
</code></pre>
<p>viii
diff:0.3</p>
<pre><code>- Chapter 1, &quot;How to Learn Something New,&quot; considers how to learn something for which there is no right answer. It details how to learn through a cycle of learning so that you can apply what you learn to situations rather than memorizing it.
+ Chapter 1 is &quot;How to Learn Something New.&quot; Just learning the answers does not mean that you will be able to apply them to your situation. To acquire the ability to apply, you need to go through a three-phase cycle: information gathering, abstraction, and practice. This chapter will explore each phase in detail.
</code></pre>
<p>ix
diff:0.3</p>
<pre><code>- Many people buy too many books and end up with piles of them.
+ Have you bought too many books and left them unread?
</code></pre>
<p>The problem is not that they are physically piled up, but that they are bought but not read.</p>
<p>diff:0.3</p>
<pre><code>- However, I believe that what is a more important question than how. In Chapter 7, &quot;How to Decide What to Learn,&quot; we will consider this question.
+ However, I believe that deciding what to learn is more important than devising how to learn. Chapter 7, &quot;How to Decide What to Learn,&quot; describes decision-making strategies for deciding what to learn.

<li>Consider, for example, the process by which a book is written. Before writing a book, the author has many specific experiences. However, it is not possible to write everything in a book. Most of the specific information is stripped away.

<li>Boxes can collapse while being stacked. Math knowledge is a true square block. On the other hand, blocks in other areas of the field are a bit snug. In mathematics, the blocks are stacked so precisely that you can build very tall towers. You can reach a very high level of abstraction. But in other fields, if you try to stack them in the same way as in mathematics, they collapse. So you have to collect a lot of information and stack it like a pyramid, with many boxes to support it.</li>

<li>Math knowledge is a true square block, but blocks in other areas are a bit snooty. True square blocks can be stacked precisely, so you can build very tall towers.

<ul>
<li>Suppose you can copy, say, 5 pages in 25 minutes. If the textbook is 300 pages, the estimate is that it would take 25 hours to copy the entire book. Looking at this estimate, you may be discouraged, thinking, ‚ÄúI have to spend 25 hours. But that is a mistake.</li>
<li>Scripture is not the objective. The goal is for you to be able to understand the textbook. The sutra is like an auxiliary wheel until you can ride a bicycle. When you read a book and have no understanding of it, it is the same as when you ride a bicycle and keep falling over and not moving forward. By putting on an auxiliary wheel, you will be able to move forward. And as they ride with the wheels, they improve their riding skills and become able to ride without the wheels.</li>
<li>If you look vaguely at a book you read but do not understand, you will not feel that you have gained anything. On the other hand, if you do sutra copying, your writing will remain in a form. This is easier to maintain your motivation. This is the effect of having a clear goal. And it is easier to stay motivated if your goal is not 25 hours from now, but 25 minutes from now. This is the effect of making the goal closer, as we learned in ‚ÄúTutorials Make the Goal Closer‚Äù (page 10)</li>
<li>As you learn more and more efficiently, you will feel less and less need for sutra copying. You will realize why I compared sutra chanting to an auxiliary wheel.

- Using Models for [Saving Thought
- > Models are simplified representations to explain how the real world works. Since the phenomena occurring in the real world are complex, we simplify them by trimming away the unimportant parts so that even limited human cognitive abilities can handle them. For example, in high school physics, air resistance and friction are assumed to be non-existent. The air resistance and friction that exist in the real world are ignored to simplify the problem so that high school students can handle it.
