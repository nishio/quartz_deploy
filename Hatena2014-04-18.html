*1397822972*Diary of U Theory in Practice
According to the U Theory, in order to crystallize a new understanding, it is necessary to discard once and for all the old preoccupations. When I introspectively asked myself, &quot;What am I obsessing about?&quot; I found that I was still obsessing about the fact that as long as I read a book, I must understand its contents. So I experimented to see what would happen if I threw this away and continued to read so fast that I could not explain the contents of the book.

As a result, my thinking about &quot;comprehension&quot; has changed.


I have been using the concept of &quot;comprehension&quot; without any particular doubts until now. But what is comprehension? Is it the percentage of information in a book that I understood?

This definition is not useful. First, I don't know the &quot;total amount of information in a book,&quot; so I can't know how much I understand a book without understanding 100% of its content. Second, the more time you spend, the higher the value tends to be. And finally, &quot;100% comprehension&quot; is not necessarily a desirable state.

Even if one were able to explain the contents of a book perfectly, it would only be a degraded copy of the author. That alone does not create any value to society. To create new value, you need to make it easier to understand, shorter, or combine it with other things.... Putting the contents of a book into the brain is preparation for creating value, and it is not right to make it an end in itself.

On the other hand, expressions such as &quot;I read too fast and lost my comprehension&quot; are useful. What is the &quot;comprehension level&quot; used here? I think it is better to think of &quot;comprehension&quot; here as &quot;the amount of understanding gained per unit of time,&quot; rather than &quot;the amount of information in the book that I was able to understand. A situation in which new understanding is gained one after another is enjoyable. It is not enjoyable when there is little to gain. However, if, for example, &quot;I was casually flipping through a book and found something interesting! the percentage of understanding gained in relation to the entire book is very small, but per unit of time it is very large. Is this situation fun or not? It is fun. Then &quot;amount of understanding gained per unit of time&quot; is a more appropriate measure.

By the way, this word &quot;understanding&quot; could also use some clarification. Even if you copy 100% of what is written in a book into your brain, it does not create value by itself. This means that the definition &quot;understanding means copying the contents of a book into your brain&quot; is not appropriate. When is the content of a book useful? When you find a solution to a problem you have been struggling with, or when you become aware of your own assumptions or mistakes. In other words, isn't it when the knowledge you had inside you and the knowledge in the book are combined?

If you are stuck in the framework of &quot;understanding the contents of a book = copying the contents of the book to the brain,&quot; you will not find any value in the new combination created here. This is because the &quot;combination&quot; is not the &quot;contents of the book.

How can we increase &quot;comprehension = amount of binding per unit of time&quot;? Reading at an appropriate speed is one solution. If a problem is too gentle for one's ability, one is bored, and if a problem is too difficult, one is stressed. Flow is somewhere in between. Similarly, if your reading speed is too slow for your ability, the denominator will increase and your comprehension will decrease. If the reading speed is too fast, the numerator decreases and comprehension falls. At a moderate speed, comprehension peaks.

The peaks are much on the fast side than previously assumed; by reading several books a day, you will find unexpected &quot;joins between books&quot;. This cannot be achieved if you are locked into &quot;reading one book&quot;. Also, if you read too slowly, you cannot get time back, but if you read too fast, you can add time and read again. Given the magnitude of the damage, you should bet on the shorter time.

To enter the stage at the bottom of the U-shape, one has to let go of preconceived notions once. A state of identification with the problem without judgment, such as Csikszentmihalyi's flow state or Kitaro Nishida's pure experience. The experience gathered thereby crystallizes in the next stage, and a new understanding is created.

The Work Shift.&quot;
>>
A discussion of how changes in the social environment expected in the future will require changes (shifts) in the way we work.

The first of the three shifts is the acquisition of continuous expertise and its self-branding. It is important to note that it is not simply &quot;acquiring expertise&quot; but &quot;acquiring continuous expertise. The emphasis is not on gaining expertise in one field and continuing to invest time in maintaining it, but on entering a different field and gaining new expertise there.

I read this book next to a book on negotiation techniques because they happened to be next to each other on the bookshelf, but it was very interesting to see how many times examples of negotiation techniques from the book I had just read appeared in this completely independent book.

I guess one of the benefits of speed reading is that the resources (memory and time) per book are compressed, which allows multiple books to be placed on the limited resources, making it easier to discover relationships across books.

U-theory's talk about the need to let go of the existing once in order to crystallize new concepts, in essence, the trade-off between exploration and utilization in reinforcement learning. If you only use the best method you know so far, you will never encounter a better method. But if we were only trying new things in search of encounters, we would not be able to reap the benefits of using good methods.

I've been reading at a rate that doesn't allow for a good description of what's in it, and I'm wondering, &quot;What's the point?&quot; I ignored the voice from my past self that said, &quot;What's the point?&quot; and I did it anyway, but I'm starting to crystallize. Just because I can now explain the contents of the book over time, does that make sense? I should ask. Even if one could perfectly explain the contents of a book, it would be nothing more than a degraded copy of the author. It has not created any value to society.

To create new value, make it easier to understand, make it shorter, combine it with other things.... Improving comprehension is preparation for the next move, it is not right to make it an objective.

From the viewpoint of pragmatism, which states that the value of knowledge is determined by whether there is any real benefit in using it, the value of reading should be measured by &quot;what is produced&quot; by reading a book.

He said the concept of &quot;comprehension&quot; brings &quot;information in the book&quot; into the denominator,
Denominator unknown until 100% understood.
The more time spent, the higher the value tends to be.
This is an inappropriate measure from the point of view of

On the other hand, expressions such as &quot;I read too quickly and lost my comprehension&quot; are useful. I was thinking about how to fill this gap, but I think it would be more appropriate to think of &quot;comprehension&quot; here as &quot;time&quot; rather than &quot;all the information in the book&quot; as the denominator. In other words, it is &quot;the amount of understanding obtained per unit of time.

The Flow Experience: The Phenomenology of Joy, p332, 10min20
>>
If the problems are too kind for my abilities, I get bored; if the problems are too hard, I get stressed. Flow is somewhere in between.
The story of the elders of a people who lived in an affluent land and began to explore new lands because they thought that if they did not, their young people would be ruined, is the same story as the recent &quot;trade-off between use and exploration,&quot; in which the bias toward use prevents exploration, and the same with the first shift discussed in the work shift, continuous professionalism.

I had read this anecdote before, but was not reminded of it yesterday when I was thinking about the &quot;trade-off between use and exploration&quot;. I had thought that for the binding of two pieces of knowledge to take place in the brain, both pieces of knowledge must be recorded in the brain, but even if they are in long-term memory, if they are not recalled, they are meaningless. The stimulus causes the long-term memory to be recalled back to the short-term memory, where the binding takes place. A useful strategy for this &quot;recall&quot; is to read a book once again at high speed.
