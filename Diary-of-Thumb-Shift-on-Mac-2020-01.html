<li>Drawing layout ancho by hand on iPad
<ul>
<li>Added shortcut keys for kana-kanji conversion and cursor movement.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Example Sentence Input Practice</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2nd day
<ul>
<li>I‚Äôm tired of practicing typing example sentences.</li>
<li>Consider example sentences for programming</li>
<li>Create a layout clearing program</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>3rd day
<ul>
<li>The home position stuff is much smoother.</li>
<li>Print out an ancho and attach it to the top of the monitor.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Day 4
<ul>
<li>I‚Äôm tired of practicing only example sentences for home position, so I‚Äôm going to make an example sentence book 2 that uses all the letters.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>5th day
<ul>
<li>I tested how well I remembered the layout, and I didn‚Äôt remember as much as I expected.</li>
<li>Add example sentences to cover what you don‚Äôt remember.</li>
<li>Almost correct on third test.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Day 6
<ul>
<li>Yesterday, the squares and letters were in any order, but I was able to answer correctly, so I put the letters in aieo order <span>‚Üí</span> almost correct.</li>
<li>After practicing yesterday and today, I spend much less time looking for letters.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Days 7-9
<ul>
<li>I skipped practice for three days.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Day 10
<ul>
<li>I was 10% faster while I wasn‚Äôt practicing.</li>
<li>It was found that it takes about 50% more time to input data without looking at Anchoko than when looking at Anchoko.</li>

<ul>
<li>My last thumb shift challenge on a Mac was frustrated when I tried to get Karabiner to recognize simultaneous keystrokes and it didn‚Äôt work.
<ul>
<li>There‚Äôs a desire to ‚Äúdo it with one software rather than two.‚Äù</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I‚Äôm not sure whether to use the recommended configuration of Karabiner+Lacaille or Lacaille alone this time.</li>
<li>But editing the environment itself while training ‚Äúmyself to adapt to the environment‚Äù is a bad idea, so I‚Äôll use the recommended configuration for now.
<ul>
<li>It seems like a good idea to gradually ‚Äúabolish Karabiner without changing its behavior‚Äù after I adapt to it.</li>

<ul>
<li>This time, I‚Äôm not just going to use a thumb shift, I‚Äôm going to use an ‚Äúon-knee keyboard‚Äù.</li>
<li>That‚Äôs why I drew it.</li>

<ul>
<li>It is easier to find the desired letter if you don‚Äôt write anything extra.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I‚Äôll leave the template in case I need to redraw it:)

<li><img src="https://gyazo.com/fba3b995e8101e9f9ba0f9f106ca1bde/thumb/1000" alt="image"/></li>
<li>The bottom row is longer than the top row because the diagram ignores the space between the keys in the actual product.</li>
<li>Instead of opening the gap as in reality, we decided to make the cursor keys a little narrower than in reality</li>

<p><img src="https://gyazo.com/820f29bcb96dafc9f458b0a3135b568d/thumb/1000" alt="image"/>
So this is typed with thumb shift</p>

So I also added a shortcut [/shio/ 4 settings and 1 training#59a4f7459f6c420000b5966a](<a href="https://scrapbox.io/shio/" class="external">https://scrapbox.io/shio/<svg aria-hidden="true" class="external-icon" style="max-width:0.8em;max-height:0.8em;" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><path d="M320 0H288V64h32 82.7L201.4 265.4 178.7 288 224 333.3l22.6-22.6L448 109.3V192v32h64V192 32 0H480 320zM32 32H0V64 480v32H32 456h32V480 352 320H424v32 96H64V96h96 32V32H160 32z"></path></svg></a> 4 settings and 1 training#59a4f7459f6c420000b5966a) for drafting on the new Mac.
I still have a bit of a chip on my shoulder, but I can do a lot better.
The ability to backspace without looking at the hand is a big change.
I have the impression that the quality of the experience has changed dramatically.
Feeling like backspace is not ctrl+h, but moving the left pinky and right index finger to the left.</p>
<ul>
<li>(Flick input) I had difficulty entering the above English letters because I couldn‚Äôt see the keyboard, and I registered ‚Äù‚Üê‚Äù in zh as a word, but I was confused because I couldn‚Äôt get it out.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://gyazo.com/9479da2572ce346f691cf386a1148eec/thumb/1000" alt="image"/>
So I added the English letters as well.

<ul>
<li>root direction</li>
<li>sleazy direction</li>
<li>root drop</li>
<li>sleep‚Üë</li>
<li>Nayoro ‚áî (used as a rough indicator of location, direction, time, etc.)</li>
<li>‚â†‚â†‚â†</li>

</ul>
<p><img src="https://gyazo.com/9479da2572ce346f691cf386a1148eec/thumb/1000" alt="image"/>
I pressed the right command key and triggered an unexpected command.
I changed it to a key with a carabiner because it‚Äôs dangerous.
I see, up until now I‚Äôve been assuming I remember where the English letters are on the keyboard, and commands and such are stacked on top of them.
Something new is happening in the brain with that rearrangement and invisibility.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs been a year and a half since my last practice, and I can type a sentence without too much trouble.
English letters are a challenge Apple Magic Keyboard</p>

To reduce the time spent looking for where it is, you can index it.</p>
<p>Then it‚Äôs time to do the same exercise we did last time.</p>

</ul>
<p>It‚Äôs interesting that I‚Äôm not particularly practicing, but I‚Äôm getting decently fast.
By the way, this measurement is the time required, including error correction, and is close to the time used for actual input.
This is a learning curve for corrective shortcuts, and the cost per mistake is going down.
Not desirable for accuracy-oriented training.
So I‚Äôm going to go back to the ‚Äúif you make a mistake, start over with a new line‚Äù that I did in the early days.</p>
