<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>I would like to think about a non-chat form of Keichobot
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>What kind of “Keichobot” is this “Keichobot”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>It was originally called a chat system to encourage verbalization, but some users used it for Scrapbox instead of chat, which made me think that it could be a form of non-chat.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>What kind of “chat” is that “chat”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>While Kozaneba is called “digital stationery for organizing thoughts,” this one is a chatbot for “drawing out thoughts.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>Is there anything else about that “chat”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>I was originally positive about chat because it has the effect of repeatedly interacting with programs and humans to extract information from humans, or to focus humans on a single subject for a certain period of time, but there are some disadvantages, so we should explore other forms of chat as well.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>Where is this “chat” located?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>The image of being in front of the user and interacting with him or her. The new form is not like that.

</li>
<li>Where is this “chat” located?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>The current chat is like going to a chat room when you have a purpose and saying, “I have this kind of consultation…“. The new form is not like that, but rather, the bot talks to you, or when you reload your timeline in your spare time, the bot is tweeting there.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>What does that “chat” look like?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Face-to-face communication with physical restraints

</li>
<li>How do you know about this “chat”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Somehow made it into a form of chat, no deep meaning.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>What is its “shape”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>The way communication should be. Different forms of what people want from bots?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>What is it that you value?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>The fact that it is a form of chat has no deep meaning, and it is not good if we get caught up in it and overlook the benefits of the new form. In short, I feel that the value lies in the fact that software facilitates intellectual production, and that the means should not be limited to chat.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>Where does this “chat” come from?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>This is rather clear, and it is obvious that reworking ELIZA with today’s technology would create value, because even the technology of the time was valuable.

</li>
<li>What do you hope will happen regarding this “chat”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>As a chat, it seems to have stabilized in a rather certain ecological niche, and there is currently no opportunity to break the barriers. It would be nice if bots were forced to adapt to a different environment than chat, thereby creating new opportunities for evolution.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>What needs to happen to the “chat” for that to happen?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>We should stop chatting for once.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>

</li>
<li>Is there anything else you can tell us about this “form”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Twitter bots that push notifications, Twitter bots that tweet irrespective of humans, Twitter bots that read multiple people’s Scrapboxes and tweet their thoughts, services that return questions when you pass articles such as Scrapbox, and task decomposition support bots for task management systems
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>What is the relationship between this “bot” and “chat”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>They’ve been tightly coupled, but they should be disconnected.

<li>Where does this “form” come from?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>There are things that humans want others to do to them, but when actual humans do them, they are not done unless both parties benefit, and there are forms of communication that are possible because one party is a bot.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>What is the relationship between its “form” and “chat”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>For example, in a chat, I can start a chat because I want to go for a walk now, without the other person’s convenience, and I can take as much time as I want to reply, or I can go into a convenience store, but the bot will reply without making the human wait.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>Is that “bot” the same as “chat”? Is it different?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Right now, a bot is just a program to deal with such chats, but essentially it is a system that can read a coherent text, find keywords, and produce output based on that information.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>What happens to the “chat” when its a “bot”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Chat has transformed from a tool for individuals to communicate as equals to a stationery tool that can be used by one person to organize thoughts.

<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>It needs to change by contingency, not by human design of how to change it.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>As for “bots,” can they do it?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>I’d have to design it in such a way that it could be changed by contingencies.

<li>How do you know this “form”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Because you don’t expect it, after it changes, you look at it and say, “Oh, I see, this is the way it’s supposed to look.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>Is that “form” the same as “chat”? Is it different?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Apparently not.
