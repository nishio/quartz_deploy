<li>There is another group above with a large number of elements, but this one is connected to the outside world a lot, so it’s not much of a problem.</li>
<li>The group below has become isolated.
<ul>
<li>It’s like having a group of people from the same high school all talking at a college freshers’ party.</li>

<li>The original had exactly the same thin black lines connecting the labels and the enclosure.</li>

<li>The center sticky, “What do you want to do with X?” was mentioned that the “X” was changed to “X”.

<li>I had to go through…</li>

<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>I have a delicate problem where to place the first sticky from the center sticky,..,</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>At first, it’s fine if it’s appropriate. From the second sticky, the influence of “positional relationship with already placed stickies” becomes stronger and stronger.</li>

<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>Sharing of my realization: I found myself trying to extend the arrows in four directions from the center due to the square shape of the sticky notes. By thinking of the theme in three dimensions, I would like to connect the two-dimensional preconceptions.</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>In that sense, it would be a good idea not to align them perfectly horizontally or vertically, but to dare to place them at an appropriate angle.</li>

<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>I’m not sure if I’ll be able to extend the sticky note from the center with a sticky note in front of it, but my hand is pretty much stuck.</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Well, you are all very skilled, and if this were the case, I would not have needed to have the labels prepared in advance.
<ul>
<li>Making stickies in advance is just “to extend the work time that may be missing”.</li>
<li>So I think it is better to leave it by your side once than to let it stop you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Supplemental:.
<ul>
<li>If we do a second session, maybe instead of “please go make 25 labels,” the advance preparation should be “put the theme in the middle, add the associations as labels, draw a line, repeat 25 times, and leave it with a branch growing.</li>

<ul>
<li>Supplemental:.
<ul>
<li>By not being used to “drawing the line,” we tend to unconsciously avoid drawing the line!</li>
<li>So the intent was, “If you’re not sure, let’s make it a line.</li>
<li>The “if it’s not an exact match” was superfluous, but that’s not the rule.
<ul>
<li>It’s rather worthless to put labels side by side with exact matches.</li>

<li>This was the age of no computers, so I made a tearful effort to use clips to display the relationships while allowing the labels to be moved later!</li>
<li>I think the following interpretation would be easy to realize this with the current tools
<ul>
<li>Generally, “relationship” is “one line.”</li>
<li>The “conflict relationship” is “two-headed arrow ↔.”</li>
<li>Similar relationships, sets, and sequences are arranged without lines.</li>

<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>A: The first step is to create a tightly connected net.

<li>Because the “conclusion” you made before it was made was just what you originally had.</li>

<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>I try to avoid intersections as much as possible, but there are limits to two dimensions, so there are times when intersections do occur.

  - I see! Let me put it another way.
      - For a group of stickies, it comes to mind, &quot;This group's nameplate is X, right?&quot;
      - But instead of making it a table-top at one level higher than the elements of the group, dare to make it a sticky at the same level as the elements of the group.
      - There's something nice about doing that.

      - 1: Every element of the group is a little different from each other, even the same family has different personalities.
      - 2: To put nameplate X on that group is to ignore individuality and make it &quot;X family&quot;.
      - 3: On the other hand, if X is the new label
      - 4: Bring coordinate axes into the group, such as &quot;labels that are close to X&quot; and &quot;labels that are not so close to X
      - 5: Provides a means to get a more complete picture of the group

<li>(looking at the map) I see, that there are many labels for questions.</li>

<li>We’re clearly making more progress than we were at the stage where the hook wasn’t ready yet.</li>
<li>You can’t predict when a fish will be hooked.</li>
<li>Questions that can be answered quickly are not important questions.

<li>I just posed the question with what I originally knew the answer to.</li>

<li>And then you leave it and do something else, and then you think, “Oh, that’s the answer to the question I just asked.</li>

</ul>
<p>Impression 1</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>It’s exciting when stickies with completely different thought paths stick together and make sense:boom:.

<li>Connections are discovered between “different branches” with different thought paths.</li>
<li>It’s fun to pay attention to this “awareness” and to notice even more!</li>
<li>If you rearrange these red “newly discovered connections” to shrink them, you will see a different structure than you had previously assumed</li>

<p>Impression 2</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>1: It’s interesting that stickies created through a game of association can unexpectedly turn out to be the core part of the game. It’s interesting.
<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>2: Sticky notes are sometimes the key because you don’t think you have to write properly!</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>That’s good! What?” Isn’t this what you were looking for?” That’s what you’re looking for, isn’t it?</li>
<li>Supplemental:.
<ul>
<li>The first label that repeats an association has a relationship with the “immediately preceding label,” but is far removed from the root.</li>
<li>You can move much more freely away from the “structure” you have and assume beforehand.</li>
<li>Like a morning glory vine, it can move around and attach itself to another</li>

<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>It’s interesting that there are unexpected places where things come together and are connected (and conversely, things that I thought were related are not so related).
