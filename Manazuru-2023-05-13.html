<blockquote>
<p>The “Manazuru Town Development Ordinance” was enacted by the national government in 1993 and came into effect the following year. Article 10 of the ordinance, “Principles of Beauty (8 principles)” and “Standards of Beauty,” as well as rules for development and construction, the role of the council, and the participation of residents are stipulated as part of the town development plan. This was a pioneering example of a national ordinance regulating urban development, and it was also an unprecedented case in which “beauty” was stipulated in a statute. The design guidelines (design code) of the “Principles of Beauty” refer to the ideas in “A Vision of Britain’s Future: Reflections on Architecture” by Charles III, then Crown Prince of Wales, who was concerned that the once beautiful historical buildings of England were being demolished one after another. The “Ten Principles of Architecture” referred to in this book are considered as a hint for thinking, because they have a common universality for people living in cities, transcending country and time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1661, the Odawara clan planted 150,000 pine seedlings over a period of three years, and since then, in 1905, the forest was recognized as a forest that protects and nurtures fish and designated as a fish-guarding forest. The site had long been managed by the national government from the Goryozan (forest under the control of the feudal lord of the shogunate) to Goryozan (forest owned by the imperial family) until it was transferred to the town of Manazuru in 1952.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Manazuru Peninsula Nature Park was designated in 1954. Today, in order to preserve the forest in its present state for future generations, the following rules have been established: “Do not pick,” “Do not burn,” “Do not throw away,” and “Do not step into the forest.</p>
