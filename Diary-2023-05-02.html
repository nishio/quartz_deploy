<p>You say you’ve been busy and haven’t finished reviewing yesterday’s English yet, but you’re doing something unrelated.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Why it happens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is because the experience of “it takes longer than expected” has increased the estimated size of the task and raised the psychological hurdle for starting it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two 80-minute English conversation textbooks are produced every day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If we stop cutting back on sleep, we won’t have enough time to process this.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is just how I feel, not a fact.</li>
<li>In fact, the energy has leaked out as described above.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tasks should be reduced.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don’t simply reduce the quantity, but observe carefully and reduce unnecessary elements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>observation</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The transcription is immediately put on Scrapbox.</p>
<ul>
<li>That’s not necessary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s organized in such a way that it’s interesting for others to read it as a conversational text.</p>
<ul>
<li>That’s not necessary.</li>

<ul>
<li>What do you mean by “should review”?
<ul>
<li>It means something that might be used in a real-life situation.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Time wasted manually chopping and pasting into ChatGPT.</p>
<ul>
<li>I wrote a script to chop it up moderately and pass it to GPT4 to automate the process.</li>
<li>✅I have it in the console now, but I’ll make it spit it out to a file.</li>
<li>✅Manual retries on errors, but make that automatic as well.
<ul>
<li>✅Manipulation error on manual retry cut off the head of the second lesson, just redo that part.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Make sure to do that as soon as the Wisper process is finished.</li>
<li>There are two kind of transcription, one is the raw transcripton by Whisper, and the refined transcription by GPT4</li>
<li>Sometimes the refined transcripton has errors. In the case I have read the raw one and fixed the errors. However, I shouldn’t do that. The major reason of those errors is my pronunciation, and the instructor didn’t correct it. So those are not severe errors.</li>

<p>English learing memo</p>
<p>Hello, nice to meet you. I’ve read some of your works about X.
Let me introduce myself. My name is Hirokazu Nishio, call me Hiro.
I’m a researcher in a software company.
When I was in the doctoral cource, my major was visualization of high-dimensional data.
I’ve been interested in augumentation of human ability in these years.
I’ve read about the term ‘broad listening’ in your work.
I think the “broad listening” is a kind of human augumentation. It is interesting for me.</p>
<p>I’m from Osaka, but I have lived in Tokyo for 20 years.
I like playing games, but recently I don’t have enough time to play games because I have a lot of English lessons.</p>
<p>B: I have a lot of English lessons.
A: Why is that?
B: In the middle of this month, foreign person will visit us from around the world.</p>
<p>That’s really nice to hear.</p>
<p>I recently developed an automatic translation system for my personal wiki. I’ve written over 10,000 pages, which are being translated into English daily.</p>
<p>My company’s vision is “building a society brimming with teamwork.”
To make teamwork better, we need to understand how the team members feel. So the broad listening plays important role.</p>
<p>If you don’t mind, I’d like to tell you another topic.</p>
<p>No flesh-and-blood human being can hear a hundred people talking.</p>
<p>A: Does that make sense?</p>
<p>B: I’m not quite sure if I understand it correctly. Can you please explain?</p>
<p>With digital technology, we can do much more thing. For example, calculating large numbers rapidly and communicating with people oversea.</p>
<p>Computers can work around the clock without getting tired.</p>
<p>I recently made a system to transcribe our recordings of our conversations into text.
So you could probably sell that program and make a lot of money.</p>
<ul>
<li>I don’t want to do it because it’s a pain in the ass.</li>
<li>I don’t want to make it public because there are a lot of components and to describe how to use the system is a heavy task for me. To make a document for beginners is not interesting for me.</li>
</ul>
<p>B: The company of ChatGPT  offer an API for us, so we can use the API to call ChatGPT from our program.
A: Do they offer the API for free?
B: No, it’s not free. It costs, but it’s not too expensive. However, because it’s not free, if I offer the program for free, I have to pay a lot of money. So it’s not good for me. I need to implement a way to collect money from users. But I’m not interested in that. If I made it, I will make money, but it’s not interesting. Many people try to create such a system, so there will be high competition. I’m not interested in competing.</p>
<p>your system is very impressive.</p>

</ul>
<p>There’s a chance sales will rebound.
If sales rebound, we won’t lose our jobs.</p>
<p>A: Our ovens sell very well in the United States. They are high quality even at a low cost, and since they are so large, you can cook many things in them. We have brought them to Japan, but unfortunately, they are not selling well here. So, I’m wondering if you can help me figure out why.
B: Have you visited a Japanese house before?
A: No, we haven’t.
B: I think you should visit several model houses to see the actual size of Japanese houses. I believe your oven might be too big for Japanese kitchens. Japanese houses are generally small, and there might not be a place to put the oven in their kitchen.
A: Where do people put their ovens now?
B: Usually, they use a cabinet to put an electric oven, sometimes of a similar size. But from my experience, many people use all-in-one electric ovens with hot wind and water features.
A: Are they like toaster ovens?
B: Sorry, what does that means?
A: A toaster oven is for toasting bread and making small things. (showing a figure) This is a toaster oven.
B: It is a little smaller than I imagined. I’m thinking on an electric oven, like an electric range.
A: Ah, the stove top.
B: Stove top?
A: Yes, where you cook.
B: I think, cultural differences between Japan and the U.S. can cause differences in the words used to describe cooking tools, their meaning, size, and concept. It might be helpful to visit an electric store and see what’s common in Japan.
B: That’s a good idea.</p>
<p>I could review the 5/1 conversation and get to the point where I could chop it up and put it in Anki.
At this point it’s 0:36, so we need to be a little more efficient.
Anki while taking a bath and go to bed.</p>
