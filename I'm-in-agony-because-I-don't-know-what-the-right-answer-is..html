What specific question is “what is the right answer?” It is necessary to clarify what exactly is considered to be the “correct” answer.</p>

<p>What is “correct?”

- Suppose you have cards A, B, and C, and you think, “It feels right to stick A and B together and let go of C.” Then another person X says, “It would be better to stick B and C together and let go of A. Then another person X says, “It would be better to put B and C together and leave A apart.
- It is not that your placement was incorrect. It is just that you and Mr. X have different subjective views. Even if you are observing the same thing, you and Mr. X have different perspectives and see things differently.

<p>What constitutes a special resource depends on your environment and the problem you are solving. If you are trying to solve a problem that is close to you, you are most likely a useful source of information yourself. We tend to assume that the correct answer lies outside of ourselves. However, this is incorrect. Instead of exploring only outside of yourself, you need to look at yourself. You need to think of yourself as an important interviewee and carefully ask yourself what you subjectively think of yourself.</p>

For example, the price of a certain commodity goes up. This phenomenon and the phenomenon of a kite flying kite flying. Logically, there is no relationship between them. There is no objective logical connection at all.
In between, we can find subjective similarities, such as “Hey, is this similar? We can find a subjective similarity between the two. First of all, there is no relationship. But what if we were to subjectively find a relationship between the price of a product going up and an octopus flying a kite? As an example. Since this is subjective, there is no objective correct answer, so if I were to venture to find a relationship, I would think about what I could say.
This is subjectively thinking about what would be happening when the kite is going up if it were me.
When a kite flies, the wind blows. The force of the wind makes the kite fly. So what is the equivalent of wind here? When I wonder what it is that blows in the wind that contributes to the increase in the price of a product, I wonder if it is the attention of the customers. If you imagine a wind blowing and a kite flying, what other things can happen at that time? What other things happen before or after the wind blows?
For example, this is really subjective, so there is no correct answer. You may be wondering what the correct answer should be. I think this analogy is subjective, so let’s say it is a memory from when I was a child, and the wind was so strong that the string of my kite broke and it flew away. It was too windy. It was too windy.
Then, what does the phenomenon of a kite flying away because the wind is too strong in kite-flying kites mean when we bring it back to our world? What does it mean in terms of products when the attention of the customers is so strong that the price of the product…tears off and flies away?</p>

If we make it a two-way question, “Will it go up or will it not?” then logically, one is right and one is wrong, so we assume that it is important to choose the right one.
In real-world questions, however, often “it doesn’t make much difference which is the right answer”. In this case, there is no utility in knowing which is the correct answer.</p>

<p>What do you associate with the term “how to learn”? A scene with a teacher and students? A process where you have a book of problems, solve them by yourself, and check your answers? In college classes, there is sometimes an exercise called group work. This is an exercise in which students form groups of several people and discuss and create answers to problems among themselves. It is much different from solving a set of problems alone. Also, research is the process of finding an answer that no one else in the world knows yet. It is very different from a problem collection that already has the “right answer”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In middle and high school, the problems to be solved and the correct answers have already been determined. In the real world, on the other hand, the problems and correct answers are not yet known. How can we learn in this situation?</p>
