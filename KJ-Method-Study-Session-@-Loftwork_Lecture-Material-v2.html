<ul>
<li>This time, the role of <img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/> in that kind of background: promoting multifaceted understanding by offering different perspectives.</li>
<li>A picture of multifaceted understanding:.

<li>One person says it’s a circle, another says it’s a square.
<ul>
<li>Seemingly contradictory opinions, which is right?</li>
<li>Neither is correct!

</li>
<li>The KJ method has a catchphrase ”[* Let the data do the talking
<ul>
<li>The basic premise about this “data”</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/川喜田二郎/icon" alt="川喜田二郎.icon" height="19.5"/>「 <a href="./All-data-is-a-lie" class="internal alias" data-slug="All-data-is-a-lie">All data is a lie</a> 」</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>(skip) <a href="./All-data-is-a-lie" class="internal alias" data-slug="All-data-is-a-lie">All data is a lie</a>. Use data knowing it to be a lie. And from there, we can determine the more correct truth. That is the path to judgment. But how can we determine the truth from a lie? It is because, from a different point of view, every piece of data also contains some semblance of the truth.

</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Some of you may think “data” is “objective and correct,” but what <img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/Jiro Kawakita/icon" alt="Jiro Kawakita.icon" height="19.5"/> reads as “data” is not “correct.
<ul>
<li>Observe and record a wide variety of things
<ul>
<li>This recorded material is called “data.”</li>
<li>Most of the data is unquantifiable</li>
<li>Data also includes “Mr. A said it was a circle” and “Mr. B said it was a square.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A. “Mr. A said it was a circle” is a description of the view from Mr. A’s point of view.
<ul>
<li>Errors inevitably enter the process of that description.</li>
<li>It’s a circle! It’s a square!
<ul>
<li>Actually the same thing described from different angles.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>So <img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/Jiro Kawakita/icon" alt="Jiro Kawakita.icon" height="19.5"/> “<a href="./From-a-360-degree-viewing-angle" class="internal alias" data-slug="From-a-360-degree-viewing-angle">From a 360-degree viewing angle</a>” It is important to collect data.

<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/川喜田二郎/icon" alt="川喜田二郎.icon" height="19.5"/>Let the data speak for itself.”
<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>Words are hard…”
<ul>
<li>It’s an old saying.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Contemporary translation: “Let the data do the talking.”
<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>Data doesn’t talk, does it?”
<ul>
<li>Figurative expression.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Consider “Let Friend A Talk.”
<ul>
<li>Mr. A: “Hey, listen to me!”</li>
<li>Bad example (Mr. B)
<ul>
<li>Listen to me for a moment.
<ul>
<li>Mr. B: “Yes, yes, in short, you want to say ~.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you said this, Mr. A wouldn’t be able to speak the rest of the story.</li>
<li>Mr. B is “someone who doesn’t listen.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Good example (Mr. C)
<ul>
<li>Mr. A. “This is a circle!”</li>
<li>Mr. C. “I see, so this is a circle.”</li>
<li>Mr. C is taking what Mr. A said to heart.
<ul>
<li>Mr. C is “someone who can listen.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mr. C doesn’t have to believe that “this is a circle” is true.
<ul>
<li>It’s OK if you take it as, “Mr. A feels, ‘This is a circle.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Good attitude towards people:.
<ul>
<li>“Listen to what they have to say without assuming, ‘This is what they must be trying to say.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The equivalent attitude toward the data is: “I’m not a good person.
<ul>
<li>“Don’t just assume, ‘This must be happening,’ but look at the data.”</li>
<li>This is “letting the data do the talking.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Let the Data Do the Talking” in the planning stages of this study session.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Issues that were initially verbalized</p>
<ul>
<li>It is difficult to pass on the skills to younger members.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nishio’s first thought.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you want to transfer tacit knowledge, why not “transfer it non-verbally by doing it in the same place” (<a href="./collaboration" class="internal" data-slug="collaboration">collaboration</a>)?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>I saw detailed data.</p>
<ul>
<li>We look at the results of preliminary surveys and conduct small-scale experiments.</li>
<li>In many cases, especially younger members are doing the KJ method with their teams.
<ul>
<li>In other words, we are already doing the “non-verbal communication by doing it in the same place” and then the current issues arise.</li>
<li>This is the big realization this time around</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I don’t know what it means,” “I don’t know the right answer,” “I feel like it’s too late to ask,” “I’m scared,” and “I can’t do it alone” in the data were seen as relevant.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>hypothesis</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>The KJ method is an essential skill, I was told to read the assigned book “Ideas” and I did, but I don’t understand what it means…</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>I’m doing the KJ method with my seniors. I’m trying to do it like that, but I’m not sure if this is the right way… I don’t know the right answer…</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>When I say, “I don’t really understand,” you say, “What? Now?” I’m afraid you might say, “What? Afraid to ask questions…</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>I can’t do it alone because I don’t know the right answer…</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>My hypothesis: “It’s important to solve this problem.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="./Parable-of-the-Bicycle" class="internal alias" data-slug="Parable-of-the-Bicycle">Parable of the Bicycle</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most of you can ride a bicycle, right?</p>
<ul>
<li>Now let’s say here’s a person who doesn’t know how to ride a bicycle.</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>“I can’t ride a bicycle because I don’t know how to ride a bicycle properly, please tell me!”</li>
<li>What do we do now?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In fact, I did a “let’s try it alone” experiment and got some “I can’t do it because I don’t know the right answer” type of feedback.</p>
<ul>
<li>Implicitly, you’re assuming that those who have done it know the right answer.</li>
<li>They assume, “I don’t know the right answer, I can’t do it without being taught.”</li>
<li>But your process of learning how to ride a bike, was that a classroom lecture where you were taught the right way?</li>
<li>You should have actually straddled the bike in a safe park or something, tried many times, sometimes fell down, and from the repetition you should have learned the knack of moving forward in a stable manner.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="./Self-improvement-is-not-bad,-in-fact,-it-is-good" class="internal alias" data-slug="Self-improvement-is-not-bad,-in-fact,-it-is-good">Self-improvement is not bad, in fact, it is good</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another perspective: a line from a veteran who has done the KJ method over 100 times.</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>I may have taken the liberty of making some of it my own.”
<ul>
<li>This veteran doesn’t think he’s doing things the right way.</li>
<li>Nor do I think, “I know the right answer, but I’m changing it a bit and making it my own.”</li>
<li>He thinks, “I don’t know the right answer.”</li>
<li>So I don’t know if the way I’m doing it is the right way or my own way.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>There is no right answer, everyone who knows how to use it is self-taught.</p>
<ul>
<li>Just like how you all ride your bicycles in your own way.
<ul>
<li>They know that riding a bike will get them around faster than walking.</li>
<li>Ride when you need it.</li>
<li>This is enough for practical purposes.</li>
<li>It doesn’t have to be “the right way to ride.” It can be your own way.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The reason you don’t get a clear answer to your question about the “right way” is because everyone is doing it their own way.</li>
<li>Self-improvement is not bad, in fact, it’s good.
<ul>
<li>my own way = customized way to fit my personality = use
<ul>
<li>[Each person is unique, so it is only natural that the method that works best for that person will be different for each person.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can refine your own “my style” through trial and error.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>KJ method is also my own method to begin with.
<ul>
<li>The intellectual production technique created by Jiro Kawakita was given the name “KJ method” after the fact.</li>
<li>A third party said, “It’s Jiro Kawakita’s way, so it’s the KJ method,” and it took root.</li>
<li>In other words, the KJ method is just “Jiro Kawakita’s own method of intellectual production.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think you’re all in this study group because you want to “learn the KJ method.”</p>
<ul>
<li>The goal is not to “know the correct KJ method.”</li>
<li>The objective is “to be able to produce intellectual production better by creating my own intellectual production techniques using the KJ method as a reference.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully a loftwork style will emerge.</p>
<ul>
<li>Not only should each individual refine his or her own style, but it would also be good if ideas of our own style circulate within your company, stimulating each other.
<ul>
<li>I hope the result will be something like “Loftwork style”.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>for some reason</li>
<li>Summary of fieldwork being done by a cultural anthropologist in 1967.</li>
<li>The day-to-day work your company is doing in 2022</li>
<li>There is a huge gap between the two.
<ul>
<li>Different objectives, different tools used.
<ul>
<li>There’s lots of talk about paper diaries and labels in “Ideas,” but no mention of computers or smartphones, because it’s a book from 1967.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trying to apply the 1967 “Ideas Act” to day-to-day operations.
<ul>
<li>Throw out detailed specific methods,</li>
<li>Extracting the essence as an intellectual production technique,</li>
<li>It is necessary to achieve this using modern tools</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Isn’t it too hard to just give a new employee a book and have them do it?</li>

<p>History of KJ method updates
- [The term “KJ method” is vague.
- <img src="https://gyazo.com/9a8007a7ee850e24d1e2113fb74856a0/thumb/1000" alt="image"/>
- 1: 1964 “Party Science” 1967 “Ideas” introduced <img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/Jiro Kawakita/icon" alt="Jiro Kawakita.icon" height="19.5"/>‘s intellectual production techniques.
- It was called the “KJ method” after the fact.
- The method objective was to “summarize” the large amount of qualitative data gathered after fieldwork to find out what <img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/Jiro Kawakita/icon" alt="Jiro Kawakita.icon" height="19.5"/> wanted to know.
- 2: The KJ method became a hot topic, and <img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/Jiro Kawakita/icon" alt="Jiro Kawakita.icon" height="19.5"/> began to teach it to others, and in the process, “KJ method can be applied to various purposes.
- And it was applied to a wide variety of purposes by <img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/Jiro Kawakita/icon" alt="Jiro Kawakita.icon" height="19.5"/> himself and those around him
- Because the objectives are different, the methods are also slightly different.
- The concept of the KJ method has expanded to a blur.
- <img src="https://gyazo.com/f1b29f9e8cf2aefb6f68b3f3805f11bf/thumb/1000" alt="image"/>
- <img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/川喜田二郎/icon" alt="川喜田二郎.icon" height="19.5"/>began using the term “<a href="./KJ-method-in-the-narrow-sense" class="internal alias" data-slug="KJ-method-in-the-narrow-sense">KJ method in the narrow sense</a>” to refer to the original method in order to distinguish between the original KJ method and these blurry and varied KJ legal methods.
- However, since there are several narrowly defined KJ methods, <img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/> decided to call it “<a href="./Beginning-KJ-method" class="internal alias" data-slug="Beginning-KJ-method">Beginning KJ method</a>”.
- 3: One of the many and varied applications of the KJ method
- We’ll call it the “KJ Legal Workshop.”
- <img src="https://gyazo.com/bb9caf5ba9dfdf8337ea2a94969d3b94/thumb/1000" alt="image"/>
- A workshop that brings together a large group of “people who have never studied the KJ method”, writes down their ideas on sticky notes, and then wearily discusses them as everyone puts them together in groups.
- The nature of the KJ method, which is “done for a large number of people who have never studied KJ before,” made this the “first experience with KJ” for many people.
- As a result, a lot of people recognized that “this is the KJ method.”
- Another “narrow meaning of KJ method” has been created.
- This “KJ legal workshop” is at odds with <img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/Jiro Kawakita/icon" alt="Jiro Kawakita.icon" height="19.5"/>‘s “Beginning KJ method” approach in many ways
- <img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/川喜田二郎/icon" alt="川喜田二郎.icon" height="19.5"/> <a href="./The-KJ-method-is-not-powerful-without-individual-work." class="internal alias" data-slug="The-KJ-method-is-not-powerful-without-individual-work.">The KJ method is not powerful without individual work.</a>
- <img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/川喜田二郎/icon" alt="川喜田二郎.icon" height="19.5"/> <a href="./50-KJ-method-assumes-10-hours" class="internal alias" data-slug="50-KJ-method-assumes-10-hours">50 KJ method assumes 10 hours</a>
- So people who recognize this “KJ legal workshop” as “KJ method” will be confused when they read <img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/Jiro Kawakita/icon" alt="Jiro Kawakita.icon" height="19.5"/>‘s book
- Because there are things written here and there that are at variance with “my experience with the KJ method”.
- KJ method” is a fuzzy, low-resolution language, so it is necessary to improve the resolution of the language.</p>

<ul>
<li>I get so many questions about “not knowing how to organize groups.”
<ul>
<li>But in the first place, the “practical” KJ method proposed by <img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/Jiro Kawakita/icon" alt="Jiro Kawakita.icon" height="19.5"/> in the later period does not organize groups</li>
<li>Need for grouping” is an assumption contrary to the data.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/川喜田二郎/icon" alt="川喜田二郎.icon" height="19.5"/>He himself doesn’t organize the group in 90% of the cases.

<li>
<blockquote>
<p>(skip)<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/Jiro Kawakita/icon" alt="Jiro Kawakita.icon" height="19.5"/>The first system in which the KJ method was introduced to the world was the six-round cumulative KJ method. This created the perception that problem solving by the KJ method was time-consuming. (p.436)</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>People who read only the “Idea Method” of 1967 mistakenly believe that the six-round cumulative KJ method proposed by <img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/Jiro Kawakita/icon" alt="Jiro Kawakita.icon" height="19.5"/> in the early days is the main method.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>However, <img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/Jiro Kawakita/icon" alt="Jiro Kawakita.icon" height="19.5"/> himself has only done the six-round cumulative KJ method eight times in the five years since 1981 (p.436).
<ul>
<li>I have made about 1000 pieces, 8 of them, less than 1%.</li>
<li><img src="https://gyazo.com/2bf75f74885b4c9e5ecfb8a633a3ddae/thumb/1000" alt="image"/></li>
<li>I only do it once or twice a year.
<ul>
<li>We only do this for major themes that take six months to a year to conclude.</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>In the example of “Writing a book”, the theme is like “Writing a book”.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I do one or two rounds of light KJ method about once every two weeks.</li>
<li>I make about one exploration net (thinking fireworks) every two or three days.
<ul>
<li>Accounts for about 90% of all cases.</li>
<li>In other words, <img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/Jiro Kawakita/icon" alt="Jiro Kawakita.icon" height="19.5"/> is not grouping in 90% of the cases.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When is grouping necessary?</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/川喜田二郎/icon" alt="川喜田二郎.icon" height="19.5"/>is not grouped in 90% of cases.
<ul>
<li>→ Group formation in 10% of cases.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>So at what point do we need to form groups?
<ul>
<li>Quite simply, “when there are too many sheets.”<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/></li>
<li>If there are too many sheets, space placement is suddenly impossible.</li>
<li>therefore
<ul>
<li>Look at the whole picture and “attach what seems relevant.”</li>
<li>Give the group a “nameplate” that represents its content.</li>
<li>Bundle bundle with the nameplate at the top.</li>
<li><img src="https://gyazo.com/23cbfbf14fc93c8cecb5eac7dac0cd3d/thumb/1000" alt="image"/></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bundling reduces the apparent number of sheets.
<ul>
<li>This is the purpose of group formation<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Many people have trouble organizing groups.</p>
<ul>
<li>I get a lot of questions.</li>
<li>I think the term “grouping” is misleading.<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>
<ul>
<li>The term “group formation” tends to make people feel like they have to form groups</li>
<li>The word “group” tends to conjure up images of “a collection of many labels.”</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>Some things just don’t fit anywhere.”
<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Then leave it in one piece.</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/川喜田二郎/icon" alt="川喜田二郎.icon" height="19.5"/>There remain many labels that say, “I can’t find a mate, and I’m left with one” (p. 126).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>How many pieces are in a group?”
<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>A lot of people are confused because they’re suddenly trying to create a group with a large number of pieces.
<ul>
<li>First of all, you should think of it as “sticking two pieces together.”</li>
<li>It’s not uncommon for something attached in two pieces to later become attached and increase in number of pieces, “Oh, this is one of them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/川喜田二郎/icon" alt="川喜田二郎.icon" height="19.5"/>Some sets of labels <a href="./are" class="internal" data-slug="are">are</a> a set of two labels, others a set of three labels, and <a href="./some" class="internal" data-slug="some">some</a> a set of four or five labels” (p. 126). Some are a set of four or five labels” (p. 126).</li>
<li>The number of sheets is not a guide in advance, but is determined by the data.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the “exploration net” proposed by <img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/Jiro Kawakita/icon" alt="Jiro Kawakita.icon" height="19.5"/> in the late mid-term, we first do “draw a line between two pieces”.
<ul>
<li>This is the equivalent of <img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>‘s “First attach the two pieces”.</li>

<p>About this work</p>
<ul>
<li>This work is like “practice riding a bike”.
<ul>
<li>The goal is to drive long distances on public roads in the future, but we won’t challenge that from the start.</li>
<li>Practice running short distances in a safe park first.
<ul>
<li>If you fall, you won’t get hit by a car, and if you miss, you won’t get seriously hurt.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This work is not a job with customers or deadlines, no need to think about responsibility for deliverables.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The goal is to experience “the sensation of pedaling a bicycle forward.
<ul>
<li>To “move forward” is to “realize something you didn’t realize before.”</li>
<li>Pedaling a bicycle with the stand up does not move it forward.
<ul>
<li>It looks like “riding a bike” but it’s not.</li>
<li>No amount of that is going to make me learn to ride a bike.</li>
<li>Actually, it’s not just the pedals steering wheel operation is important (see below).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ride your bike as often as you can!
<ul>
<li>Eventually you get used to it and realize, “I can go faster this way than I can walk.”</li>
<li>This realization gives us confidence that we can do it this way.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For those who can already ride a bicycle
<ul>
<li>The key issue that needs to be solved is that “the skills of veterans are not being passed on to the younger generation” which was the impetus for holding this study session.</li>
<li>Seeing people fall down because they can’t do it right gives you a chance to look at what you’re “doing somehow” and verbalize it.</li>
<li>Your personal skills are more easily improved when the process can be verbalized.</li>
<li>Opportunity to focus on process improvement, not deliverables, because this time, unlike when we do the work, we are not “accountable for deliverables”.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This time the work is specifically
<ul>
<li>1: one person.</li>
<li>2: about 25 sheets.</li>

<p>People who have only experienced group KJ from the beginning have a hard time developing the basic ability to do individual work… Moreover, because they have only done it in groups many times, they feel like they have somehow mastered the KJ method.

Otherwise, undesirable compromises will occur and it will not work”.
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Around 1968, a training program began in which two people work in pairs to assemble labels. However, this work was conducted only in the third round (pursuit of essence), after the participants had experienced the first and second rounds of labeling work on the same theme, one after the other on an individual basis. It was only in this third round that the participants succeeded in working in flexible pairs for the first time. Prior to this, I judged that the individual competence of each person was not mature enough. It seemed to me that operationally speaking, an undesirable compromise would occur between the two of us.

<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/川喜田二郎/icon" alt="川喜田二郎.icon" height="19.5"/> <a href="./It-takes-more-than-100-sheets-to-really-understand-the-KJ-method." class="internal alias" data-slug="It-takes-more-than-100-sheets-to-really-understand-the-KJ-method.">It takes more than 100 sheets to really understand the KJ method.</a>
<ul>
<li>I totally agree, so in “The Intellectual Production of Engineers,” I wrote something to the effect that if you can’t make 100 labels, you’re not gathering enough information in the first place.<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>But as I was planning this study group [Maybe 25 sheets would be a good first step to experience the KJ method.
<ul>
<li>The data shows that many people are stumped by the lack of “experience in going it alone to the end.
<ul>
<li>So it’s important to do it alone first to finish <a href="./the-experience-of-accomplishing-a-task" class="internal alias" data-slug="the-experience-of-accomplishing-a-task">the experience of accomplishing a task</a>.</li>
<li><a href="./The-KJ-method-is-four-times-more-difficult-when-the-number-of-sheets-doubles." class="internal alias" data-slug="The-KJ-method-is-four-times-more-difficult-when-the-number-of-sheets-doubles.">The KJ method is four times more difficult when the number of sheets doubles.</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You should <a href="./Close-to-the-goal" class="internal alias" data-slug="Close-to-the-goal">Close to the goal</a> make the task smaller.
<ul>
<li>It’s not right for someone who is just starting to jog to participate in a full marathon.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Jiro Kawakita’s “KJ method” in “It takes more than 100 sheets to understand the KJ method” refers to “<a href="./Beginning-KJ-method" class="internal alias" data-slug="Beginning-KJ-method">Beginning KJ method</a>”.
<ul>
<li>Late in the process <img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/Jiro Kawakita/icon" alt="Jiro Kawakita.icon" height="19.5"/> says “[30-60 labels for fireworks to think about.”
<ul>
<li>in other words</li>
<li>The idea that 100 sheets are not necessary for daily practical use.</li>
<li>(However, we believe that the KJ method of beginnings must also be mastered.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I recommend repeating a small number of sheets first, and after you get used to it, try to exceed 100 sheets.<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>
<ul>
<li>Doing the KJ method with over 100 sheets makes you keenly aware of the benefits of “grouping, bundling, and reducing the apparent number of sheets”.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>3: Do it with a label of your own origin</p>
<ul>
<li>For more information:.<a href="./KJ-method-from-surveys-is-the-most-difficult." class="internal alias" data-slug="KJ-method-from-surveys-is-the-most-difficult.">KJ method from surveys is the most difficult.</a> <img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/></li>
<li>What do you do when you see a label and say, “I’d like more information.
<ul>
<li>1: Label with your thoughts
<ul>
<li>→Then ask yourself, “How can I elaborate on this?” Ask yourself</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2: Labels created from multi-person brainstorming sessions, etc.
<ul>
<li>→Then ask the person who offered that opinion, “How would you elaborate on this?” ask the person who gave the opinion, “What do you mean when you say this in more detail?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>3: Labels created by picking up from “long descriptions” such as books
<ul>
<li>→Reread the relevant sections of the book.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>4: Labels created from “short descriptions” such as free-text sections of anonymous surveys.
<ul>
<li>→I’m in trouble.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It is easiest and quickest to do it with a label of your own origin.
<ul>
<li>So this time I’ll do it with a label of my own origin.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>4: Explore the Net</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/川喜田二郎/icon" alt="川喜田二郎.icon" height="19.5"/>is based on an exploratory net that I read as a “practical application of the KJ method”.
<ul>
<li>The “Beginning KJ Method” is too heavy for you to use in your daily work.</li>
<li>Better to use a lightweight one over and over to get used to it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This time, we will use “<a href="./Fireworks-to-think-about" class="internal alias" data-slug="Fireworks-to-think-about">Fireworks to think about</a>” as a base among several variations of “Explore Net”.
<ul>
<li>Terms like “<a href="./Expedition-Net" class="internal alias" data-slug="Expedition-Net">Expedition Net</a>”, “fireworks”, and “thinking fireworks” are not so neatly organized by <img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/Jiro Kawakita/icon" alt="Jiro Kawakita.icon" height="19.5"/> himself.
<ul>
<li>So the name doesn’t mean much if you think about it too much (read <a href="./The-flow-of-birth-of-fireworks-to-think-about" class="internal alias" data-slug="The-flow-of-birth-of-fireworks-to-think-about">The flow of birth of fireworks to think about</a> if you want to know more).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Not as the original “Thinking Fireworks” but customized to the constraints of this study group.
<ul>
<li>The original method has no time limits or group discussions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The original “Thinking Fireworks” will surely be useful for your work, so if you are interested, please read the explanations on p.304-311 of <a href="./KJ-method-Let-the-chaos-speak-for-itself" class="internal alias" data-slug="KJ-method-Let-the-chaos-speak-for-itself">KJ method Let the chaos speak for itself</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>5: Getting noticed</p>
<ul>
<li>The purpose of this project was to [* notice things I had not noticed before
<ul>
<li>This is what is called an “idea” or “finding a solution to a problem”.</li>
<li>If you notice any one thing that is new to you, you’ve succeeded.</li>
<li>Some would find this difficult.
<ul>
<li>That’s like someone who can’t ride a bike thinking it’s too difficult to go on a bike.</li>
<li>From someone who can ride a bike, I feel like “that’s why I ride”.<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/></li>
<li>Confidence grows after a few “got it” experiences.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I should clearly note that the following is not the purpose of this project
<ul>
<li>It’s not about “connecting all the pre-prepared labels.”</li>
<li>It’s not about “putting the data together nicely.”</li>
<li>Nor is it “making pretty diagrams.”</li>
<li>Nor is it “slurred speech.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[* To become aware of things I had not been aware of before</li>
</ul>
<p>procedure</p>
<ul>
<li>The procedure is intended to be read by each individual on his/her own during individual work</li>
<li>Read only the beginning of the lecture.</li>
</ul>
<p>Step 1: Place the theme in the middle
- After this, expand the associations in 360 degree directions.
- Repeat the process of placing labels around the labels and connecting them with a line.</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic Procedure
<ul>
<li>First, write the theme with one large label in the middle.</li>
<li>Add new labels for things you associate with this theme and connect them with a line
<ul>
<li>Add a new label for the one you associate with that label, and repeat.
<ul>
<li>If you have experience with <a href="./mind-map" class="internal" data-slug="mind-map">mind-map</a>, it may be easier to imagine writing associations and connecting them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mind maps create a tree structure, but exploration nets create a mesh (see below).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This time I had the labels pre-written.
<ul>
<li>When you write out a list under time pressure, you tend to be in a hurry and make messy labels.
<ul>
<li>That can make all the later phases goofy. I wanted to avoid that.
<ul>
<li>(see  <a href="./Don't-put-time-pressure-on-label-creation." class="internal alias" data-slug="Don't-put-time-pressure-on-label-creation.">Don’t put time pressure on label creation.</a> )</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When expanding the associations from the theme, glance at the existing labels and pick up and connect any labels that seem to be connected.</li>
<li>Create a new label when you come up with something that is not on the label you have prepared.</li>
<li>The goal is not to “hook up everything we’ve prepared in advance.”
<ul>
<li>If you can use it, you can use it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Step 2: Create a net-like structure (net) instead of a tree
- Place labels where they will be surrounded and where many lines will be drawn.
- turn out like this
- <img src="https://gyazo.com/6dca2378f76b52d352b8c985e17034f9/thumb/1000" alt="image"/></p>
<ul>
<li>In the exploratory net, the first step is to express the relationship between the two pieces in lines, without grouping them together.
<ul>
<li>Many people have trouble organizing groups for the KJ method, but you can get the hang of it by doing an exploratory net.</li>
<li>Instead of “grouping,” “categorizing,” “categorizing,” or “creating an axis,” attach two pieces that seem related.</li>
<li>also place opposing labels close together.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Place the label in a place where it will draw lots of lines with its surroundings.
<ul>
<li>Lines should be as short as possible.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This process creates this kind of mesh (net).
<ul>
<li>
<p><img src="https://gyazo.com/6dca2378f76b52d352b8c985e17034f9/thumb/1000" alt="image"/></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I actually made it on the Miro board you all are looking at.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the time the mesh was created, it was not divided into groups.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the process of creating a mesh, for example, you may say, “I thought I was thinking in terms of multiple aspects, but when I put them together, there are gaps around the themes.
<ul>
<li>What fills this gap?” Prompting awareness by asking “What fills this gap?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Step 3: When the net is completed, enclose two or three pieces at a time with a pen and attach a nameplate.
- For example, like this red pen.
- <img src="https://gyazo.com/611f2c8c7e7385ef767acb475e9b8727/thumb/1000" alt="image"/>
- Repeat this “2-3 enclosures and a nameplate” until there are 5-6 enclosures.
- <img src="https://gyazo.com/9edf5e93aa5470da3e2158f7abc2a362/thumb/1000" alt="image"/></p>
<ul>
<li>Surround the area with two to three pieces, four to five at most.
<ul>
<li>Anything that does not fit well anywhere may be left in one piece (lone wolf).</li>
<li>(In Miro) I thought it would be good to use a frame, but it was hard to do, so I decided to enclose it with a pen.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Once enclosed, summarize and give a title (nameplate)
<ul>
<li>How would you summarize it?” Asking the question “How can I summarize this?</li>
<li>Unlike the narrowly defined KJ method, there is no bundling, so there is no restriction that “the meaning must be known only by the nameplate” (SEE <a href="./Mission-of-the-nameplate" class="internal alias" data-slug="Mission-of-the-nameplate">Mission of the nameplate</a>).
<ul>
<li>Even if you make some mistakes, you can summarize them comfortably because you know what they mean when you read what’s in them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Repeat this “enclose two or three pieces and put a nameplate” until there are five or six enclosures.</li>
</ul>
<p>Step 4: Focus on what you notice and share it with others.
- First, take a break and take a good look at the whole thing.
- Then focus on “what you noticed” and put it into words to communicate to others.</p>
<ul>
<li>When the work is done, first take a break and carefully appreciate the whole process.
<ul>
<li>You can add anything you come up with in the process.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Then, make it descriptive.
<ul>
<li>No need to write long, clean sentences.</li>
<li>That’s not what we’re here for.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Repost: The purpose of this time is “to notice something new for me, even if it is just one thing.”
<ul>
<li>So pay attention to “what you notice” and put it into words.</li>
<li>Narrativization also has different ways of doing things depending on the purpose. by<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/川喜田二郎/icon" alt="川喜田二郎.icon" height="19.5"/>
<ul>
<li>Narrative for reporting of facts collected
<ul>
<li>Many of you may be used to this, but that is not the purpose of this project.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/川喜田二郎/icon" alt="川喜田二郎.icon" height="19.5"/>Narrating for Ideas” (p. 141)
<ul>
<li>Put more and more of what you notice and ideas that come to mind into writing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It is not important to report the whole picture of the ex-labels in this study session
<ul>
<li>So, “awareness” is the main focus of the story.</li>
<li>Just mention the minimum necessary labels that relate to what you want to talk about.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why is awareness valuable?
<ul>
<li>Because that’s what “the bike moves forward.”</li>
<li>Repeating the same things we’ve been doing won’t solve the problem.</li>
<li>Reaffirming what you already know hasn’t taught you anything.</li>
<li>In order to move forward, it is necessary to notice “what we have not noticed before”.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some are fast, some are slow.</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s not necessarily the slow people who are to blame, it’s the “fast people” who are quick to put on an appearance without much thought that’s the problem.
<ul>
<li>It’s like buzzing around on the pedals with the bike stand up.</li>
<li>It’s just that there’s no load on it, so it can spin faster.</li>
<li>Doing that doesn’t move you forward, it doesn’t give you new insights.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This time, the rule is “If a label does not reticulate in the first 30 minutes, leave it alone and move on”.
<ul>
<li>The idea of adjusting time by reducing the number of sheets for slow people</li>
<li>If you spend too much time trying to “use it all,” you’ll run out of time later in the day.
<ul>
<li>The summarize part of the second half is important.</li>
<li>It is much better to limit the number of sheets than to do the second half in a hurry and in a mess.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>That’s why I made this rule.</li>
<li>If you don’t have time constraints, you’re really better off challenging yourself to use all the labels.
<ul>
<li>From <a href="./Questioning-promotes-awareness." class="internal alias" data-slug="Questioning-promotes-awareness.">Questioning promotes awareness.</a> “How can this be connected?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>People with extra time
<ul>
<li>You should take the time to watch it and add as much as you can think of.
<ul>
<li>This is how <img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/Jiro Kawakita/icon" alt="Jiro Kawakita.icon" height="19.5"/> also recommends</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can go and watch other people work.</li>
<li>Veterans may, for example, consider what is between the following questions and their own net (<a href="./Questions-encourage-verbalization." class="internal alias" data-slug="Questions-encourage-verbalization.">Questions encourage verbalization.</a>)
<ul>
<li>Q: How can I improve my skills?</li>
<li>Q: How can we enhance the skills of the members around us?</li>
<li>Q: What can we do to update Jiro Kawakita’s KJ method to fit the context of your company today?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Supplementation of future individual work</p>
<ul>
<li>I want you to know that we were not able to do this time due to the constraints of the study group.</li>
<li>In fact, it is better to make the theme about what you are struggling with at the moment
<ul>
<li>Because you really want there to be <a href="./awareness" class="internal" data-slug="awareness">awareness</a> about it, because you really want to
<ul>
<li>You should write what you are really struggling with and thinking about, not just some random label you made up to practice the KJ method.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>But you don’t want to share your thoughts on the subject with others.
<ul>
<li>For example, if you are serious about your career, “changing jobs” is an option you should consider.</li>
<li>But you don’t want to discuss the benefits of changing jobs in front of your colleagues and seniors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In this work, the benefit of “seeing other people’s work” was a priority.
<ul>
<li>In truth, it’s better to do it alone, in secret.</li>
<li>There is no need to show others the illustrations and narratives that were created.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ideally, there should be no time limit.
<ul>
<li>It is beneficial to think carefully until you are satisfied</li>
<li>The purpose is to think hard and gain new insights.</li>
<li>When you have a presentation scheduled in a certain amount of time, it’s easy to get impatient and try to look presentable in the eyes of others</li>
<li>In this work, we prioritized the benefits of “listening to other people’s insights”.
<ul>
<li>That’s why I ended up with a certain amount of time and then made time to share it with others.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After this study session is over, I want you to take your time and do it alone, without any time limit, on a topic you really want to think about, without worrying about what others think.
<ul>
<li>This experience is very important for “KJ legal thinking to become clear”.<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/></li>
