- I think the endgame of this one is probably that after the mode transitions to asking about relationships between symbols because it has a lot of keywords and considers them developed enough, it runs out of high scoring words, but it’s still in the asking about relationships mode.
- Perhaps judging it from the distribution of keyword scores,
- I propose an end.
- Propose a new chat.
- Return to search mode
- I think it would be appropriate to do one of the following

- The amount of features should be improved.

- Do not repeat symmetrical questions: done

- NG feedback is used as training data
- → Not enough data and poor quality as training data.

<li>
<p>In response to the input “Tsu, Tsuyoshi”.</p>
<ul>
<li>Not selected as a keyword because “strong” is an adjective.
<ul>
<li>“What kind of “tough” is that “tough”?” is an ant question, so you might want to extract it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The “つ” can be a noun, so it is included in the keywords.</li>
<li>The result is that you end up asking “one” digging question.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Play keywords that are not good.</p>
<ul>
<li>The CUI version had.</li>
<li>Turn it off when you make the Mattermost version and keep it off.</li>
<li>Use NGKW feedback to learn!</li>
<li>→There are quite a few cases where users are unaware of NGKW even though it’s a good keyword, and learning from users makes you a fool.
<ul>
<li>I put it in the form of putting only the obvious no-no’s on the list.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What we want to feedback</p>
<ul>
<li>Keyword extraction is not the first step.
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>You’re starting to buy into the subtlety of it.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Where is that w?</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>NGKW command.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>NG keywords selected for input
<ul>
<li>Example: The
- <a href="./midday-sun" class="internal alias" data-slug="midday-sun">midday sun</a></li>
<li>Keyword extraction is fine, but not in the direction the user wants to drill down
<ul>
<li>I hope you can say, “No, not that way,” because this might not be something you can learn about in advance.</li>
<li>It was realized in the form of the NGKW and UPKW commands.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Not a good combination of keywords and questions chosen.
<ul>
<li>NG feedback is used as training data</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="./Identical-symbol-relationship" class="internal alias" data-slug="Identical-symbol-relationship">Identical symbol relationship</a></li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>If the answer is that the relationship between two symbols is identical, it’s not a good idea to ask questions about the relationship between symbols.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Wouldn’t it be nice if a button appeared that said “same” and when you pressed it, the two keywords were merged as a command?
<ul>
<li>I’ll test it properly, because I’m afraid that the disappearance of one of the keywords might cause some bug.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Described by a relatively small number of parameters
<ul>
<li>I want to make the BETTER indicators as good as possible while adhering to the MUST constraints.</li>
<li>parameter search</li>
<li>The large number of variations in the choice of questions (all of which must appear at least once) is also a constraint.</li>

<li>
<p>Include attenuation in cumulative score calculation?</p>
<ul>
<li>Wouldn’t it be better to add attenuation? I’ve wondered about that.</li>
<li>On the other hand, I’m also inclined to think that if you’re responding well to the first “what do you hope will happen in this dialogue”, you might want to remind yourself of the key words there from time to time.
<ul>
<li>Often we observe cases where the first answer on this is messy.</li>
<li>It’s quite common for people to get more organized as they talk and it becomes clearer what they were looking for, so don’t put too much emphasis on the first statement…</li>

</li>
<li>If you cut too much with NGKW before the keywords are developed, the “fountain has dried up”.
<ul>
<li>Maybe we are in a vicious cycle of using NGKW so much that the keywords are depleted, the program jumps to a keyword from the most recent statement and asks a question, which is off the main topic, so it is NGKWed again.</li>
<li>How can we successfully lead them to the state of being crowded with lots of keywords?</li>
<li>Show the percentage of the value to be achieved in each phase?</li>
<li>Point out that there are too few keywords and the pace of NGKW is too fast?
