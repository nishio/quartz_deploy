<li>Offer from an acquaintance in the company</li>
<li>boss</li>
<li>Bosses who are good at protecting themselves from the company but incompetent at their jobs.</li>
</ul>
<p>free-text entry (e.g. in online forms)</p>
<ul>
<li>It would be disastrous if ‚Äú<a href="./critic" class="internal" data-slug="critic">critic</a>‚Äù who does not (cannot) move his hands at all has authority!</li>
<li>I would like to be allowed to work in partitioned or private rooms if only to facilitate daily work.</li>
<li>I want commuting to be eliminated (work anywhere).</li>
<li>In terms of compensation, the company‚Äôs assumed career plan is vague, so it depends on how each employee works. Since it depends on the work assigned, it is impossible for some people to get a pay raise or promotion.</li>
<li>Good luck with the tally.</li>
<li>In the past, my job changes were based on my determination to change jobs! But recently, I feel that I have been loosely moving from one company to another, loosely taking advantage of the opportunities presented by the various contacts I have made.</li>
<li>I learned that it really is up to the president to change everything in the company.</li>
