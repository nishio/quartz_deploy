<li>Information Sharing Tools
<ul>
<li>I’m wondering which one to use. If it is a notebook, it can be used mainly by one person, but if it is an information sharing tool, it would be strange to say “mainly used by one person”.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Digital whiteboard
<ul>
<li>You can use it alone to get your head out of the clouds, or you can use it with multiple people.</li>

</li>
<li>Digital assists in situations that can be confusing when you’re thinking in your head to help you get your head straight.
<ul>
<li>Is it strange that digital assistance is a means to an end, so it’s not right to include it here?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The purpose of this service is to help people who are confused trying to think of complex things in their minds to become organized and clear.</li>

</li>
<li>means

<li>Sticky notes with pieces of information that can be dragged and moved.</li>
<li>Is this a common story so far?</li>

<li>Good for information sharing among multiple people in the same physical location.
<ul>

<li>Taking pictures of the whiteboard with a camera doesn’t share very well with the remote.</li>
<li>It would be nice if the digital whiteboard could be shared with remote

</ul>
</li>
<li>For single use
<ul>
<li>Actually, the legible and accessible area of a vertical whiteboard is not very large due to height limitations.</li>

<li>Hmmm, there are minor feature differences, but “why not just use Miro?” It’s hard to say…</li>
<li>Maybe, but Miro is not specialized in organizing information, so there could be a difference there…</li>
<li>I’m getting the feeling you’re not going to adopt anything.</li>
<li>I wouldn’t be persuaded to at least give Miro a try…
- <a href="./Comparison-of-Miro-and-Regroup" class="internal alias" data-slug="Comparison-of-Miro-and-Regroup">Comparison of Miro and Regroup</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>I feel that Miro is not good at all, but I need to explain why that is so that the audience can understand</p>
<ul>
<li>Regroup is focused on organizing 100+ sticky notes as an assumption, maximizing the limited screen space.</li>
<li>I get the feeling that Miro is not suited for organizing sticky gaps, shadows, and other things like getting stuck on a limit and failing to import after a few dozen stickies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well, aside from the comparison with Miro, consider what to do with the boost meeting if it were to be adopted.</p>
<ul>
<li>The prototype is pretty much done, but there is no point in appealing to the public about it because it will just end with “it’s done.</li>
<li>I think I’ll focus on what I want to do and my immediate concerns.</li>

</ul>
<p>What is this?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You’re blurring the axis of whether it’s a “digital whiteboard” for multiple people or a “digital notebook” for one person…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think the analogy to a whiteboard is rather misleading, since the envisioned use is to first put 100 sticky notes on it and then move them around.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wouldn’t compare it to a notebook or a whiteboard…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An AI that helps you organize by writing out what’s in your head and dragging it around.”</p>
<ul>
<li>You can’t do that.</li>
<li>AI is going to be too vague and picky.</li>
<li>But I’d like to assist there in the future.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’d say it’s widely done up to the point of “moving stickies around to organize your mind,” but there’s a limit to the number of sheets and such due to the constraints of physical stickies and whiteboards.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is like, for example, the kind of work you do on your PC now can only be done on the small screen of your smartphone.</li>
<li>Restrictions on video limit human intellectual production.</li>
<li>So technology needs to evolve in a direction that removes that limitation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let’s call it a “thought support tool.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What to make it for.</p>
<ul>
<li>The basic premise is that when organizing thoughts, it is very useful to put them on sticky notes and move them around as you think.
<ul>
<li>I need to be convinced here.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>But there are some dissatisfactions with the current tool.</li>
<li>So we need better “tools for thinking”.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What I’m struggling with now</p>
<ul>
<li>Can we assume that it’s “for one person’s use?”
<ul>
<li>The backend is Firestore, so casual collaborative editing is still possible, which is surprisingly convenient.
<ul>
<li>One person can both list on the wide screen of a PC and handwrite on an iPad + Apple Pencil.</li>
<li>There are cases where you want others to see what you have organized.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The fact that tools that support thinking are supposed to be used by one person may be a captive of the idea that thinking is something to be done by one person.</li>
<li>On the other hand, the “make it possible to edit together well” line requires a complete change of the server side to our own implementation, and I’m not sure if I should do that.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The current prototype was made while learning React and TypeScript, so the code is dirty, but I wonder if I should rebuild it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s demo the title slide.</p>
<p>Information density issues, hard to understand, so I’ll start by talking about the benefits of digitization.</p>
<ul>
<li>I’ll go ahead and mention the hassle of “digital to paper” because it could be countered by talking about OCR from paper to digital.</li>
<li>Everything needs to be done digitally.</li>
</ul>
<p>Assumed Questions</p>
<ul>
<li>Automatic placement with machine learning and physics
<ul>
<li>→I can do it, but I don’t think it will end well.</li>
<li>If it’s not auto-placement but presentation of related stickies, it’s possible.</li>
<li>Placement is a human intellectual product and should not be overridden by mechanical output.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Digital whiteboards</p>
<ul>
<li>Miro
<ul>
<li>Show them how to use it the way it’s supposed to be used and tell them it’s not good at all.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Assumed zone with more than 100 sticky notes.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, if you have about 20 sheets, you can do it with sticky notes on the whiteboard or with Miro, but if you have more sheets, it becomes harder to do it.</li>
<li>Even if you use your smartphone to do work on your PC.</li>
<li>Human potential is limited.</li>
</ul>
