Production of Engineers</a>, I asked, “Why don’t you give this intellectual production technique a name like the KJ method?” I was asked.</p>
<ul>
<li>I said, “I won’t name names.”
<ul>
<li>Deliberately avoided naming names from the time of writing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>for some reason
<ul>
<li>This manuscript was written in 2017.
<ul>
<li>I wrote the book thinking, “The paper method is useful, but it has a number of problems, it needs to be electronic.”</li>
<li>No digital tool had yet satisfied me.</li>
<li>After the writing was done, we started developing digital tools.
<ul>
<li>This led to the current [Kozaneba digital stationery to organize your thoughts</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I think in retrospect that at the time I was writing it, I had the feeling that the way I was doing it at the moment was not the finished version.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>2022 <a href="./KJ-Method-Study-Session-@-Loftwork" class="internal alias" data-slug="KJ-Method-Study-Session-@-Loftwork">KJ Method Study Session @ Loftwork</a> at</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I told him, “Let’s make our own style,” and “It’s good to exchange information about our own style.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: <a href="./name-your-own-style" class="internal alias" data-slug="name-your-own-style">name your own style</a> and might be easier to distribute/exchange?</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>And I thought, “That’s right.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for some reason</p>
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>It makes sense to create a <a href="./lingua-franca" class="internal alias" data-slug="lingua-franca">lingua franca</a> to share within the organization, but as a preliminary step, it might be a good idea to secretly give your methods a personal name (<a href="./Personal-words" class="internal alias" data-slug="Personal-words">Personal words</a>).</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Unnamed concepts are like liquid, elusive and difficult to manipulate</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Naming the concept allows us to manipulate it with a handle, like coffee in a mug (<a href="./Metaphor-of-liquid-in-a-container" class="internal alias" data-slug="Metaphor-of-liquid-in-a-container">Metaphor of liquid in a container</a>).</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>The first step before creating a common language is to give a personal name to your method.</li>
<li>It is easier to manipulate than unnamed concepts</li>
<li>By naming a concept, you turn that concept into an object that can be manipulated and handled with a handle, like “liquid is in a container.”</li>
<li>This is the story I wrote in <a href="./The-Intellectual-Production-of-Engineers" class="internal alias" data-slug="The-Intellectual-Production-of-Engineers">The Intellectual Production of Engineers</a> p.36 [(Column) To name the pattern.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compare with 2018 decisions</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing in a book with a name” is the equivalent of creating “a common language shared around the world.”</li>
<li>The 2018 decision “not at the stage of naming names” is “not at the stage of creating a common language.”</li>
<li>Giving a “private name” as a preliminary step is beneficial</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So I gave a tentative name to Nishio’s own style.</p>

<ul>
<li>I literally use it to create the presentation story.</li>
<li>Mixture of KJ method and [knee-swing (gymnastics)</li>
<li>Fragments of the story are on sticky notes.</li>
<li>Related stickies, stickies that can be connected and talked about, are placed close together or connected by lines.
<ul>
<li>Group items that have been determined to be spoken in this order in close proximity so that they can be moved in a single group.
<ul>
<li>With Kozaneba, you can even fold it up.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you decide to quit, just ungroup.</li>
<li>This is an act similar to the stapling of the Kozane Act

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There is a rough “top left starts, bottom right finishes” axis.
<ul>
<li>For example.
<ul>
<li>Self-introduction sticky note is placed in the upper left corner</li>
<li>If there is group work after the lecture, the connection to the explanation of the group work will be in the lower right corner.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Most of the remaining stickies are arranged according to the connections represented by lines.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Even if I started out writing out stickies with the intention of including them in a lecture, I gradually realized that it was impossible to make a story that would connect well with these stickies, and I would say, “Let’s leave these out this time,” or “Let’s just use this part as a stand-alone article.</li>
<li>On the other hand, when the “I want to go from here to here, but it’s too big a leap,” a sticky note is added to pause the conversation.
<ul>
<li>What’s the connection between these?” that <a href="./Questions-promote-verbalization." class="internal alias" data-slug="Questions-promote-verbalization.">Questions promote verbalization.</a>.</li>

</li>
<li>When building from scratch, a divergent phase around a theme, such as <a href="./Fireworks-to-think-about" class="internal alias" data-slug="Fireworks-to-think-about">Fireworks to think about</a>, may be interspersed first.</li>
<li>The real value comes when “it can’t be used as is, but has a relevant story to tell.”
<ul>
<li>Reusable:.
<ul>
<li>There is a lot of material already written out without having to verbalize it from scratch.</li>
<li>Proximity relationships in the original story are relationships that can also be proximate in the output story</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is the case when you can’t use it as it is?

<li>When constraints (e.g., audience prerequisite knowledge, presentation time, etc.) change</li>
<li>When some of the content has been updated over time

<li>etc. in a line.</li>

</li>
<li>Difficult sentences are, in the first place, complex network-like knowledge forced down into one-dimensional sentences.
<ul>
<li>Using directives and repetition of the same words to express “links”.</li>
<li>But it overflows the capacity of the reader’s brain, and he can’t remember, “Oh, this word was used earlier, which means it’s used in this way.</li>
<li>This is how the link has been severed and can no longer be restored to its original form.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You don’t have enough brain capacity, so it’s better to reconstruct it on the screen instead of trying to reconstruct it in your brain.</li>

<li>First, the “author-created structure” of the tree structure of the table of contents is reproduced.

<li>I don’t know if I have a record that summarizes the process very well.
<ul>
<li>At the stage where the tree structure of the table of contents was maintained and arranged, I didn’t see the benefit of sharing it because “it just changed the look of the table of contents”.
<ul>
<li>The two images at the end of the page <a href="./KJ-method-Let-the-chaos-speak-for-itself" class="internal alias" data-slug="KJ-method-Let-the-chaos-speak-for-itself">KJ method Let the chaos speak for itself</a> are part of the process.</li>

<ul>
<li>The above methods were separated by use case</li>
<li>But I also thought there were more generic things they were doing.</li>
<li>What to call this is troubling.</li>
<li>I am developing Kozaneba to make it easier to do my own style, but it feels strange to call it the Kozaneba method.
<ul>
<li>What kind of discomfort?
<ul>
<li>Kozaneba is a tool, calling the methodology the “Kozaneba method” is like calling it the “fountain pen method” or the “post-it method”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I can’t think of a good name right now, but this is like trying to put on a nameplate before the group is clear, so I’ll hold off.</li>
<li>technique
<ul>
<li>Write it down with a tool that allows you to itemize
<ul>
<li>I use Scrapbox, but that’s because I already use Scrapbox, not because it has to be Scrapbox.</li>
<li>Anything that can be exported on a smartphone, even a simple text editor.
<ul>
<li>Why a smart phone: because I often take walks and write things down.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Leave a blank line at large separations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Import into Kozaneba
<ul>
<li>Kozaneba imports multi-line text as a single kozane for each line when pasted
<ul>
<li>Miro should be able to do something similar.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It is important that the tool be capable of 2D placement</li>
<li>Kozane that are in consecutive lines at the time of writing are basically connected by association, so they can be placed in close proximity to each other.</li>
<li>Draw a line when there is a relationship between distant places.
<ul>
<li>Now Kozaneba is hard to draw a line between things that are far apart, so you have to draw it closer once you get there.</li>
<li>I thought this should be improved, but when I observed the work, I was troubled by the fact that many people left things far away from each other on a line, leaving them far away from each other.</li>
<li>Kozaneba makes it so that the longer the line is, the more transparent it becomes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Regarding the enclosure of fireworks
<ul>
<li>I’m usually not very enthusiastic about it.
<ul>
<li>I group them together as needed.</li>
<li>The group title may be left empty or given at random.</li>
<li>When folding a large number of sheets, make sure to put a title on the folded sheets so that the contents can be identified even if they are folded.</li>
<li>Keep important groups large.
<ul>
<li>When the kozane in a group is large, the folded ones are also made to be large.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Kozaneba does not have the ability to softly enclose, so it is difficult to do the fireworks properly.
<ul>
<li>I took a screencap and surrounded it with the iPad’s note tool (Notability) when I presented it as a case study this time.</li>
<li>The note tool is whatever I’m used to, as long as I can draw a line over the image.
<ul>
<li>Like GoodNotes.</li>
