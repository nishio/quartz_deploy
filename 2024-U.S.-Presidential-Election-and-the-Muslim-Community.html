href="./Muslim" class="internal" data-slug="Muslim">Muslim</a> community and its leaders took actions that were a significant change from traditional trends.</p>
<ol>
<li>departure from traditional support</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>American Muslims have historically been generally supportive of the Democratic Party, but in 2024 some Muslim leaders moved to support Republican candidate Donald Trump. In Michigan and other states, in particular, support for Trump spread among Arab Muslim voters, and local political leaders announced their support for the Republican Party, an unexpected development.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>opposition to Middle East policy and diplomatic attention</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The conflict in Gaza and the deteriorating situation in the Middle East have made the Muslim community even more concerned about U.S. Middle East policy. The Biden administration’s policy of support for Israel was particularly criticized and strongly opposed by some Muslim voters. As a result, U.S. foreign policy had a significant impact on domestic elections, causing an increasing number of Muslims to reconsider their party affiliation.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>results and impact</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The change in Muslim electoral behavior has also affected how they vote in battleground states in the U.S., signaling a further increase in the presence of Muslims in American politics in the years ahead. This year will likely be the first in which American Muslims will no longer be bound by traditional lines of support, but will make diverse choices consistent with their own values and interests.</li>
</ul>
<p>This may make the 2024 presidential election a turning point in the political independence and strategic choices of America’s religious minorities.</p>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Are there similar cases?</p>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/gpt/icon" alt="gpt.icon" height="19.5"/>There are several other examples of minority communities moving away from their traditional party of support and endorsing another party in U.S. elections.</p>
<ol>
<li>increased support for the Republican Party in the Latino community (2020 election)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>In the 2020 presidential election, some Latino (Hispanic) voters were noticeably supporting the Republican candidate, Donald Trump. This was particularly noticeable in Florida, where there are many voters of Cuban and Venezuelan descent, who increasingly support the Republican Party due to concerns about its socialist policies. This shift is an example of diverse voting behavior according to religious and ethnic backgrounds.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>some African American voters supported Republican candidates (1960s)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Since the <a href="./Civil-Rights-Movement" class="internal alias" data-slug="Civil-Rights-Movement">Civil Rights Movement</a> of the 1960s, many African American voters have supported the Democratic Party, but prior to that, there was much support for the Republican Party. Particularly during the post-Civil War period, when they supported the Republican Party as the “liberation party,” the Democratic Party’s pro-civil rights policies in the 1960s marked a major shift in the party support of African-American voters.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>shift in party support among working class whites (2016 election)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>In the 2016 election, a segment of working-class whites shifted their support from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party. This segment of the population had traditionally been considered Democratic supporters, but Trump’s appeal to their dissatisfaction with economic inequality and globalization helped to garner their support. This is another example of how economic policies can change voters’ support for a political party.</li>
</ul>
<p>summary
These examples show that it is not uncommon for religious and ethnic minorities and certain classes of people to move beyond their traditional lines of support to other parties on the basis of specific policy or current issues, and this is part of the dynamism of American politics.</p>
