Let‚Äôs think and play properly. The opponent is Hard AI.</p>
<p>Hmmm‚Ä¶lots of cards I‚Äôve never seen before.
First, think for yourself without looking at online explanations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fool‚Äôs Gold, First Look.
<ul>
<li>A treasure that becomes more powerful when gathered together. 1 gold for 2 costs is inferior to a copper coin, but if you get 2 out, they cost 5 gold, which is equivalent to a silver coin gold coin, and since they cost 4, they are a 5-cost bargain compared to a silver coin gold coin. The problem is that you need a considerable amount to cover it.</li>
<li>I feel like I have to buy these strong systems when they gather because I don‚Äôt want them to be bought up by the other side.</li>
<li>In situations where you start buying endgame victory point cards and the deck thins out, can you exchange them for gold coins? Nice.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hori Terminal Draw</li>
<li>Watch, first look
<ul>
<li>I feel that not consuming actions and requiring the disposal of one piece after seeing three pieces is very restrictive, and I wonder if it is effective in compressing the early stages of the video and the mansion full of video.</li>
<li>I have a feeling it will be a dead card after compression.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Butler, I‚Äôve seen it before, but what was it?
<ul>
<li>Draw, coin, and discard selection cards</li>
<li>If destruction is the goal, is this better than watching? After compression, you can use it for draws or coins.</li>
<li>Uh, unlike the lookout, it‚Äôs a terminal action.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Conclave, first time
<ul>
<li>+2 coins</li>
<li>If you have an action card in your hand that is not on the field, you can use it for another +1 action, so it‚Äôs really +2.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>duplication
<ul>
<li>Another card is acquired when a card with a cost of 6 or less is acquired in the tavern reserve.</li>
<li>You can earn 2 gold coins when you buy gold coins.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Duke Special Victory Points</li>
<li>harbor
<ul>
<li>Draw + purchase, lasts 2 turns</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>forging
<ul>
<li>Destroyed and cost combined to acquire</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Court, first time
<ul>
<li>3 times action use</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Chameleon Habits
<ul>
<li>Draws and coins are swapped.</li>
<li>Mhm, the conclave is turning into a draw card. Wouldn‚Äôt it be pretty good if you could use the card you drew after you drew it?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Project: Evil Deviousness
<ul>
<li>You can accumulate 1 draw right each turn.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Supply Check</p>
<ul>
<li>Action increase: Conclave, Court
<ul>
<li>Court + butler‚Äù yields 6 gold.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Draw: moat, butler, conclave + chameleon, landing place, deviousness
<ul>
<li>The devious ‚Äúaccumulate tokens and use them when you have a bad hand‚Äù approach sounds good.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Purchase: Boat Terminal</li>
<li>Compression: watchman, butler, forging</li>
<li>Attacks: None</li>
<li>Special Victory Points: Duke</li>
</ul>
<p>policy consideration</p>
<ul>
<li>I‚Äôd like to verify that the conclave can perform the drawn action.</li>
<li>Compression and buying a genus state seems like a good idea.</li>
<li>There could be a line to increase the dukedom all over with duplicates.</li>
<li>I‚Äôm going to play with this supply a few times, so let‚Äôs go the route of using something I‚Äôve never used before first.
<ul>
<li>Butler, deviousness. Thereafter, while compressing with the butler, buy fool‚Äôs gold for 2 gold, silver coins for 3 gold, a conclave for 4 gold and a landing place for 5 gold.</li>
<li>I think it is difficult to aim to draw out every turn because there is no easy-to-use action increase and draw. I would draw more to increase the turnover rate.
<ul>
<li>If the landing place comes once every two times, it‚Äôs always a +1 purchase, so the court + butler will be able to make good use of the 6 gold produced by the court + butler.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Let‚Äôs do it, Round 1</p>
<ul>
<li>AI has been playing exactly the same w</li>
<li>T3: Destroy the mansion and fool‚Äôs gold for 2 gold</li>
<li>T4: Conclave with 4 gold and silver coins, but learning is a priority.</li>
<li>T5: Butler, Conclave, Copper 3
<ul>
<li>I‚Äôm torn between discarding more with the butler or not and buying a landing place, because I just discarded two cards, so if the landing place comes in at this time, it‚Äôll be every turn draw and increase the turnover without compressing it now.</li>
<li>7 gold, so you can buy a court, but not now, I feel.</li>
<li>I have six cards left in the deck, so if I draw on the butler, the landing place I just bought is instantly shuffled.</li>
<li>Conclave, 2 draws with butler, copper coin comes, 7 gold, 5 gold to buy a landing place.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>T6: Copper Coin 3 Fool‚Äôs Gold 1
<ul>
<li>Buy silver? Draw 3 for a devious token?</li>
<li>Let‚Äôs draw three.</li>
<li>Steward, landing, 5 gold.</li>
<li>Backstage playing the boatyard and pulling a conclave.</li>
<li>Oh, but I also drew a copper coin, so that‚Äôs 6 gold. I can buy a gold coin.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>T7: Butler 6 copper coins
<ul>
<li>Compression or buy a gentry state for 8 gold.</li>
<li>Compress and buy silver coins for 4 gold?</li>
<li>Oh, and we‚Äôre buying more, so we can have fool‚Äôs gold x2.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>T8: Conclave, copper coins, fool‚Äôs gold, gold coins
<ul>
<li>Conclave with +2 gold and poof!</li>
<li>Shall we try the conclave + chameleon?
<ul>
<li>There is an option to use devious tokens‚Ä¶</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I drew fool‚Äôs gold x2 w
<ul>
<li>I wanted to verify that I could use the action card I drew.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>13 gold in total, purchase 1 <span>‚Üí</span> Province</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>T9: Steward, landing, 3 coppers
<ul>
<li>Well, first of all, I‚Äôll use the pier.</li>
<li>4 copper coins</li>
<li>Is the Fool‚Äôs Gold x2 subtle here? Conclave?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>T10: Opponent gains a province, will you turn fool‚Äôs gold into gold?
<ul>
<li>Hand, copper coins, fool‚Äôs gold x2, gold coins, so even if you discard one, you can still buy a genus state (Note: misjudgment).</li>
<li>Oops, you can replace any number of cards in your hand, or just one.</li>
<li>I was only going to use those eight gold pieces to buy the gensh≈´t≈ç, but I got a conclave and gold coins at the dock.</li>
<li>Oh, fool‚Äôs gold, if you destroy one of the two pieces, the rest is not one gold!</li>
<li>The chameleon conclave safely drew the fool‚Äôs gold.</li>
<li>Can I use an action card drawn in a conclave?</li>
<li>12Kin, Genus and Conclave</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>T11: Butler, Copper 4
<ul>
<li>Draw 4 cards with the devious tokens!</li>
<li>Chameleon Conclave with 2 draws</li>
<li>The landing sites drawn by the conclave can be used.
<ul>
<li>Correct behavior?</li>
<li>Well, if it‚Äôs available, we‚Äôll use it.</li>
<li>Draw more conclaves</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Chameleon Conclave Draws Conclave
<ul>
<li>I can use the original butler I had, but not the conclave.</li>
<li>Oh, because the conclave is already in place.</li>
<li>I have 13 gold now, so I have the choice of destroying the copper coins with the butler, or +4 coins with the butler and the conclave to buy 2 genus states.</li>
<li>I‚Äôm at the end of the line, so I‚Äôll buy a genshu.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>T12: Opponent also buys a province and has one card left, the score is 25 for me and 22 for opponent, and I have 2 gold coins and fool‚Äôs gold in my hand, so I cannot reach the province.
<ul>
<li>I was going to draw in a trick, I thought.</li>
<li>Oh, the gold coins came from the effect of the shipyard. W. Purchase of the province of the genus and victory.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://gyazo.com/58eda1a9db9a951ec5e2a2919dc8ec21/thumb/1000" alt="image"/>
The other party is a butler, a landing place.</p>
<p>second round (of tennis, etc.)</p>
<ul>
<li>We won easily, so now let‚Äôs ban the conclave and duplicate, duke and ducal.</li>
<li>I can‚Äôt get more actions, by the time I get the court, the deck is full, should I use less terminal actions?
<ul>
<li>And don‚Äôt even get me started on the boat docks.</li>
<li>I‚Äôm having a hard time deciding whether or not to compress with a butler.</li>
<li>Hmmm‚Ä¶ I still think the previous plan is easier to work with.</li>
<li>Duplicates move to the mat if you use them, so they don‚Äôt squeeze the deck as much?</li>
<li>Is it inevitable that the deck turnover will go down in the Duke‚Äôs Duchy anyway?</li>
<li>I feel like I should throw away the copper coins, though.</li>
<li>Should I play it as differently as possible to learn, or not include a butler, first hand silver + duplicate (duplicate stero)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>silver coin</li>
<li>Play duplicates, 4 gold to buy duplicates or silver coins, or silver coins, or, nay, insurance against accidents in hand with deviousness.</li>
<li>6 gold, buy gold coins and activate replication.</li>
<li>5 gold‚Ä¶ the dukedom is not ready yet, maybe a silver coin.</li>
<li>Reproduction, 5k gold
<ul>
<li>Three draws for deviousness!</li>
<li>10 gold.</li>
<li>buy a state of the genus</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>7 gold, buy gold coins and duplicate</li>
<li>6 Gold, Gold Coin</li>
<li>6 Gold, Gold Coin</li>
<li>8Kin, Province</li>
<li>Reproduction, 5k gold
<ul>
<li>4 draws by deviousness!</li>
<li>12 gold, buy a genus state</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>My opponent and I each have three cards, and we‚Äôll be done before we can buy the public domain.
<ul>
<li>Oh, right, I should have bought the dukedom instead of the silver coins.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>10 gold to buy a province</li>
<li>The other party also buys and loses.
<ul>
<li>Me:Province 4, House 3</li>
<li>AI: 4 provinces, 2 duchies, 2 villas</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>AI was again a butler plus a landing place.</li>
</ul>
<p>Third round with the same strategy</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Reproductions + silver coins</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>conspiracy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reproduction, fool‚Äôs gold at 2 gold</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>silver coin</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>5 gold, 2 draws by deviousness, gold coins purchased and duplicated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Play duplicate, buy gold coins and duplicate</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Buy gold coins</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>4 gold, 2 draws for deviousness, buy a gentry state</p>
<ul>
<li>Let‚Äôs buy public domain instead of gold from here.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reproduction, 6 gold, not gold coins, public domain, to be reproduced.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The other party bought a gentry state, do you want to turn the kingdom of fools into gold coins?</p>
<ul>
<li>If I change it, it will be 7 gold, so I‚Äôll pass.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>6K gold for public domain</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Duke for 6 gold, now that he has 4 dukes, he will have 4 dukes from then on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>8 gold. If you buy a genshu, you have one card left, if you buy a genshu, it is 33 to 30, and if your opponent can buy a genshu next time, you will lose the game in reverse.</p>
<ul>
<li>Possibly, there is a line that if you draw 4 in a devious way and get a duplicate, you can buy 2 dukes to make it 8 points 35 to 30, and your opponent wins the genus and turns it around, but the game is still not over by 1 point.
<ul>
<li>If that happens, I get 5 points in the public domain, so that‚Äôs an advantage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Which is correct‚Ä¶
<ul>
<li>8 cards in the deck, 12 cards in the discard pile‚Ä¶ the duplicate would be on the discard side.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Purchase of the genus state</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh, the duplicate came in the draw w</p>
<ul>
<li>W lost the game in a predictable upset.</li>
<li>Me: 3 provinces, 4 duchies, 2 mansions</li>
<li>AI: 5 Provinces, 2 Duchies</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let‚Äôs consider the side that draws with Undo.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Draw 4 in deviousness, play duplicate, 9 gold but buy duke and duplicate.</p>
<ul>
<li>The other party buys a gentry state, 35-36.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Public domain 40-36 for 5 gold.</p>
<ul>
<li>The other party buys a province and loses.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well, I still think it‚Äôs a little too much to ask for this line.</p>
<ul>
<li>But I felt that the frequency of duplicates is very low.</li>
<li>Can we get away with compressing it with a butler?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Round 4 to be done by butler + duplicate</p>
<ul>
<li>If you buy a butler and a duplicate on your first move, you‚Äôll have an accident, so either butler + deviousness or butler + silver coin.
<ul>
<li>I‚Äôd rather have a bad card than a silver coin because the bad card averages +1 card, so 1.4 coins per turn, and it compresses it even more.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Butler 3 gold, 2 discarded, fool‚Äôs gold.</li>
<li>3 gold and silver coins</li>
<li>4 Gold, reproduction</li>
<li>Butler, 2 copper coins, fool‚Äôs gold, mansion
<ul>
<li>2 discarded and fool‚Äôs gold.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reproduction 5 gold
<ul>
<li>4 draws for deviousness</li>
<li>The butler‚Äôs here.</li>
<li>Reproductions, gold coin reproductions</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The other party purchases a gentry state, and the fool‚Äôs gold is made into a gold coin?
<ul>
<li>If you do, 6 gold, if you don‚Äôt, 10 gold.</li>
<li>Let‚Äôs buy a genus state.
<ul>
<li>Looks like the other party turned it into a gold coin.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reproduction 4 gold
<ul>
<li>Hmmm, I only have one draw‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôll use it.</li>
<li>Here comes the gold coin!</li>
<li>Reproductions, gold coin reproductions</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Butler, 7 gold, fool‚Äôs gold. Would you trade a gold nugget of fool‚Äôs gold?
<ul>
<li>2 gold in exchange and a butler, and a genus state.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>7 gold, fool‚Äôs gold >> genus without exchange</li>
<li>Duplicate 4 gold, 2 draws with deviousness.
<ul>
<li>8 gold, duplicate, genus state.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The opponent bought the genshu and lost by one point.</li>
<li>Hmmm, this one doesn‚Äôt compress very well with the butler doing the ‚Äúdiscard two pieces and fool‚Äôs gold‚Äù thing twice.
<ul>
<li>Me: 5 copper coins, 1 fool‚Äôs gold, 1 silver coin, 5 gold coins, 7 others.</li>
<li>AI: 6 copper coins, 4 fool‚Äôs gold bars, 6 gold coins, 8 others</li>
<li>You have a lot of fool‚Äôs gold, you have more purchase rights at the landing, and you‚Äôre using the extra coins as fool‚Äôs gold.</li>
<li>Hmmm, here I used the boat landing too, it‚Äôs just an imitation of AI‚Ä¶</li>
<li>Okay, let‚Äôs use the conclave.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Round 5 in silver coin conclave duplicate</p>
<ul>
<li>First Hand Silver Conclave</li>
<li>6 Gold, Gold Coin</li>
<li>2Kin, Hori</li>
<li>Conclave for +2 coins, moat for 2 draws, 7 gold for gold</li>
<li>5 gold‚Ä¶by devious means.</li>
<li>5 gold moat, 6 gold in belly draw, gold coins</li>
<li>5 gold, duplicated here</li>
<li>5 gold moat, draw and gold coin</li>
<li>Conclave 5 gold, draw 6 gold, gold coins. I think I‚Äôve had enough by now.</li>
<li>6 gold duplicates, 2 public domain</li>
<li>Draw at moat, 6 gold, public domain</li>
<li>Chameleon Conclave, 12 gold, only one right to purchase the genus state.</li>
<li>Reproduction, 9k gold. Province of</li>
<li>2 gold moat, 1 genshu left, 12 points difference. Impossible. There are 8 devious tokens, not being used effectively. Even if I use these now, I can‚Äôt sow them because I only have one purchase right.</li>
<li>I knew, essentially, that the only additional right to purchase in this supply, the boat landing, is required for the deck.</li>
</ul>
<p>Round 6 at the landing site + replication</p>
<ul>
<li>First move is silver coins + deviousness</li>
<li>silver coin</li>
<li>duplication</li>
<li>7 gold‚Ä¶ gold coins, or rather, a forge or court that is not used at all?
<ul>
<li>(The courts don‚Äôt overlap in any way, no matter how you think about it.)</li>
<li>Can you dispose of a batch of copper coins by forging from a devious draw, or two silver coins into a gold coin, or a gold coin and a mansion into a genus?</li>
<li>Let‚Äôs forge it in.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>silver coin</li>
<li>Duplication and forging came together w
<ul>
<li>I‚Äôll send a duplicate to Matt and we‚Äôll get back to you on the forging.</li>
<li>moat with two gold pieces</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>5 gold for a boat landing.
<ul>
<li>Ah, there is a way to duplicate the landing place‚Ä¶</li>
<li>Maybe I should keep it because I can forge it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>6 gold for gold</li>
<li>Reproduction 5 gold
<ul>
<li>Opponent buys gentry and leads by 10 points, public domain replication.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>5 gold, you could honestly buy a public domain here, but you have 8 devious tokens accumulated, so what the hell, let‚Äôs use them!
<ul>
<li>9 gold, forging, 2 boat docks, moat, 3 mansions
<ul>
<li>I don‚Äôt see more action.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Forging destroyed 3 mansions, moats, and 1 copper coin to gain a province.</li>
<li>Purchase of the genus state with the remaining 8 gold.</li>
<li>That makes it 18-19.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>6 money, public domain</li>
<li>Forging, copper coins, gold coins, and dukedom2
<ul>
<li>hmm</li>
<li>Jusyu 1 point left, 10 point difference.</li>
<li>Draw 1 for deviousness.
<ul>
<li>Genshu is here‚Ä¶</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It would have been fun to win the same supply in two completely different ways, but it didn‚Äôt work out the way I thought it would, and the first plan was the most successful, so I guess it‚Äôs okay.</p>
<p>Oh, that‚Äôs right, I said, ‚ÄúFirst, let‚Äôs think for ourselves without looking at the online commentary. Let‚Äôs look at the explanations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Collect combo parts in duplicate.
<ul>
<li>Duplication is a terminal action, so it‚Äôs hard to increase with stero</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The reserve card is no longer on the field, so it is subject to the use of the conclave any number of times.
<ul>
<li>Scales from the eyes!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Forging is suitable for combo decks with easy cost adjustment</li>
<li>Pier Stello
<ul>
<li><a href="https://note.com/urihari/n/n2daca977a912" class="external">https://note.com/urihari/n/n2daca977a912<svg aria-hidden="true" class="external-icon" style="max-width:0.8em;max-height:0.8em;" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><path d="M320 0H288V64h32 82.7L201.4 265.4 178.7 288 224 333.3l22.6-22.6L448 109.3V192v32h64V192 32 0H480 320zM32 32H0V64 480v32H32 456h32V480 352 320H424v32 96H64V96h96 32V32H160 32z"></path></svg></a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I see‚Ä¶ I see‚Ä¶ I can roughly summarize them as these two.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pier Stello</li>
<li>Duplicate + Conclave for more action, and finally a combo deck that uses the Conclave 3 times in the court for 6 gold.
<ul>
<li>We need a landing place too.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Let‚Äôs do the landing stero first, Round 7.</p>
<ul>
<li>First move, 2 silver coins</li>
<li>4 gold, what shall I do, I‚Äôll be devious.</li>
<li>5Kin, landing</li>
<li>Draw at the pier, 7 gold, maybe gold coins.</li>
<li>Draws in the effect of a landing, 5 gold, another landing.</li>
<li>8Kin, Province</li>
<li>6 gold. Maybe we could buy gold, but I‚Äôm thinking we could do a devious 4 draw and then do a landing draw.
<ul>
<li>No! Let‚Äôs subtract all the copper coins and buy 12 gold w genus states.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2 gold came for 2 pieces of landing, 2 gold to buy something? Fool‚Äôs gold?</li>
<li>Draws the landing place under the effect of the landing place. 6 gold is there. Use the landing place! I buy a province.</li>
<li>21-18, 5 gold. There are 3 gongzhou left. I could buy the gongs honestly, but I‚Äôll have to be devious and draw two to try to get some upside.
<ul>
<li>Success! 8 gold, buy a genus state.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>3 gold on the landing, 5 gold on the draw. One gentry left, 27 to 24. buy gongs.</li>
<li>Draw!</li>
</ul>
<p>Let‚Äôs do a replication + conclave Round 8</p>
<ul>
<li>First move, butler + silver coin</li>
<li>Butler 4 gold, +2 gold to buy gold coins</li>
<li>4K gold, conclave</li>
<li>5Kin, landing</li>
<li>Butler Conclave 3 Gold
<ul>
<li>Chameleon Conclave draws 2 and plays butler for effect.</li>
<li>+2 gold to buy gold coins or throw away 2 coins, but let‚Äôs compress!</li>
<li>3 gold to buy silver coins</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>6 Gold, Gold Coin</li>
<li>Chameleon Conclave Butler
<ul>
<li>I have 7 gold. Discard and buy gold coins.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>4 gold at the pier, terminal action, so I‚Äôd say +2 gold at the chameleon.
<ul>
<li>Oh, I wonder if this will be +2 even if it is sustained.
<ul>
<li>No, you got drawn.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Conclave Butler 9 Gold
<ul>
<li>12 money to buy gentry and duplicates</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Shipyard duplicate 4k gold
<ul>
<li>Draw at the landing, buy genshu and moat.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Butler Conclave 9 Gold
<ul>
<li>Draw in chameleon conclave</li>
<li>Play the drawn moat</li>
<li>Butler Reproductions 12 Kin‚Ä¶
<ul>
<li>Play duplicate, buy genus state conclave, duplicate conclave.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>They bought two genshu and lost.
<ul>
<li>I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm putting together the combo very well.</li>
<li>Is it wrong that I bought gold coins without compressing them with a butler early in the game?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Ninth round split 5-2</p>
<ul>
<li>First hand, landing place, fool‚Äôs gold</li>
<li>Conclave with 4 gold</li>
<li>Another 4k gold, another conclave? A devious scheme?
<ul>
<li>I‚Äôll be devious.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Landing, 4 gold
<ul>
<li>Conclave?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Draw in conclave, 5 gold. Boat landing?</li>
<li>4 Gold. Conclave? Duplicate? Draw by deviousness, 6 gold, gold coins.</li>
<li>condominium boat
<ul>
<li>Draw in conclave, play the landing with increased action, 7 gold. Gold? No. Court? I‚Äôll play the court.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>9Kin, Province</li>
<li>court of congress
<ul>
<li>Perform the Chameleon Conclave three times at the Court
<ul>
<li>Is it possible to choose whether or not to use the habit each time instead of having to draw all three times?</li>
<li>Play drawn landing sites.</li>
<li>6 Gold 1 Action</li>
<li>More draws, 7 gold, ugh, was +2 coins right?</li>
<li>Buy more court already!</li>
<li>No, let‚Äôs forge it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Draw at the landing, court and forging draws back
<ul>
<li>6 gold for gold</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Conclave 4 Gold
<ul>
<li>It‚Äôs 9-26, and I can‚Äôt take it easy anymore, so I‚Äôm going to draw in a devious way!</li>
<li>Concon 6 gold‚Ä¶</li>
<li>Two draws at the Chameleon Conclave, the landing and forging came</li>
<li>Play the landing place‚Ä¶can‚Äôt do it (it‚Äôs already on the persistent card).</li>
<li>Discard 3 mansions and 6 copper coins in forging to get gold coins.</li>
<li>One more action and there is a conclave and a landing place, draw hoping to get an action in the conclave, didn‚Äôt, buy another conclave.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Conclave Court 4 Gold
<ul>
<li>Conclave at the Court
<ul>
<li>Once, draw and play the landing place, draw forging and landing place</li>
<li>Play second conclave, play forging, discard video and fool‚Äôs gold to moat.
<ul>
<li>Oh, you don‚Äôt get it in your hand, miss.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Third time, draw or coin, I‚Äôm torn. I already have 2 actions so I can play the remaining con ships. +2 coins would give me 8 gold and confirm the genus state. But if I draw, there‚Äôs a better chance of something happening. w
<ul>
<li>Draw! Conkons ship 9 gold.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Play the landing place, here comes the moat.</li>
<li>Play digging in the conclave
<ul>
<li>Oh, I‚Äôve already pulled this off.</li>
<li>I‚Äôd better get my coins out.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I‚Äôm pulling out, but 13 gold, dreary, 23 points difference, I guess I‚Äôm a gentry, I can‚Äôt catch up‚Ä¶</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hori con con forge court 6 gold, it‚Äôs the last turn now, so I‚Äôm going to be devious, here comes the gold coin.
<ul>
<li>court conclave
<ul>
<li>Pulled off at 1:moat</li>
<li>2: Forging to duplicate the conclave</li>
<li>3: Draw and execute its duplicate</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>conclave implementation</li>
<li>15 gold 3 purchased 1 duplicate. Hmmm, even if I get 12 points for the dukedom and ducal province, I‚Äôm still 20 points behind, so I can‚Äôt catch up. Can I just buy 3 dukes and score 13 points with the duke and hope that my opponent can‚Äôt buy a province on the next turn?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It didn‚Äôt work.
<ul>
<li>I‚Äôve got a feeling that if it‚Äôs put together right, we could go for it.</li>
<li>I guess compression is important‚Ä¶</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Once again, Round 10</p>
<ul>
<li>4-3, Butler, Conclave</li>
<li>3Kin, watch</li>
<li>Conclave, draw, butler play, buy silver coins</li>
<li>4 money, deviousness</li>
<li>The lookout, the butler, and the conclave. First, draw on the conclave, execute the lookout, discard a copper coin. Next, the butler discards two coppers and buys a moat.</li>
<li>Conclave 3 gold, draw a lookout at the conclave, discard copper coins. 4 gold‚Ä¶buy a duplicate.</li>
<li>Conclave the Watchful Butler. Conclave draws, duplicate comes in and is played. With one action left, he played 2 coins on the butler, bought a landing place, and duplicated it.</li>
<li>A moat, a lookout, and a butler. Not enough action, and it‚Äôs dreary, so three draws for deviousness. The conclave came!
<ul>
<li>If you call the dig at the conclave, you‚Äôll leave the action, +4 cards.</li>
<li>Two landing sites and a duplicate came (I wanted a conclave).</li>
<li>Oh, the pile is already empty, it‚Äôs drawn out, then I guess I have 4 gold now, but that‚Äôs all I have, I should buy gold coins with +2 coins at the butler.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Butler, duplicate, landing, 1 money. Not enough action, not enough money. Chameleon the landing place and pay for the money and buy the silver coins. This brings the total to 9 gold.</li>
<li>Moat, lookout, landing, 6 gold. No action! Bad draw! Conclave coming!</li>
<li>Activate digging in conclave, 1 piece remaining.
<ul>
<li>No, you only have one conclave.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Run a duplicate, buy a conclave for 9 gold, duplicate, add 3 more!
<ul>
<li>I feel like I‚Äôm screwed because my opponent has already bought 4 copies of the genus state. w</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>And ship ship 6 gold. Buy gold.</li>
<li>Hori Butler Con-Con Reproduction
<ul>
<li>Con moat, con duplicate, con butler, con lookout (empty shot because it‚Äôs drawn out), run chameleon landing with one action left, all used up!</li>
<li>14 gold 3 purchased. Public domain x3,duplicate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Draw 2 by deviousness. Skip the hand memo because you can probably draw it out.
<ul>
<li>Con duplication, con replication, con moat, con watch.</li>
<li>I just barely made it, but if I buy a victory point this time, it will be impossible.</li>
<li>12 Gold. Court, Duchy x3</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Con duplicate, butler. 8 gold, that‚Äôs troubling. I can buy a genus state, but I still have a 9 point lead. I‚Äôm 3 points behind with the duke x2 in duplicate‚Ä¶should I buy the silver at 3 or not‚Ä¶I would if the watchman didn‚Äôt have forced discard. Or if the butler has action +1‚Ä¶ Hmmm‚Ä¶maybe the silver coin.</li>
<li>My opponent bought a duke and withered. I am a duke, 6 points. Duplicate, landing place. I gain 2 dukes, and the tables are turned!</li>
<li>Court Conclave! Court Conclave
<ul>
<li>1: Con duplicate</li>
<li>2: Con moat</li>
<li>3: No action cards available</li>
<li>harbor</li>
<li>Con butler draw</li>
<li>I have a lookout, but I‚Äôm afraid to use it, I think I have another duplicate, but oh, it came with the draw of the conclave.</li>
<li>CON duplication</li>
<li>12 gold 3 purchased, duplicates x2. got 3 dukes and got 18 points. I have 7 gold left. Court.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Court Conclave Reproductions. Get 3 reproductions.
<ul>
<li>We‚Äôre up by 22 points, so it‚Äôs like we won, but it‚Äôs hard to finish.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>4 draws of deviousness. No conclave by any chance. 10 gold to buy a genus state.</li>
<li>Court steward, all in virtual currency, 8 gold to buy a gentry state.
<ul>
<li>We won 72-44!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I like that the conclave and duplicate pair can be used as many times as you want to get ‚Äú+1 action +2 cards + duplicate‚Äù.
<ul>
<li>I bought miscellaneous cards early on to feed the conclave, but I could have kept the silver coins and collected them for duplication.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Whew, at any rate, I was able to play against the Hard AI, win with a strategy I devised myself without looking at anything, seal that strategy, and win with another strategy, a draw with a landing stero, and a draw combo.</p>
<p>PS</p>
<ul>
<li>I also won at the landing stelo.
<ul>
<li>When you only have 1 action, you may not be able to use the draw, so make the landing place +2 coins with the chameleon</li>
