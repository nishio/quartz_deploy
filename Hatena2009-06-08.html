I just had a seizure when I saw this.

&lt;img src=&quot;http://gyazo.com/6de52ba5da1aa2075efa953b5a2f858a.png&quot;>

I drew this kind of thing. Koike style in the world.

By the way, Julien-Opie painted the body more solidly, but the reason he didn't is solely my lack of drawing ability.

I had a strong impression that they were &quot;off the top of my head,&quot; so I ended up like the above, but when I looked at it again, I realized that they are not that far off.

Like this?

*1244473567* Paranoia (card game) has arrived!
I had never played the TRPG version of the game, and I wanted to play it once because it is a famous game, but I wondered who could be the GM of the game. I was wondering how to make that game into a card game, and I was curious, so I bought it.

&lt;hr>

Well, well, it seems to be a game of 3 to 8 players, so one person plays for 3. Everyone starts out red. First you pick a team leader and the team leader gets promoted to orange. Well, I'm going to make a team of Ichiro, Jiro and Saburo, the leader. There are six clones by default, but since it takes so long, let's make it three. three clone chips are dealt to each of the three.

&lt;hr>

Next, turn over the mission card. Give 5 wounding points to the &quot;Kill the Rebel&quot; mission. The last player to do so is promoted one level, and the last player not to do so is demoted one level. Hmmm. That's easy to understand. Just hit them anyway.

Deal the cards. The leader is orange, so 6 cards plus the leader bonus, 7 cards. The other two players have 5 cards. They all give 1 wounding point each honestly, and the leader ends up giving 2 points with the flamethrower at the end. Ichiro: &quot;Computer! The rebels are down!&quot; Computer &quot;Very well, Ichiro is promoted to yellow for his achievement.&quot;

The second mission, &quot;Exploring the Outdoors,&quot; if the mission succeeds, the wounded player is promoted; if not, +3 treason points; if the mission fails, everyone loses a clone; if the mission fails, everyone loses a clone; if the mission fails, everyone loses a clone. So if you make it back alive, you are promoted if you are honorably wounded, or you can shoot yourself? 'Mm, as long as you don't die. Players who are dead don't get success rewards... but it's not explicitly stated. It doesn't specify what happens when the number of wounded tokens exceeds the allowed amount, so I don't know if you are left holding the tokens as inactive, or if a clone will come at the start of the next mission, or if a clone will come immediately. Well, I guess the second.&quot;

Now, after refilling the cards, we start with the leader. This time, he uses the flamethrower from the beginning because he is rewarded even if he is not the last one to finish the job. Jiro uses agitation and has 2 wounding points as well. Saburo has only one card that can deal damage. Should he shoot himself this turn? But it's an ice gun. He has to rest next turn. Oh well. He attacks himself. Jiro: &quot;Isn't attacking a good citizen +2 treason points?&quot; Saburo: &quot;What, even though it's you?&quot; Jiro &quot;In the first place, attacking a good citizen is treason because it is destruction of property against computer property, right? Then wouldn't it be the same with self-inflicted wounds?&quot; Saburo: &quot;Mwah. Treason point +2.&quot;

Ichiro: &quot;Well, we could all shoot ourselves and receive damage and +2 rebellion points while completing the mission and we all get promoted one rank.&quot; Jiro: &quot;(...that would give Ichiro too much of an advantage, wouldn't it?)&quot;

Ichiro shoots himself with the laser pistol, Wound +1, Treason +2. Saburo: &quot;Ichiro is Treason:3. Next time he shoots himself, he'll be classified as a traitor.&quot; Ichiro: &quot;Mm...&quot;

Saburo has +1 wound point for the mission; the mission is completed with three remaining, but if it ends now, Ichiro and Jiro will be executed as traitors. However, as for Ichiro, he will be a traitor even if he wounds himself. It is a difficult point. Look at the card carefully. Mwah, there was a quick-action card limited to treason tokens. I just realized that when I canceled Ichiro's self-injury earlier, I should have canceled the Treason +2 as well. Mwah. At any rate, Ichiro has no cards to reduce his treason points. He has no other choice but to self-injure himself to get promoted to the next level.

Jiro also wounded himself and is now: mission wounded 5, Ichiro wounded 2, treason 7, Jiro wounded 1, treason 2, Saburo wounded 2, treason 2. Saburo said, &quot;Well, I guess so. Saburo said, &quot;Well, I don't have any more cards to attack the mission. He makes Jiro into a traitor with a wonderfully good lie. Jiro's treason +3, and I'm treason -2 because I exposed Jiro as a traitor. That means...&quot; Ichiro: &quot;Whether the mission succeeds or fails, we will die ourselves, so we should at least succeed and get promoted... But I don't have any attack cards left either. Let's use the medical bot to heal my sweet little brother Jiro.&quot; Jiro: &quot;Mm... I'm the only one who died in vain? Hmmm. If I kill Ichiro now, the leader will be Saburo, who has less treason tokens, and mmm. I use Plasma Cannon on myself and get a treason -3, so now I'm not a traitor. One card left.&quot; Saburo: &quot;I use Bribe to cancel the Plasma Cannon that was used just before and make it mine. Jiro remains a rebel and the plasma cannon is mine.&quot; Ichiro &quot;Then I'll heal Saburo too.&quot; Saburo &quot;You had two medical bots!&quot; Jiro &quot;It's the last card! It is a useless card, so discard it. End of play phase~&quot;


Computer &quot;Silly citizens. You had enough equipment but could not complete the mission.&quot; Ichiro &quot;(Enough for the mission, but I think it was at a level that would have made me a traitor.)&quot; Computer &quot;Ichiro, you did a great job. You are promoted to green. &quot;Ichiro &quot;Thank you!&quot; Computer &quot;Jiro and Saburo who were lazy are +3 rebellion points.&quot; Jiro &quot;No, I was not lazy... this is Ichiro recovering...&quot; Computer &quot;You think there is a mistake in my judgment?&quot; Jiro &quot;No, no, there is no mistake in computer's judgment! &quot;

Secret Police Phase

Secret police: &quot;All three of you are traitors...ZAP ZAP ZAP.&quot;

Jiro 2 &quot;Ichiro got one after all, didn't he?&quot; Saburo 2 &quot;You don't think there are two medical bots, do you?&quot;

&lt;hr>

Ichiro 2 &quot;Yes, yes, I'm going on the next mission! Do treason +3 to the mission. The last one to give a token gets a promotion, the one who hasn't given a token gets a demotion.&quot; Jiro: &quot;But we don't have a bottom,&quot; Saburo said, &quot;We have to do something about Ichiro this time. When the mission fails, the team leader and one other person are demoted, so why don't we just let him fail?&quot;)&quot; Jiro: &quot;(That's right. Or we could kill Ichiro.)&quot;

Ichiro: &quot;Hmmm...add 3 treason points to the mission using the treason indictment. Mission Complete!&quot; Saburo: &quot;Eeeeee!&quot;



Computer: &quot;Ichiro, you did a great job. Promoted to Blue. Jiro, Saburo... I'll let you off the hook this time, but this time you'd better work hard.&quot; Jiro &quot;...&quot;

Ichiro now has eight cards. On the other hand, the other two players still have only five cards.

&lt;hr>

Ichiro: &quot;The next mission is... if you give 3 injury points, the last one to give it will be promoted, huh?&quot; Jiro: &quot;Almost the same as before...&quot;

Ichiro &quot;(but the maximum injury points given is 1...) Happiness Officer, are you having fun Jiro? Not having fun? Not having fun is treason against the computer. Jiro's treason point +3! Cancel using bribe. Happiness Officer will be mine!&quot; Jiro: &quot;Thanks, Saburo. Can you wound the mission?&quot; Saburo &quot;That... unfortunately I don't have one.&quot; Jiro &quot;Well... I was thinking of assisting you. I modified the rubber elephant bot to attack Ichiro, wound +2. This is a machine run amok, so it's not my fault!&quot; Ichiro: &quot;Hmm. Well, I still have 3 HP left, so I guess I'll be okay.&quot; Saburo &quot;Apply Lie Detection Bot to Ichiro, Ichiro gets as many rebellion points as the number of cards he has!&quot; Ichiro: &quot;Tons of logic activated. Saburo is treasonous as he says I am treasonous in Blue Clearance. 7 treason points are transferred to Saburo. And capture gun to Saburo.&quot; Jiro &quot;Counter! So he invokes treason. Ichiro's outburst is treason. Cancel the capturing gun, and Ichiro gets treason +3.&quot; Ichiro &quot;Hmm, well, he still lacks two points to be a traitor.&quot; Jiro: &quot;Saburo, sorry. Abandon mission here. Add one more treason point to everyone and end the play phase.&quot;


Computer &quot;Getting hurt is treason. Ichiro. Treason point +1. total is now 5. You are a traitor ZAP ZAP ZAP&quot; &quot;Saburo also ZAP ZAP ZAP&quot;

&lt;hr>

The eldest son running solo, but with only one clone remaining!
Saburo: &quot;We have three clones and ten cards if we both work together. Brother, I will make up for my past grudges!&quot;

Now, maybe the last mission. Ichiro says, &quot;Well, give me 6 treason tokens and 5 wound tokens. You can't. The location is a nuclear waste facility, and at the start of each turn, you are given 1 wounding token for 1 point, and.... ...There's only one man left...I'll use the lie-detecting bot to make Jiro a traitor.&quot; Jiro &quot;Ummm,&quot; Saburo &quot;Impossible, brother. Give up here and beat Ichiro to death as a traitor.&quot; Jiro &quot;Oh, actually, I have plenty of weapons. Ichiro with a laser rifle for two points of damage.&quot; Saburo &quot;Then I'll be glad if you reverse or something.&quot; Jiro &quot;Is there? If you had that, you could have completed your mission earlier!&quot; Saburo &quot;Well...communication is important. Reverse the order of play using Reversing Ray Medium&quot; Jiro &quot;Continue, my turn, laser rifle wounded Ichiro +2, took Ichiro down! Ichiro &quot;Mwah, no medical bots this time...(Eternal sleep)&quot;

&lt;hr>

So the game is over. The player with the highest clearance wins...Ichiro wins? Ehhh...


Because I was writing a text, this play lasted 87 minutes. Phew. I was the leader from the beginning to the end. I had played two other times, but there was more of a downhill battle then.

*1244474870*Paranoia Design Considerations
Let's see. I think it's pretty much a problem when you're playing a multiplayer game where you enjoy the atmosphere alone, but anyway, &quot;counterspells are too powerful&quot;. Especially the &quot;can be triggered at any time&quot; card is too strong, especially when you can use it right after you are killed to cancel the action that got you killed. Just having one medical bot card in your hand is enough to revive you after you've been killed once. The same goes for other counters. Well, if everyone plays counters at the right time, it becomes a counter of counters and so on, and, eventually, it becomes a complicated rock-paper-scissors game. Well, that's how a game for enjoying flavors should be...

I wondered if there was any disadvantage to the leader because the leader has the advantage, but there isn't at all. The leader is always first. And as the leader gets promoted, the more cards he can hold, the harder it is to kill him. At least if the play is &quot;start with the person after the leader and the leader is last&quot; or something.

I also misunderstood the conditions for determining the winner of the game, the person with the highest rank wins, so when there is a big gap in the middle of the game, it's already too late to catch up. It's forbidden to show or exchange cards with each other, but it's clearly stated that it's okay to give each other oral information, so all but the top players should have colluded more to exchange information and drag down the top players.


Also, I still think this is a game to enjoy the world of paranoia. So, &quot;Attack with rubber band bots! Counter with a bribe!&quot; A &quot;Rubber Elephant Bot, don't you think B is treasonously dirty? How about cleaning him up?&quot; B &quot;No, A. Bot doesn't seem to think so. He doesn't want to work for you.&quot; Is it a good idea to do a role play of &quot;I don't want to work for you&quot; while holding out the card?
