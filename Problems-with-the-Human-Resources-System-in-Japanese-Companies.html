The main points are as follows</p>
<ul>
<li>During the company’s <a href="./period-of-rapid-growth" class="internal alias" data-slug="period-of-rapid-growth">period of rapid growth</a>, those who are capable and who are studying can get higher posts, but when growth stops, there is no reason to study because one’s career will advance just by being in the company.</li>
<li>Even if you acquire <a href="./IT-skills" class="internal alias" data-slug="IT-skills">IT skills</a>, you are treated as a <a href="./handyman" class="internal" data-slug="handyman">handyman</a> and not evaluated properly. [The work that can be done by someone who has been transferred from one position to another is recognized as “<a href="./business" class="internal" data-slug="business">business</a>,” and IT is not part of that framework.</li>
<li>Business is moving away from understandable <a href="./complexity" class="internal" data-slug="complexity">complexity</a> in HR and the old HR system is dysfunctional.</li>
<li>Reasons for not studying include that it is not useful for current work, it does not lead to promotion, there is no transfer without a post, and there is little mobility, such as changing jobs.</li>
<li>There used to be a time when you could be happy if you worked physically without studying, based on <a href="./potential-hiring" class="internal alias" data-slug="potential-hiring">potential hiring</a> and personnel transfers.</li>
<li>After learning at a company that educated but paid less, it sometimes served as a springboard to jump to another company.</li>
<li>In the IT industry, there is a tendency to focus on internal improvement activities and business evaluations while leaving technology to dispatchers without understanding it. In some cases, employees who study go to foreign companies or become independent consultants.</li>
</ul>
<p>These indications suggest that the human resource system and organizational culture of Japanese companies are no longer in step with the times. Various remedial measures are required, such as reviewing human resource development and evaluation systems, promoting the use and understanding of information technology, and diversifying career paths.</p>

As the organization expands, upper posts become vacant rapidly, so those who are capable and who are studying fit into those posts.</p>

There are few reasons to study: it doesn’t help you in your current job, you don’t get promoted even if it does help you, there are no transfers without a post (on the contrary, job rotations for no good reason after about 3 years), and there is little mobility such as changing jobs. Some people learn to mount up, though.</p>

Companies that educate but pay a little less than other companies
but taking education and immediate real-world training at a slightly lower salary.
I think I saw it was then used as a springboard to jump to other companies.</p>
