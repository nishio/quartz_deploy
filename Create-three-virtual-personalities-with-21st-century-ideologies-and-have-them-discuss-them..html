<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Write the degree of agreement or disagreement (+5: agree, -5: disagree) with the use of image generation AI in elementary schools from your perspective and the reasons for your disagreement.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/gpt/icon" alt="gpt.icon" height="19.5"/>
A - From the standpoint of digital democracy</p>
<ul>
<li>Degree of agreement: +4</li>
<li>Rationale: Proponents of digital democracy are more likely to support the use of technology to promote transparency and participation in the educational process. Image-generated AI allows students to engage with technology in an interactive way, fostering digital literacy and creative thinking. However, this assumes that the technology is used within a framework of fair access and privacy.</li>
</ul>
<p>B - From the standpoint of technological optimization</p>
<ul>
<li>Degree of agreement: +5</li>
<li>Rationale: From a technology-optimist perspective, image-generating AI is seen as an innovative tool in education and will be highly regarded as enriching the student learning experience and stimulating creativity. This technology will help foster future-oriented skills and help students learn how to interact naturally with advanced technology.</li>
</ul>
<p>C - From the standpoint of free market technologism</p>
<ul>
<li>Degree of agreement: +3</li>
<li>Rationale: From a free market technologism standpoint, we tend to support the introduction of AI into education as a market-driven innovation, but are skeptical of excessive regulation or interference by government or educational institutions. We are in favor of the use of AI in education if we believe it will enhance the competitiveness of companies and contribute to economic development. However, they will oppose the introduction of AI if it is mandated by the government or if it increases dependence on a particular vendor.</li>

The initiative, which sounds like something out of a comic book or novel, is being piloted at one public junior high school‚Ä¶ A line graph lines up on the teacher‚Äôs terminal screen. Which student‚Äôs line is indicated by a partial name and attendance number. The updates are every other minute, so it is easy to see the changes since the beginning of the class.‚ÄØ ‚ÄúWrite the degree to which you agree or disagree (+5: agree, -5: disagree) with each position on this case and why.

A - From the standpoint of digital democracy</p>
<ul>
<li>Degree of opposition: -2</li>
<li>Rationale: Supporters of digital democracy are fundamentally positive about utilizing technology, but would have privacy concerns about real-time monitoring of student concentration.</li>
<li>Such a system must be transparent and operate with the consent of students and parents.</li>
<li>In addition, clear guidelines must be in place regarding the handling of data and how that data will be used.</li>
</ul>
<p>B - From the standpoint of technological optimization</p>
<ul>
<li>Degree of agreement: +3</li>
<li>Rationale: A technology-optimist might believe that such an innovative initiative would provide [* an opportunity to improve the quality of education.</li>
<li>Optimizing student focus on learning and enabling teachers to address individual needs is seen as a way to enhance personalized instruction and improve educational outcomes.</li>
<li>However, privacy considerations and secure management of data are also important.</li>
</ul>
<p>C - From the standpoint of free market technologism</p>
<ul>
<li>Degree of opposition: -3</li>
<li>Rationale: Because proponents of free market technologism value innovation and individual freedom in the field of education, they may oppose any system of student monitoring implemented by the government or schools.</li>
<li>One might think that such a system would limit competition and distort natural choice by the market.</li>
<li>Concerns about invasion of privacy and abuse of data are also reasons for opposition.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these positions reflects a broad philosophical and ethical perspective on the use of technology in education. While each emphasizes different points of view, the common thread is the importance of privacy and data protection in the implementation of new technologies.</p>

<p>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Nice split of pros and cons.<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/></li>
<li>Predictably, the ‚Äúopportunity to improve the quality of education‚Äù v.s. ‚Äúconcern about invasion of privacy‚Äù conflict.</li>
<li>Interesting that C is against the ‚Äústudent monitoring system‚Äù because of its emphasis on ‚Äúpersonal freedom‚Äù.
<ul>
<li>I think this depends on how you ask, ‚ÄúShould the government ban this?‚Äù I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm going to disagree.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Should the government prohibit the implementation of such a student monitoring system? From each side, write the degree of approval or disapproval (+5: approval, -5: disapproval) and the reasons.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/gpt/icon" alt="gpt.icon" height="19.5"/></p>
<ul>
<li>A - From the standpoint of digital democracy
<ul>
<li>Degree of agreement: +3</li>
<li>Rationale: Supporters of digital democracy may support government intervention in the implementation of such student monitoring systems because they place great value on public welfare, especially personal privacy and the proper use of public data. They value transparency, individual freedom, and the ability of citizens to understand and control how their data is being used by technology. However, they may take the position of allowing surveillance systems to operate through strict regulation and transparent processes, rather than an outright ban.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>B - From the standpoint of technological optimization
<ul>
<li>Degree of opposition: -4</li>
<li>Rationale: Technology Optimists believe that technology improves the quality of education and often focus on the benefits that student monitoring systems bring. They will believe that technology will increase the personalization and efficiency of education and lead to better learning outcomes. They believe that appropriate regulation, rather than a blanket ban by the government, can protect individual privacy and at the same time promote innovation in education.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>C - From the standpoint of free market technologism
<ul>
<li>Degree of agreement: +2</li>
<li>Rationale: Proponents of free market technologism are generally skeptical of excessive government intervention, but may acknowledge that government should intervene in actions that may undermine competition and innovation. They may support government regulation or prohibition if they believe that student monitoring systems impede competition and delay the emergence of market solutions. However, this position would prefer measures that encourage natural market adjustments over regulation, and would seek to balance privacy protection and innovation through regulation rather than outright prohibition.</li>

<li>I see.<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>
<ul>
<li>After all, my ideology tends toward B, so I thought, ‚ÄúIf this is the way I hear it, wouldn‚Äôt C agree with B?‚Äù But in fact, this virtual personality did not agree with me.</li>
<li>Of course, how real people would react is unknown, but I found it useful to have three virtual personalities each giving their own opinion as a walloping role in the thinking process.</li>
