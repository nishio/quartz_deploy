Well, making tea alone is definitely convivial, and making something for yourself with a 3D printer is also convivial, I agree. Iriichi: “People don’t just need to acquire things. …need the freedom to create things, the freedom to give them form according to one’s own taste, the freedom to use them for others…” p.39</p>
<ul>
<li>Deprivation of conviviality = demotion to mere consumer status</li>
<li>My idea that “virtual offices should be able to make their own changes, not simply enter and use a world that someone else has created” means that “to be placed in the position of a mere consumer of something someone else has created is a deprivation of conviviality, of the freedom to give it form according to one’s own taste. It is a state of being deprived of the freedom to give it shape according to one’s own taste.</li>
<li>This use of the term “convivial army” on p. 34 also makes sense. In other words, “guerrilla soldiers” that are individually handcrafted are convivial armies, while mass production and mass deployment of the same are not. We are talking about the latter losing out to the former.</li>
<li>As for the question that made me decide to read “Tools for Conviviality”, “Should groupware be a tool for conviviality?”, yes, Kintone is definitely a tool for creating a convivial information system.
<ul>
<li>This is exactly what p.39 says.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There are some things that are convivial tools by their very structure. The telephone is one example. …anyone can talk about whatever he wants to talk about with whomever he chooses.” p.62</li>
<li>As rides get faster, it becomes more and more important to keep them full all the time.” p. 180 Uke.</li>
<li>Looking back, I was sharp enough to turn to Minecraft’s multiplayer server as a service to supplement the “necessary meetings can be held via videoconference, but something is missing” in remote work at With Corona (self-praise).
<ul>
<li>Microcosmos is a tool for conviviality.</li>
<li>The freedom to create what you want to create, the freedom to change the shape as you see fit, and the freedom to create things “to help others” due to the multiplayer nature of the game.</li>
<li>That said, maybe we should think of it as a set of Scrapboxes with written explanations, rather than the Mycla server by itself. It is two sides of the same coin to put a teleporter so that people who want to play in Mycla can move to the 1.18 region, and to write an explanation that they should use it because it is placed there.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Conviviality when we say “a tool for conviviality” or “a tool is convivial” and conviviality when we say “a convivial society” are two different concepts that are connected in Ilyich’s own mind but seem to be different in the long and thin view, and so he falls into one or the other. I’m going to take it down.</li>
<li>Ah, I see, why did Ilyich, who was a Catholic priest in the first place, quit because he criticized the Roman Catholic Church for sending missionaries to Latin America as a bad thing?</li>
<li>So you find a common structure in the church giving relief, the school giving education, and the hospital giving medical care.</li>
<li>If we go from school in an easy-to-understand way, mass-produced, homogeneous education is given in a descending manner, and the opportunity to learn according to the individual student’s situation is lost, and the ability to <a href="./learn-by-oneself" class="internal alias" data-slug="learn-by-oneself">learn by oneself</a> is lost. They are raised as people who only consume the mass-produced education given to them, and those who consume it well are made to be one and those who do not are made to fail.</li>
<li>I was wondering why the term “self-reliant symbiosis” was applied to “making things by oneself,” but this is indeed self-reliant symbiosis, a highly abstract concept that includes not only physical existence but also faith, learning, and medical care.</li>
<li>In that sense, “festivity” is not just “going to see an event that is run by someone other than yourself and consuming it as a mere consumer,” but it is a festival in the sense of “putting on your own festival, fixing the mikoshi you are carrying, and offering hot tea to the people working on the mikoshi. So it is a festival in the sense of “doing the mikoshi ourselves.</li>
</ul>
<p>Industrialist productivity
Impose limits on tools for conviviality.</p>
<p>Since “tools” are “means of production to create things,” and since “things” include “education,” “schools” are naturally “tools,” but schools that provide uniform education are not “tools for conviviality,” so “deschooling” is necessary, right?</p>

<li>Medicine creates new kinds of diseases.

<li>Increased demand for medical services</li>
<li>Welfare declines while costs and demand rise.</li>

<p>I saw a story once where two kids wanted to play against each other and there was no one to read the karuta, so they wrote a program in Scratch to read it out, and that’s conviviality, because Scratch is a tool for conviviality.
We’re not stuck in the belief that “we can’t make it, we can only buy it and consume it.”
Software, a kind of <a href="./manufacturing" class="internal" data-slug="manufacturing">manufacturing</a>, does not burn or cut fingers, so it is convenient as a <a href="./tool-for-children-to-create-things" class="internal alias" data-slug="tool-for-children-to-create-things">tool for children to create things</a>. And as they make things and play with them, they gain confidence <a href="./backed-by-experience" class="internal alias" data-slug="backed-by-experience">backed by experience</a> that they can make things. Isn’t it possible to create the “<a href="./leaving-school" class="internal alias" data-slug="leaving-school">leaving school</a>” that IRIICHI said was necessary?</p>
