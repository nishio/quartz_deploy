</ul>
</li>
<li>Principles of scheme evaluation
<ul>
<li>The value and valuation of the scheme depends on the aspect of experience that’s symbolized with the scheme’s help.</li>
<li>In my specific example <a href="Re:%20verbalization" class="external">Re: verbalization<svg aria-hidden="true" class="external-icon" style="max-width:0.8em;max-height:0.8em;" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><path d="M320 0H288V64h32 82.7L201.4 265.4 178.7 288 224 333.3l22.6-22.6L448 109.3V192v32h64V192 32 0H480 320zM32 32H0V64 480v32H32 456h32V480 352 320H424v32 96H64V96h96 32V32H160 32z"></path></svg></a>, I am verbalizing the answer to the question, “What are the benefits of verbalization?” I verbalize the answer to the question “What are the benefits of verbalization?
<ul>
<li>This verbalization is done with the help of a system of knowledge that has been created in me through my study of “the process of experience and the creation of meaning”.</li>
<li>This “verbalization with the help of a knowledge system” is here called “symbolization with the help of a scheme.”</li>
<li>Even in this specific verbalization, assuming that the other person has no knowledge of the “experience process and the creation of meaning,” I am able to change the language into words that seem to convey
<ul>
<li>The reason why I can do that is because these words are not just symbols, they are connected to a “felt meaning” within me</li>
<li>In other words, we’re in a state of “conception.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This idea is pragmatistic.<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<ol start="21">
<li>“scheme” is translated as “scheme. Scheme” means a system of theory, but we have chosen to translate it as “scheme”.
multischeme translates as “many schemes”.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>p.23</p>
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>In the past, meaning was usually analyzed in relation to things (objective verification, sense perception) or in relation to logical structures. Of course, meaning was considered to be related to experience, but “experience” was usually interpreted as a logical scheme integrating sensory perception, or as a logical concept mediating in relating or predicting the observed results of actions.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Today, however, we can no longer interpret “experience” in such a narrow sense. Besides logical schemes and sense perception, we have come to realize that there is also a powerful sensed dimension of experience that is pre-logical, yet plays an important role in our way of thinking, perceiving and acting.</p>

<li>In Gendlin’s terms, “the content identified and described” and “the process of experience per se.”
<ul>
<li>The latter is “the creation of new meaning.”</li>
<li>This is, in Spinoza’s terms, “the idea of an idea.”</li>
<li><a href="./infinite-regress" class="internal alias" data-slug="infinite-regress">infinite regress</a> is avoided because “the conception of the conception of the conception” is consistent with “the conception of the conception of the conception.”</li>
<li>The “conception of a conception” is the IOFI point, which is a multi-scheme</li>
