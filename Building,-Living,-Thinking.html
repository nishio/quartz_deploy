<ul>
<li>It was introduced in <a href="./Phenomenology-as-an-illogical-stage" class="internal alias" data-slug="Phenomenology-as-an-illogical-stage">Phenomenology as an illogical stage</a>. In particular, <a href="./Eugene-T.-Gendlin" class="internal alias" data-slug="Eugene-T.-Gendlin">Eugene T. Gendlin</a> focuses on “<a href="./dwell-think" class="internal" data-slug="dwell-think">dwell-think</a>” in this text, and I was interested in what he meant by the connection between <a href="./reside" class="internal" data-slug="reside">reside</a> and think, since I had never felt such a strong relationship between the two that I hyphenated them.</li>
<li>It’s hard to introduce it because it’s written in scattered parts, but here, for example</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>We do not need to surrender what is already formed. When we precisely understand its formed intricacy, that is just when we exceed its forms. When we don’t understand a book, we can only quote it. To understand it is to dwell-think in its forms, and that is more precise than the forms.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Translation: We need not surrender to “what is already structured. When we understand a complex structure accurately, that is the moment to go beyond that structure. When we read a book and do not understand it, we can only quote it. To understand a book is to dwell-think within its structure, which is a more accurate understanding than the written structure.
<ul>
<li>In other words, “<a href="./Understanding-is-dwell-think." class="internal alias" data-slug="Understanding-is-dwell-think.">Understanding is dwell-think.</a>” This is information I can’t miss as I want to understand what understanding is.</li>

<p>Heidegger wrote</p>
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Thinking itself also belongs to living, in the same sense as building, but in a different way.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>In other words, it is necessary to first understand in what sense building belongs to living.</li>
<li>Heidegger considers what these words “build” and “dwell” meant in the ancient language, rather than what the words mean today.
<ul>
<li>In the modern interpretation, “building” is done for the purpose of “living,” and “building” is a means to “living,” and the two are recognized as two separate acts.</li>
<li>But in the ancient language, “to build” = “to live”.
<ul>
<li>This “dwell” was a concept closely related to “stay” and “be present.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>From this, Heidegger believes that “to build is essentially to dwell” and that “to dwell is the fundamental trend of human existence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Next, Heidegger delves into “building
<ul>
<li>In addition to the meaning “to build,” which is similar to the modern “to construct a ship or temple,” the word “build” is associated with the meanings “to cultivate a field,” “to grow grapes,” “to protect the growth of plants and trees that naturally bear fruit,” “to care for,” “to look after,” and “to labor over.</li>
<li>In light of this, Heidegger believes that “the fundamental trend of dwelling is to labor.
<ul>
<li>By “exertion,” Heidegger is referring to “active” or “bringing something back to its essence.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Interpreting a word back to its original meaning rather than its modern meaning, as Heidegger has done up to this point, is a form of “laboring”.
<ul>
<li>This is not explicitly stated.</li>
<li>Heidegger wrote, “Thinking itself belongs to dwelling in the same sense as building, but in a different way. This may be testified to in the path of contemplation we have attempted in this issue.” He writes.</li>
<li>The whole thing makes sense if we consider that “interpreting a word back to its original meaning rather than its modern meaning,” which is done in this “tried and true path of contemplation,” is a kind of “laboring” in the sense of “actively bringing something back to its essence.</li>
<li>In other words, such a kind of “thinking” is “laboring,” and since it is “building,” it is “dwelling. In this sense, “thinking itself, in the same sense as building, belongs to dwelling” is valid.</li>
<li>I say “but in a different way” because “building” is creating “things as places” and not “laboring” in the same way.
<ul>
<li>(I did not explain how to do this because it is not the main topic of this page, but the original text says quite a lot about it.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>About understanding and dwell-think
<ul>
<li>Heidegger’s approach was to return to the original meaning of a word and look at its relationship to other words as a concrete way of working with it.
<ul>
<li>Original meaning, not modern meaning</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>One specific approach I took to laboring was to look at the words Heidegger used and see how they relate to other words, without interpreting them arbitrarily.
<ul>
<li>Not the dictionary meaning, but the meaning Heidegger was trying to express.</li>
<li>Words were placed on the Kozaneba to visualize the relationship.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>So both are “laboring = thinking” (<a href="./schonen-denken" class="internal" data-slug="schonen-denken">schonen-denken</a>).
<ul>
<li>This is <a href="./dwell-think" class="internal" data-slug="dwell-think">dwell-think</a> because labor is the fundamental trend of dwelling</li>
<li>As <a href="./Eugene-T.-Gendlin" class="internal alias" data-slug="Eugene-T.-Gendlin">Eugene T. Gendlin</a> said in <a href="./Phenomenology-as-an-illogical-stage" class="internal alias" data-slug="Phenomenology-as-an-illogical-stage">Phenomenology as an illogical stage</a>, “When we read a book and cannot understand it, we can only quote it. To understand a book is to dwell-think within its structure, which is a more accurate understanding than the written structure.” Let’s recall the</li>
<li>By this dwell-think process, I am not just quoting what Heidegger wrote, but I am able to verbalize what is not written, “It’s not written, but if you think of it this way, it makes sense overall” = more accurate understanding than the written structure.</li>
<li>It adds up against both Heidegger and Eugene Gendlin as I’m doing in this paragraph now.</li>
</ul>

<li>And then I wrote, “Do I really understand him?” I wondered, and decided to read what Heidegger wrote</li>

<ul>
<li>To verify if this “understanding = hypothesis” is correct, we put it into practice and observed the results.

<li>I found that my initial interpretation of “dwell” was different from what Heidegger meant by the word “dwell”.</li>
