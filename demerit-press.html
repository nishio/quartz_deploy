・ Children shouting “Hurry up and get me out of here!
・JAL and Coast Guard plane accident: “Did air traffic controllers mishear instructions?”
・JAL held a press conference saying that they had permission to land and that they could not see the presence of the Coast Guard aircraft.</p>
<p>[Foreign Press
“We witnessed a miracle.”
“The way they got all the passengers off that plane is almost unbelievable.”
・ “I was reminded of how much time the crew spent on evacuation drills. They did an excellent job.”</p>
<p>I have been watching the domestic and international media coverage of the Japan Airlines plane crash and the press conference, and I was struck by how shitty the Japanese media coverage and the attitude of the reporters at the press conference really are. Let me explain in detail what is shitty about it.</p>
<p>(1) Negative reporting attitude filled with malice, searching for allusions, and criticism
⇒We would like to express our deepest condolences to the Coast Guard personnel who lost their lives, but even though the crash was so serious that it destroyed a new aircraft, the pilots safely landed the burning aircraft in the fuselage, and the crew successfully evacuated all 379 passengers and crew within 18 minutes after landing. The crew was able to evacuate all 379 passengers and crew members of the aircraft within 18 minutes after landing.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is also miraculous that the airport was able to resume operations on the same day as a result of the efforts of all involved. All those involved in the response and recovery efforts should be commended, and in fact, the foreign media is taking such a tone. The Japanese media, on the other hand, did not praise the professionals who responded to the accident, and instead, they were always looking for mistakes and blaming the victims, such as screaming children and pets left behind. It’s so insidious and disgusting.</p>
<p>(2) Cottage articles that only use children as a pretext to stir up anxiety
The article is already a piece of shit when it simply explains the video footage provided by the passengers, but then it goes on to say that “children and women were screaming to be let out of the burning aircraft, and the flight attendants shouted for them to be seated,” and “the cries of crying children could be heard,” as if the JAL crew was at fault for ignoring the cries of the children. The fact that you are being so subjective and incendiary, as if the JAL crew was at fault for ignoring the children’s screams and responding to the situation, is a real bitch.</p>
<p>I understand that passengers are anxious and children are yelling to be let out quickly, but in the first place, the basic premise is that “flight attendants are security personnel, so passengers must follow their instructions in an emergency” and “in the event of a fire, if you do not know which doors to open, you risk flames entering the cabin and passengers falling in.” This is the basic premise. When the crew is struggling to save lives, if adults start screaming in sync with children’s cries, the cabin will be in a state of panic, and even the lives that could have been saved may not be saved. In such a situation, if a public media organization publishes an article defending children’s screams, does it not occur to you that some people may make the wrong choice in similar situations in the future?</p>
<p>“The crew was able to quickly determine an escape route and guide passengers without being distracted by the cries of children, and as a result of the calm cooperation of the passengers, all passengers were able to escape successfully.</p>
<p>(3) Arrogant and coercive attitude of reporters with “denunciation” in mind
⇒Not only this time, but why are reporters who appear at press conferences so irritable and scatterbrained, even though they can’t even ask proper questions?</p>
<p>To begin with, in the case of an air accident, the Transportation Safety Board takes time to thoroughly investigate the accident, so it is impossible to give out uncertain information when there is confusion immediately after the accident. Therefore, JAL could only respond by saying that they were “confirming” the situation, and they were sincere in their response. But what was the attitude of the reporters? They have repeatedly stated, “We are still confirming whether or not we had permission to land,” and then they say, “This could affect your company’s reputation, but you can’t tell us that yet? Who do you think you are, Asahi Shimbun? It’s a shitty attitude, as if to say, “We can make you lower your reputation.</p>
<p>Well, I guess there is a reason that they couldn’t write about any of the points because they were “still confirming,” but I was fed up with the reporters’ questions like “What was the intention of the apology at the beginning of the article,” “Tell us the captain’s profile,” “The announcement was flawed,” “No guidance after ejection,” and “What was the reason why there was no guidance after ejection. I was fed up with the reporters’ constant questions, which seemed to be a kind of foot dragging, aiming for a gaffe. Somewhere I’ve seen the excuse that “reporters are supposed to act ignorant and ask simple questions,” but I think they are just taking advantage of their position of acting ignorant and not studying. Honto kuso.</p>
<p>(4) Headline fraud by speculation
・JAL and Coast Guard plane accident: “Did air traffic controllers mishear instructions?”
・JAL held a press conference, “We had permission to land.”
If the reader only sees the headline, “JCG’s aircraft was cleared for landing,” he or she may think, “I see, so the Japan Coast Guard aircraft must have misheard the air traffic controller’s instructions,” but in fact, the actual cause of the accident is still unknown and under investigation. But in fact, the actual cause of the accident has not yet been determined at this point and is still under investigation. This is how they do the headline scam to mislead you into thinking that someone is at fault, and that’s why it sucks.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the question “Did the air traffic controller mishear the instructions?” is only one of the views presented by the experts interviewed by Asahi Shimbun, and other possibilities are also mentioned in the article. Also, it is difficult to understand the subtle nuance of “permission was given for landing” without watching the press conference, but the JAL side was merely speaking in general terms, saying that “normally, landing is done after permission is given” and that they are still confirming whether permission was actually given on the day of the landing. To put that in the headline as “permission had been granted” is already at the level of misinformation. Damn.</p>
<p>Especially in the case of aviation accidents, there are a variety of causes that are intertwined and cannot be attributed to any one particular person. What is important is to improve the system so that unfortunate accidents do not recur. If the tone is to blame human error and hang the culprits, then the next case may lead to a cover-up, resulting in an even bigger accident. Conclusion: Shit of shit.</p>
<p>It is fine for media companies to monitor power, but anyone can simply point out the bad points they see. I would like to see media companies return to the three principles of reporting: portraying the news without bending the facts, not including the opinions of those reporting, and reporting matters of divergent opinions without bias toward one side or the other. I would like to see a return to the three principles of news reporting. And while I say “do not include opinions,” personally, if there are points that should be praised or evaluated, I would like you to praise and evaluate them honestly (even if your political stance differs from mine).
