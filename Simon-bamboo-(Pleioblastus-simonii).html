They have two role differences: the noble species, which is particularly good at thinking and dexterous with its hands, and the laborious species, which is physically strong and sturdy, unfazed by anything. They are well versed in the labyrinths within the bamboo and are ideal for exploration and guidance.</p>

It is even said to be common knowledge that everything from weapons to armor is made of bamboo. Metal products are also available, but they are less easily processed and are more precious than bamboo, so they are often avoided. Only Bamboo Dwarfs have the technology to process metal.</p>

<p>The bamboo is divided into three ranks of materials: the copper-colored normal bamboo, which grows poorly, withers, and is inexpensive; the silver mirror-colored bamboo, which has a luster and a magical effect similar to that of a mirror; the golden-colored precious bamboo, which surpasses metal in its suppleness and sturdiness; and the pure white silver-colored bamboo, which is made by a special process known only to bamboo dwarves. The higher the bamboo rank, the more powerful it becomes as an armament.</p>

Another advantage is the ability to make your own weapons for emergencies if you have enough training.</p>

<p>The bamboo is divided into three ranks of materials: the copper-colored normal bamboo, which grows poorly, withers, and is inexpensive; the silver mirror-colored bamboo, which has a luster and a magical effect similar to that of a mirror; the golden-colored precious bamboo, which surpasses metal in its suppleness and sturdiness; and the pure white silver-colored bamboo, which is made by a special process known only to bamboo dwarves.

All members of the clan are equal around the matriarch and respect each other. However, those who do not take good care of their parents, those who are lazy and do not work, and those who do not follow the family code are harshly punished. There are many craftsmen, each with their own workshop. Work always finishes in the evening, and everyone drinks, sings, and makes a lot of noise at dinner.</p>

They follow the rules without question until they are no longer able to work. However, in rare cases, there are those who, because they are not comfortable with the prescribed way of life or because they are interested in something new, leave the nest where they grew up and wander the labyrinth of the world’s bamboos.</p>

But what they value most is honor. To die fighting the strong, to throw oneself into hopeless battles, or to side with the disadvantaged, is a way of life that each individual has discovered, and it is an honor that is greater than life itself. Perhaps because of this trait, some are even happy to become adventurers and throw themselves into dangerous battles.</p>

The world bamboo is a legendary giant bamboo that literally supports and connects the heavens and earth, and is said to be a thousand years old, surpassing even the smallest life.</p>
