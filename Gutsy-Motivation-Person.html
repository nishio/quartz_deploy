<p>The main points are as follows: 1.</p>
<ul>
<li>GYP will be the <a href="./driving-force" class="internal alias" data-slug="driving-force">driving force</a> that generates <a href="./breakthrough" class="internal" data-slug="breakthrough">breakthrough</a> ideas and findings.</li>
<li>More than the size of the organization or its financial strength, <a href="./GYP's-will" class="internal alias" data-slug="GYP's-will">GYP’s will</a> is <a href="./the-key-to-opening-up-the-future" class="internal alias" data-slug="the-key-to-opening-up-the-future">the key to opening up the future</a>.</li>
<li>On the other hand, there is a tendency for GYP to be marginalized as organizations grow larger. In the U.S., there is a culture of rewarding GYP with <a href="./stock-options" class="internal alias" data-slug="stock-options">stock options</a>.</li>
<li>GYPs <a href="./have-already-found-what-they-want-to-do" class="internal alias" data-slug="have-already-found-what-they-want-to-do">have already found what they want to do</a>, so <a href="./it-is-difficult-to-call-on-them-from-the-outside-to-join-them" class="internal alias" data-slug="it-is-difficult-to-call-on-them-from-the-outside-to-join-them">it is difficult to call on them from the outside to join them</a> in some aspects.</li>
<li>With the GYP at the core, it is important to surround him or her with people who can complete the assigned missions, and to push those who only talk the talk to the fringes.</li>
<li>An organization with GYP and his friends is strong, but if it is all GYP and <a href="./flight-attendants" class="internal alias" data-slug="flight-attendants">flight attendants</a>, it will be corrupt.</li>
<li>Some say they would like to be burned near GYP because it is difficult to be GYP themselves.</li>
<li>When you have a GYP <a href="./manager-who-reduces-motivation" class="internal alias" data-slug="manager-who-reduces-motivation">manager who reduces motivation</a>, the field is over.</li>
<li>Many GYPs are the type who have been thinking about it since junior high school and <a href="./immersing-themselves" class="internal alias" data-slug="immersing-themselves">immersing themselves</a> in <a href="./returning-from-holidays" class="internal alias" data-slug="returning-from-holidays">returning from holidays</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, the report highlights the importance of “people who can immerse themselves with passion” and the difficulty of management to make the most of such people. It seems that not only <a href="./expertise" class="internal" data-slug="expertise">expertise</a> but also <a href="./strong-will" class="internal alias" data-slug="strong-will">strong will</a> and <a href="./ability-to-get-things-done" class="internal alias" data-slug="ability-to-get-things-done">ability to get things done</a> are required in cutting-edge fields. It seems that the way of organization also needs to be changed.</p>

I think the reason why startups and huge companies that have raised hundreds of billions of yen fail is because of the presence of GYP (Gutsy Motivated Persons). Of course, there is also luck.</p>

This is true, but at the same time, for some reason, people tend to alienate such “GYPs”. This is especially true when the size of the organization grows, but I think the American IPO culture is such that after a successful IPO, the GYP are given stock options to liquidate and receive the money, so that they can leave the organization amicably. On an individual basis, it’s hard to have that kind of experience, so it’s hard to notice.
It is important for a person with GYP tendencies to be in an organization at a time when the organization needs his/her “motivation” as much as possible, and it must be difficult for the person himself/herself if he/she does not know how not to “leave a trail of birds in the air” at the same time.</p>

The best thing to do is to offer compatible material to those who don’t and have them become “I’m so stumped I realized I’m going to do it, Parson,” but in reality it’s rare…</p>
