<p>I‚Äôve implemented the ability to split long sentences for Regroup, and I think this would be beneficial to work with this chat system so we can talk and get our heads together.

I need to get my head straight.</p>

<p>What is the relationship between this chat system and long division?
Relationship between chat systems and long division
What is it like?</p>
<p>There is a separate display system that is not a chat system, and data can flow to it through long division.
There was another display system that wasn‚Äôt chat.
Through long division
There you go.
I can stream data.</p>
<p>So far the chat system has been like talking verbally with a counselor. After incorporating the collaboration I just came up with, it‚Äôs like a facilitator or consultant who organizes the discussion using a whiteboard.

Sounds like he‚Äôs verbally talking to a counselor.

<p>This one needs more significant changes. I also doubt that the chatbot form should remain the same.

I also wonder if it‚Äôs a good idea to keep it in chatbot form.</p>
<p>Maybe we should incorporate it into the whiteboard system?

<p>I want to use the chat system by itself, and I also want to use it connected to the whiteboard, so I need a system that is loosely coupled and can switch between the two, and if I want, I need a system that can be connected after the fact.

<p>In most commercial chat systems in the world, the company prepares data in advance, and the company‚Äôs customers ask questions to the chat system and receive answers. In the current implementation, the data is deleted after one session, but if this data can be stored and shared throughout the company, more interesting things may happen. In other words, this is the business model of groupware.

<p>You‚Äôre right, growth is not a must for a chat system. Rather than adding more and more features, there is an option to use resources for longevity rather than growth, for example by refactoring or porting to a different code base.
