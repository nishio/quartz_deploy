It’s insane to ask to exchange seats, because the person who bought the seats first has the right to exercise that right. If the person you are negotiating with is willing to give up their seats based on this premise, it is only because that person has an open mind, and the person who didn’t give up theirs is not small.</p>

I’m not sure if it’s possible to change or cancel after you’ve taken a seat, but there are usually people who ask if it’s possible.
This is a problem between customers, but from the staff’s point of view, it is usually a nuisance. They wanted to sit next to each other, so they should get seats earlier in the day, like the day before.</p>

This is an important time even if you don’t have a date. The freedom to watch from the seat you chose and bought is there for the lone visitor too.</p>

It’s not a “give and take”, it’s a one-way free ride.
People who say “you should do that much for them” afterwards are only thinking of the convenience of those who want to exchange, and are not kind at all.</p>

You don’t have the option to say no. Is it so difficult to talk to each other and give up your place in a public place? Some people are saying without permission that TSUNKU reluctantly accepted it, which is very disrespectful to TSUNKU.</p>

It is not a “place to help and give away”, but a contract where the buyer is buying the right to sit in that seat for a fair price.
I know that resellers, etc. have become a problem in various circles, but we should not forget that only those who have the right to sit in those seats are the ones who have the right to do so.
In the first place, it is against protocol to give up your seat in a movie theater.</p>

Asking someone to give up their seat is like asking them, “Would you be willing to violate protocol for us?” It’s a bit insane.
