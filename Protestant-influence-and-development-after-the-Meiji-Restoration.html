Treatment of Christianity in the Meiji Era
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>How was Christianity treated during the Meiji period?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/gpt/icon" alt="gpt.icon" height="19.5"/>The treatment of Christianity during the Meiji period varied from period to period. From the beginning to the end of the Meiji Restoration, the position of Christianity changed as follows.</p>
<p>Prohibition of Christianity in the Early Meiji Period: At the beginning of the Meiji Restoration, the policy of banning Christianity that had been in place since the end of the Edo period was continued. However, this policy began to change in a short period of time as modern treaties with Western powers were concluded and civilization was opened up.</p>
<p>Repeal of the Prohibition: In 1873, the decree banning Christianity was effectively repealed. This repeal was the result of revised treaties with Western powers and international considerations, which allowed Christian missionaries and the establishment of churches to be openly recognized.</p>
<p>Conflict with Christianity: The Meiji government promoted state Shinto, positioning Shinto as a symbol of national unity centered on the emperor. This led to tensions between Christianity and national Shinto. In particular, there were conflicts between Christians and the government in the area of Shinto events and the pledge of allegiance in school education.</p>
<p>Development of Christianity: After the removal of the ban, Christianity spread mainly in urban areas, and many churches, schools, hospitals, and social welfare institutions were established. Christian-related educational institutions contributed greatly to the development of education and culture during the Meiji period.</p>
<p>Influence of Ideology: Christian ethics, philosophy, and social thought influenced intellectuals and cultural figures during the Meiji period. For example, Kanzo Uchimura developed his own Christian-based thought and had many followers.</p>
<p>In conclusion, during the Meiji period, Christianity went from prohibition to acceptance, and then to partial acceptance. However, there continued to be a certain tension with national Shintoism, and harmony between the two was difficult to achieve.</p>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Please explain with a little more resolution about Christianity at this time, such as <a href="./Catholic" class="internal" data-slug="Catholic">Catholic</a>, <a href="./protestant" class="internal" data-slug="protestant">protestant</a>, etc.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/gpt/icon" alt="gpt.icon" height="19.5"/>Understood. Let‚Äôs take a closer look at the movement of Christianity during the Meiji period, with the division between Catholicism and Protestantism.</p>
<p>Catholic: Catholic</p>
<ul>
<li>History of persecution: Catholicism was the first Christian denomination to be introduced to Japan and spread in part through the activities of missionaries in the 16th century, but was suppressed by the shogunate in the 17th century.</li>
<li>After the Meiji Restoration: After the removal of the ban, the Catholic Church resumed its activities in Japan. In particular, French and Italian missionaries were active and gained many followers.</li>
<li>Hidden Christians: During the long period of religious prohibition, there were ‚Äúhidden Christians‚Äù who secretly maintained their Christian faith, mainly in the Kyushu region. When they were able to openly practice their faith during the Meiji period (1868-1912), some Hidden Christians joined the official Catholic Church, but many retained their own unique form of faith.</li>
</ul>
<p>Protestant: (English)</p>
<ul>
<li>Early Missions: After the Meiji Restoration, many Protestant missionaries, mainly from the United States and England, came to Japan. They established churches and conducted missionary work mainly in urban areas.</li>
<li>Education and Social Contribution: Protestant missionaries also focused on establishing educational institutions and hospitals. For example, <a href="./Aoyama-Gakuin" class="internal alias" data-slug="Aoyama-Gakuin">Aoyama Gakuin</a>, <a href="./Doshisha" class="internal" data-slug="Doshisha">Doshisha</a> founded by <a href="./Masahisa-Uemura" class="internal alias" data-slug="Masahisa-Uemura">Masahisa Uemura</a>, and <a href="./Nippon-Christian-Church" class="internal alias" data-slug="Nippon-Christian-Church">Nippon Christian Church</a> by <a href="./Shigeharu-Nakata" class="internal alias" data-slug="Shigeharu-Nakata">Shigeharu Nakata</a> are well known.</li>
<li>Japanese Leadership: Throughout the Meiji period, Protestant churches increasingly emphasized Japanese leadership. Japanese pastors and evangelists took the lead in leading churches and organizations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both denominations gained followers, especially in urban areas, during the Meiji period. However, there were many problems related to the relationship with the state Shinto religion and Shinto-like events in school education, and some Protestants in particular voiced opposition to this.</p>
<p>There was also an aspect of Christianity during the Meiji period that was accepted not only as a religion, but also as a part of modernization and civilization opening. Christianity during this period also played the role of transmitting knowledge and values such as Western science and technology, culture, and ethics.</p>
