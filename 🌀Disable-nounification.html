<p>Nounification” is a trait that treats actions like static objects, while “obsession with the nominal form” is an assumption that adheres to the nominal form. The “post-LLM worldview” states that “what has not yet been verbalized” cannot be the object, and “the hook for fishing out what has not yet been verbalized” requires a provisional word to verbalize the unverbalized concept.</p>
<p>Speaking with Verbs” explains the importance of using “verbs” rather than “nouns” to describe the design of the experience and the world we are striving to create. Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis” concludes that it is important to think deeply about the relationship between language and thought, especially the use of “nouns” and “verbs.</p>
<p>From the above information, we can conclude that it is important to think deeply about the connection between nominalization and verbalization, their importance, and how they influence thought and action.</p>

<p>In “Tentative Words,” he states that training oneself to express one’s experiences in words is the first step toward connecting words with concrete sensations and experiences.

<p>Given the relevance of the “superficial coined words” fragment, it seems important that the concepts to which the words refer be useful when creating the words. Considering the relevance of the “Judging by Actions” fragment, it would seem that not only words but also actions are important in making words. From these perspectives, what factors should be emphasized when creating a word?</p>
<p>In addition, given the relevance of the “post-LLM worldview” fragment, it would seem that training in expressing one’s experiences in words would be important. But how should that training be conducted? And what do we think we can gain through that training?</p>

<p>My previous research note was on the topic “Linguification is the abstraction of concrete experience”. This refers to the process of transforming the concrete events we experience into abstract concepts and words.</p>
<p>Nishio’s research note, “<a href="./Dig-deeper-and-see-circulation" class="internal alias" data-slug="Dig-deeper-and-see-circulation">Dig deeper and see circulation</a>,” discusses the training of handling abstract concepts without connecting them to concrete experience. This is closely related to my research, which shows the importance of maintaining a clear connection between concrete experiences and abstract concepts when abstracting them.</p>
<p>In “<a href="./Reproduction-through-labeling-that-verbalizes-the-experience" class="internal alias" data-slug="Reproduction-through-labeling-that-verbalizes-the-experience">Reproduction through labeling that verbalizes the experience</a>,” I explain the importance of labeling that verbalizes the experience and makes it reproducible. This is directly related to my research topic, which emphasizes the importance of representing concrete experiences in a reproducible way when abstracting them.</p>
<p>In “<a href="./As-yet-unnamed-concepts-that-emerge-from-experience" class="internal alias" data-slug="As-yet-unnamed-concepts-that-emerge-from-experience">As yet unnamed concepts that emerge from experience</a>,” you point out that there are new concepts and theories that emerge from experience that have not yet been verbalized. This is related to my research topic, which is the potential for new concepts and theories to emerge from experience when concrete experiences are abstracted.</p>
<p>Clean Language as 🤖🔁 Board Game</p>
<p>Train yourself to express your own experiences in words, connecting language with specific sensations and experiences. Review and brush up tentative verbalizations over time to make them more precise and expressive.</p>
<p>It is a deeper understanding of metaphor, which in turn leads to a deeper understanding of clean language. This is not a contest where ideas alone are evaluated, but whether or not those ideas can be realized.</p>
<p>As for how to end the presentation, it is appropriate to end with an open question to the audience about what is troubling you at the moment.</p>

<p>The “questions cause a flow state” fragment relates to the concept that Clean Language questions promote verbalization. The point that it is important to enter the flow state by considering questions of moderate difficulty is helpful in setting clean-language questions.</p>
<p>The “Intellectual Production Techniques of Engineers: A Reaction Summary” fragment discusses the phases of information gathering and is related to the study of eliciting information with clean language.</p>
<p>The “Conversation Log 2019-07-27-2” fragment has a discussion about the detection of languageization and is related to the goal of encouraging clean language languageization.</p>

<li>For concepts where the verb is in the noun form, I have found it beneficial to change it back to the verb form before asking the question.</li>
<li>I see, I understand. Indeed, I can clarify more specific actions and methods by asking questions after reverting to the verb form. I hope you will find this useful in your future communication. Is there anything else you would like to discuss?</li>
<li>What kind of input is needed to transfer the knowledge gained from this conversation to the next conversation?</li>
<li>Before you give your input, it may be helpful to organize and summarize for yourself the knowledge and insights you gained from this conversation. For example, we learned from this conversation that it is important to ask questions in the verb form, not the noun form. You can put that into your own words and summarize it as, “It is important to ask questions in the verb form in order to elaborate on a concept. In the next conversation, you can use such a summary to ask more specific questions.</li>

<pre><code>You are a counselor who listens to my statements. You do not give your own opinion, but ask questions for elaboration on my statements. You are not to offer any new information. The purpose of this conversation is to help my vague ideas become more concrete mental images, and to gain awareness that will lead to action. You use Symbolic Modelling. You direct my awareness to my inner self by asking questions. You must ask one question per statement. Don't ask multiple questions. You begin by asking me, &quot;What would you like to see happen in this conversation?&quot; and find the key concept in my response, then ask a question that elaborates on that concept. Ask questions to elicit characteristics, specific examples, and metaphors. After you have fleshed out the concepts, ask questions about the relationships between them. You should never answer a question. Never ask more than one question in a single statement.

<li>When we try to create language, it often takes the form of a parable or metaphor.</li>
<li>The words that just came out may not be understood by others without explanation.</li>
<li>But there is no need to be afraid.
You can put your thoughts out of your mind first, write them down so they don’t disappear, and then improve them into a form that people can understand.
Even if written in your own personal language, the words act as handles, and they facilitate the manipulation of your thoughts.</li>

<li>It is important to pay attention to physical sensations, experiences, and discomfort. They are not yet in words.
It is important to focus on what has not yet been said.
For example, physical sensations, experiences, discomfort, etc.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, as in the case of “birdcalls,” it is often the case that the concrete physical senses are disconnected from the language that is the handle.
There is a disconnect between the words that serve as handles and the specific experience.
On the other hand, handles are often disconnected from the concrete experience, as in the “birdsong” example.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, it is often the case that the handle is disconnected from the concrete experience, as in the “birdsong” example. In such cases, it is necessary to go down to the physical sensations and experiences and reconnect them with the handle. The goal here is to connect “what is not yet verbalized in your mind” with the handle as a word.</p>

<p>Nounification” is a trait that treats actions like static objects, while “obsession with the nominal form” is an assumption that adheres to the nominal form. The “post-LLM worldview” states that “what has not yet been verbalized” cannot be the object, and “the hook for fishing out what has not yet been verbalized” requires a provisional word to verbalize the unverbalized concept.</p>
<p>Speaking with Verbs” explains the importance of using “verbs” rather than “nouns” to describe the design of the experience and the world we are striving to create. Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis” concludes that it is important to think deeply about the relationship between language and thought, especially the use of “nouns” and “verbs.</p>
<p>The verb form is better than the noun form,” he says, preferring to write “production facilities become services” rather than “production facilities become services. The “not the continuity of an individual thing” suggests the viewpoint that an individual thing does not continue to exist, but rather is transformed into another individual thing.</p>
<p>Jiro Kawakita stated that “Jiro Kawakita did not say to abstract,” because the word “abstraction” itself is abstract, so it is not clear what specific action should be taken when one is told to “abstract.” In Study Session 1 of “Experiential Processes and the Creation of Meaning,” he states that “felt meaning” is involved in the “idea.”</p>
<p>From the above information, we can conclude that it is important to think deeply about the connection between nominalization and verbalization, their importance, and how they influence thought and action.</p>

<p>Given the relevance of the “superficial coined words” fragment, it seems important that the concepts to which the words refer be useful when creating the words. Considering the relevance of the “Judging by Actions” fragment, it would seem that not only words but also actions are important in making words.

<p>Nominalization is the trait of treating an action as if it were a static object, while preoccupation with the nominative form is the assumption of adherence to the nominative form, which is related to nominalization.</p>
<p>The “post-LLM worldview” states that “what has not yet been verbalized” cannot be targeted, which is related to nominalization. The “hook for fishing what has not yet been verbalized” states that “a provisional word is needed to verbalize concepts that have not yet been verbalized.</p>
<p>Speaking with Verbs” explains the importance of using “verbs” rather than “nouns” to describe the design of the experience and the world it aims to create. It also discusses the difference between “make” and “use,” and points out the different perspectives that each expression represents.</p>
<p>Sapir-Whorf’s Hypothesis points out that names vary by language and culture, and concludes that it is important to think deeply about the relationship between language and thought, especially the use of “nouns” and “verbs.”</p>
<p>He states that “verb form over noun form” is better written as “production facilities are serviced” than “production facilities are serviced.” He points out that we should avoid “obsession with the nominative form” and that the nominative form tends to be more abstract.</p>
<p>The phrase “not the survival of an individual thing” states that, apart from the viewpoint that an individual thing persists as an individual thing, there is another viewpoint that considers that an individual thing does not persist and passes on to another individual thing. The phrase “verb, not noun” is related to this.</p>
<p>Jiro Kawakita stated that he does not know what specific action to take when told to “abstract” because the word “abstract” itself is abstract.</p>
<p>He states that he has washed up the occurrences of “monika” in the Zhuangzi, and there are not many places where “monika” is used as a nominal symbol.</p>
<p>In Study Session 1 of “Experiential Processes and the Creation of Meaning,” he stated that “felt meaning” is involved in the “coming up with an idea.” He stated that in the process of “coming up with an idea,” there is a “thumbing of a state that has not yet been verbalized.”</p>

<p>The “post-LLM worldview” states that “what has not yet been put into words” cannot be the object. This is related to the idea of nominalization. Also, in “Hooks for Fishing Out What Has Not Yet Been Linguified,” he states that tentative words are needed to verbalize concepts that have not yet been verbalized.</p>
<p>In “Obsession with the Nominative Form,” it is noted that adherence to the nominative form is an implicit assumption. This is related to the idea of nominalization.</p>
<p>The “subject enlargement program” shows that enlarging the subject could be useful in supporting ideas. This is related to the idea of nominalization.</p>
<p>In “Naming Nishio’s Own Way,” he states that naming a concept turns that concept into an operable object. This is related to the idea of nominalization.</p>
<p>In Kozaneba Shugyo, he states that externalization of thoughts is important. This is related to the idea of nominalization.</p>

<p>The idea of nominalization is relevant from diverse perspectives, including targeting the unspoken, creating a provisional word for verbalization, adhering to the noun form, enlarging the subject, naming the concept, and externalizing the thought. Is it possible to explore the impact of nominalization and its efficacy more deeply from these perspectives? And how can the idea of nominalization be used to improve intellectual productivity?</p>

The “nominalization” staticizes the action, and the “obsession with the nominative form” is adherence to the nominative form. The “post-LLM worldview” states that the unverbalized cannot be objectified, and the “hook for fishing out the unverbalized” requires a pseudoword to verbalize the unverbalized concept. The “Verb to Speak with” explains the importance of using “verbs” rather than “nouns” to describe experiences and the world we aim to create. Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis” concludes that it is important to think deeply about the relationship between language and thought, especially the use of “nouns” and “verbs.”</p>
<p>In “Tentative Words,” he states that training oneself to express one’s experiences in words is the first step toward connecting words with concrete sensations and experiences. In “It is difficult to verbalize what we don’t understand,” he states that it is absurd to try to explain it in neat and tidy words.</p>
<p>Given the relevance of the “superficial coined words” fragment, it seems important that the concepts to which the words refer be useful when creating the words. Considering the relevance of the “Judging by Actions” fragment, it would seem that not only words but also actions are important in making words. From these perspectives, what factors should be emphasized when creating a word?</p>
<p>In addition, given the relevance of the “post-LLM worldview” fragment, it would seem that training in expressing one’s experiences in words would be important. But how should that training be conducted? And what do we think we can gain through that training?</p>

The “verbalization is abstraction of concrete experience” fragment illustrates the idea of abstracting concrete experience by putting it into words, and is related to the “hook for fishing out unverbalized things” and “tentative words” sections of the notebook. The “digest for sticky notes” fragment illustrates the idea of converting information compressed in one’s mind into short, easy-to-understand words, and is related to the “nominalization” and “verbatim telling” portions of the notebook.</p>
<p>The “Clean Language as a Board Game into a Concrete Implementable Idea” fragment illustrates the idea of training oneself to express one’s own experiences in words and to connect language with concrete sensations and experiences, and the “hooks for fishing out unverbalized things” and “tentative words” sections of the notes are related to the following.</p>
<p>The “segmentation” fragment emphasizes the idea of humans segmenting the world and is related to the “nominalization” and “speaking with verbs” sections of the note.</p>
<p>The “Keichobot automatic summarizer” fragment illustrates the idea that verbalization leads to action, which changes the priorities of resource allocation, allocates resources to previously unallocated actions, and creates movement, which is related to the “nominalization” and “verbatim” sections of the note It is related to the “nominalization” and “verbatim” portions of the note.</p>
<p>Words to express” and “words to communicate to the world at large” are two different things, and Fragments, which expresses with the former and then organizes it into the latter, describes the choice of words that play an important role between expression and communication, and is related to the “nominalizing” and “speaking with verbs” sections of the notes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Consideration
It is important to think deeply about the connection between nominalization and verbalization, their importance, and how they influence thought and action. It is also important to train oneself to express one’s experiences in words, and through such training, one can connect words with concrete sensations and experiences. However, we need to think more deeply about how we should conduct that training and what we can gain through that training.</li>
