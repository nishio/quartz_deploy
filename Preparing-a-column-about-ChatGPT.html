<p>impressions</p>
<ul>
<li>It was good until about halfway through, when I stopped asking questions because I felt bad about pouring over notes that weren’t in a conversational format.</li>
<li>I’m glad you asked the question about the progress of the merge with the traditional rule-based algorithm and what you see the value in.</li>
<li>The summary function could not be used because the log was 4857 tokens, slightly over the ChatGPT API token limit of 4096.
<ul>
<li>Manually split and summarized.</li>
<li>But if we’re getting close to the limit, maybe we could do a “it’s time to end this” kind of suggestion.</li>

<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>What would you like to see happen in this conversation? (GPT)
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>I’ve been approached to write a column about ChatGPT, and I’d like to organize my thoughts by talking about it.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>ChatGPT is a type of chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to interact in natural language.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>(Ignore
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>First of all, this is quite frankly like being asked to pick up chestnuts out of the fire and make a delicious chestnut dish that is different from other chefs, which is quite a reckless request.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>What exactly did you mean by the expression “picking up chestnuts in the fire” in your story?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>To put your hand into something that is changing at a tremendous rate right now, and to put what you take out into a paper that will be released in six months or so.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>When you said the word “paper,” what did you think of?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>On a related note, for a while now I’ve been asking myself, “What’s the point of writing books?” I’ve been wondering about that.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>You asked, “What is the point of writing books?” What type of writing do you mean by “writing” that you have been struggling with?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>That’s a little vague, I’m thinking that putting the output in a place that is not open access, or trying to express things in a one-dimensional string of sentences, both of which would be outdated.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>When you said “enumeration,” what did you mean?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>The representation of information by arranging words in a sequence is not efficient for human beings because it was only popular because it was inexpensive to reproduce information in that format for a while after letterpress printing.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>When you said “express,” what specific form of expression did you mean?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>In addition to being represented by a sequence of words, there are pictures, illustrations, and sticky notes arranged two-dimensionally.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>Did you come up with any other ways to “express” yourself?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>ChatGPT, in essence, means that the program does the part of representing information according to the user’s needs. There is no point in creating a written representation for human reading if I myself can give the program the network of knowledge to be represented
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>Please tell us how you understand the concept of “expressing.”
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>It is true that by trying to express oneself, one’s inner thoughts can take on a clearer form. However, the listener in this case does not have to be the faceless reader on the other side of the paper, but can be a chat with a trusted friend, or a chatbot that listens, as we are doing now.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>What is it that you value?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>He feels that it is valuable for his ideas to be given a clear form.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>What are the key elements behind the word “express?”
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Summary.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>- ChatGPT is a program that expresses information according to user needs</p>
<ul>
<li>There is no point in creating a human-read textual representation if the program is given a network of knowledge to represent.</li>
<li>I see the value in having my ideas clearly formed.</li>
<li>The listener does not have to be a faceless reader across the paper, preferring to use a chatbot that listens</li>
<li>There’s nothing to do next.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>I don’t have anything to do next.” Indeed, so far, the Next Action is unclear. As for the Next Action, this kind of conversation will generate a lot of seeds of content to write about in the column. Then I’m going to finish the column by making it one-dimensional on Kozaneba.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>The concept of “expressing” information through ChatGPT and programs was mentioned.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Yeah, that’s going to be an important key word. I have other fragmentary notes of things that might be good to write in the column, so let’s talk about that next. Since this column project seems to have more than one person writing a column on a single topic, I think it is necessary to explain the author’s background. I think the one that matches this story is the author of “The Intellectual Production of Engineers.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>Since we feel that it is significant for our thoughts to take a clear form, it is desirable for us to deepen our self-understanding through expression, which will lead to personal growth.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Yup. Fragmentary notes: implementation, digitization, Kozaneba, Keichobot, no more thought without implementation
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>Specifically, what actions related to “expressing” are important to you?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>We delved into methodologies to support the “expressive” acts of writing and speaking, and found the existing tools insufficient, so we created “digital stationery.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>It is important to clarify what exactly “expressing” means, and to delve into methodologies that support this act.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Ah, clarification of “expressing.” Kozaneba is a system that supports the creation of a larger story by connecting fragmented thoughts together through the digitization of KJ directions and the Kozane method. Keichobot, on the other hand, is a system that encourages verbalization by having a chatbot ask questions about what is in the mind that has not yet been verbalized
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>When you think about the concept and methodology of what you represent, what specifically do you think will be important?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Maybe to get used to using it and becoming a transparent tool.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>Is the concept of “clarification” important relative to the concept of “representation”?

<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>Kozaneba is a system that supports the creation of a larger story by connecting fragmented thoughts in the electronic form of KJ directions and the Kozane method, but what specific features does it have?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>KJ direction is typo, KJ method. Also, Kozaneba is off-topic for the subject of this column, so I think it would make the cut even if it were inflated. keichobot was rule-based until just a few days ago, but it was really powered up by ChatGPT.

<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>Keichobot, enhanced by ChatGPT from rule-based chatbots, is a system that facilitates verbalization.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Yes, I know. And a few fragmentary notes related to that: Meta released LLaMa, 2/24, which is more powerful than GPT3 even if the model size is 1/10; OpenAI released its ChatGPT API, 3/1, which costs 1/10; 3/4, I was approached for a column; 3/4, I was asked to write a column; 3/4, I was asked to write a column; 3/4, I was asked to write a column. It’s like pulling chestnuts out of a burning fire and asking them to make a chestnut dish that won’t be covered by other cooks.

<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>ChatGPT is online. But judging from the context of the question and the “project about ChatGPT”, I assume you are talking about what you would do with the tool, correct?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Yes, it is. I am now trying to pour through the fragmented notes once they are in place.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>Do you have questions about the information you wrote down, like “Jiro Kawakita,” “de novo,” or “Drucker?”
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Not available now. Continued, Scrapbox and ChatGPT. this memo is about not knowing what is the appropriate format for information representation that should be fed into ChatGPT, but Scrapbox is probably close to the right answer.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence-based dialogue system developed by OpenAI.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Scrapbox can make associations indelible by writing links, Memex-like. Also, bulleted items may be better passed on to ChatGPT. This was pointed out by Mr. Aoyama.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>ChatGPT” exists online.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>This is a brief paragraph. Question.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>What exactly do you think needs to be done regarding “ChatGPT” in your opinion?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Hmmm, what do we need? Maybe the human side needs to learn how to deal with this new entity. A change in mental models.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>In response to “ChatGPT,” I feel that humans need to learn how to deal with this new entity, so there needs to be a change of mindset on the part of humans.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Summary.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>- I was approached to write a column about ChatGPT.</p>
<ul>
<li>ChatGPT sees the value in expressing information in a way that is tailored to the user’s needs, so that his or her ideas can take a clear form.</li>
<li>We created “digital stationery” to support the expressive acts of writing books and giving lectures.</li>
<li>Keichobot is now more powerful with ChatGPT.</li>
<li>The emergence of new technologies and systems requires changes in human mental models.</li>
<li>Q: With the advent of ChatGPT and AI, what are the lessons people need to learn?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>It’s Jiro Kawakita’s “All data is a lie.” Some people expect AI to give them the right answer and are disappointed when it doesn’t. Expecting such a thing is not right in the first place.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>What did you notice about what Jiro Kawakita said about ‘all data is a lie’ and what you said about expectations and disappointments?”
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Jiro Kawakita believed that since everything has the potential for error, it is important to gather information from different perspectives to make a decision. I think ChatGPT’s ability to provide “different viewpoints” is beneficial. However, I thought it was funny that many people in the world expect the ability to provide “truth” and are disappointed because it is not actually there!
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>Its “ChatGPT” is a dialogue system that can express information according to user needs using artificial intelligence.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Question.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>The “ChatGPT” claims to be one of the most useful tools for drawing conclusions by providing people’s opinions and perspectives.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Yes, I do. Question.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>What more specifically do you want to address about the “column” you would like to write?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>By outputting them in this way, and then chopping them into fragments and using Kozaneba, a story is born from within that network of fragments.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>It refers to taking a thought or idea that you have taken in fragments and expressing it in a tangible form. This is how the story or the big picture is created.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>(You’re getting a little dim…
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Question.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>How did your talk about “columns” come about as a result of your exposure to this concept of “columns”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>That’s an abstract and difficult question. Let’s see, how did it arise as a result of contact? I was approached to write a column, which means that here the demand for language for a particular situation was clarified. In response to this demand, fragments of information bubble up from my brain. Some of them are in the form of sentences, while others are still in the form of fragments. After writing this down, it would normally be structured directly in Kozaneba, but since this column is about ChatGPT and I had just improved Keichobot using the ChatGPT API, I thought I’d put it in Keichobot. I haven’t checked now, but this chat log must contain information that was not in the original memo, and these were created by the “put it in Keichobot” approach to contact
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>The “column” is a clarification of the demand for language and fragmentary information that emerged as a result of being approached, and since this column is about ChatGPT, it can be said that the content deals primarily with ChatGPT as a keyword.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Yeah. Question.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>Keichobot has been improved using the ChatGPT API and may be useful for verbalizing fragmented information, but we have not heard any other specific details about its function or use.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>That seems off-topic for this column, but right now this conversation is being exchanged on a smartphone while walking along a riverside promenade.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>That “column” has not yet been written.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Yes. First, you must gather the material. If you start writing without that, you will end up writing while creating fragments that satisfy the demand of a very narrow view of “how to write the rest of the story,” which is a lot of work.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>Please tell us more about what kind of materials you use.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>These are the ingredients that make a story. It is the connections between them that make the story. Those who begin writing without preparing the materials will struggle to twist the materials that lead to the tip of the story they have written. Instead, they must first gather the material, connect what connects, create a network, and then decide what path to follow.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>We are still in the process of not writing. We are in the process of gathering material and creating a story.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Yeah. Question.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>Keichobot” is the name of the Chatbot referred to in this text and not a specific location.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Hmmm, well, it exists because it is offered as an online service. But it’s still a closed beta, so I’m not sure readers can access it.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>Keichobot is not a specific location, but rather an online chatbot that uses the ChatGPT API.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Yes. Question.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>These “memos” are bubbles of information that emerged from the author’s own mind in response to the specific circumstances of being approached for the column, and some of these memos have taken shape as text, while others are still in fragmentary form.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Yes, it is. Summary.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>ChatGPT is a language-generating AI, while “express” means to communicate ideas and thoughts using words and diagrams. is only one way to “express” the concept of “expressing”.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Right. Question.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>The term “form” refers to the state of the information written down, which includes both information in the form of sentences and information still in the form of fragments.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>That’s another interesting point of view. What is “form”? When it’s in your head, it feels “unformed” because it can’t be communicated. That is because it cannot be transmitted. If it is written down in the form of fragments, it can be communicated. However, it is difficult to convey what you want to say to others. It is easier to convey what you want to say when it is in the form of a sentence. But it is still not enough to release it in the form of a column. As I write this, I realize that the “column” form is just a request that happened to be made this time, but it is not the only goal. Usually, I tend to take the form of “implementation. This leads me to “No thought without implementation.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>This means that it is a form of writing in which several people write about the same topic, and it is one of the means by which they express their ideas.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Yes, the goal is to express the ideas you want to express within the constraints of writing on the subject, and writing a column is a means, not an end. Which reminds me, I was going to mention Mr. Qualia if I could, now I remember.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>It is a relationship in which the act of “expressing” is a means directed toward the goal of writing a column.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Correct. Things are not dichotomized into ends and means, but a network of chained arrows.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>It is a complex set of connections that link related concepts, ideas, and information.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Yes, so from that layered perspective, a project that aims to achieve an objective and writing that creates a story are actually the same structure!
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>What do you consider important when you are writing?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Okay, that’s certainly an important question. Usually when I am writing all over Scrapbox, I aim to promptly give it shape, and preparing fragments is rare. And yet, when it comes to writing this column, I am preparing in the same way I prepare for writing a book or preparing for a lecture. So the mode of mind is clearly switching, and why is that? That’s duration. Scrapbox can be written messily first, and then rewritten later as other ideas arise. On the other hand, this type of writing is fixed at some point and cannot be updated. So I want it to be something that retains value over the long term. I mean, what I think is important is that it’s something that has long-term value at the time of the deadline.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>The relationship between “fragments” and “columns” can be thought of as complementary: “fragments” are collected as the story material needed to produce a column, and stories are created by piecing them together.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Complementary? Well, in a way it’s complementary: there’s a column project that asks you to write something about ChatGPT, so many fragments are created to fill in the holes, then the fragments are connected to create something with a few more holes, then fragments are created to fill in the remaining holes, and when the two meet, it’s complete. And when the two meet, it is complete.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>ChatGPT and columns are different things, but does that mean that ChatGPT may be handled in columns?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Yeah.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>Is there anything about “fragments” that we can do to consciously contribute to their growth?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>If Keichobot asks a question of a fragment, the answer to that question is the growth of the fragment. If a human being were to do this, he or she could ask the words contained in the fragment, “What is this? Or you can show it to others and listen to their reactions.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>The “fragments” are in Scrapbox and Keichobot.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>I like the idea of searching Scrapbox.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>Fragments occur in the brain.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>By writing down the fragments that occur in the brain in Scrapbox, they can be used for future growth.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>What kind of ideas and information material are you referring to?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>If concrete daily information is placed in a slightly abstracted form, connections are discovered by Scrapbox by matching the abstraction with the concrete information of that day on another day.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>Scrapbox is an online notebook-like tool that allows users to freely write their ideas, notes, and information.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>(It’s time to end this.</li>
