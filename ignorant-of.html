Also, when I “like” someone, I assimilate and feel like a relative. So when someone points out a flaw, you say, “What?　I don’t get it. You’re me, so you do something about it. I’m perfect, so don’t point out that I’m not. I’m perfect, so don’t point out what’s not perfect because it’s wrong.</p>

The psychology of wanting to “pretend” that the one was not there, because there is a feeling that if you admit the one bad thing, you will see through the 100 things behind it. I can understand the feeling very well, because I wanted to be myself without any faults in front of the person I love.
However, from their point of view, that one doesn’t mean it didn’t exist, but rather it leads to the second flaw, “refusing to admit it,” in addition to the first flaw. They don’t disappear, but are strung together until the 100th flaw.
There is only one way to break this. Admit fault and change. I think this is both extremely easy and difficult.
What I want people who “hate” in the pattern of the tweaker to know is that it is not disingenuous to admit that you have faults and that you are wrong. On the contrary, it turns into a positive: “I am a person who can admit and change my faults.
I think it is extremely important in both love and marriage to have someone who can change you for the better. Each other, of course.
One point I would add is that you should not say to someone with that kind of mentality, “You wanted to be cool in front of the girl you like, but your pride gets in the way and you can’t be honest, so it can’t be helped, yoshi yoshi.
I wonder how Tweety got out of that and came to be able to analyze himself in the past.</p>
