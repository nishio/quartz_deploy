alias" data-slug="Extending-the-Red-Link-with-AI">Extending the Red Link with AI</a>, which we have been running publicly on this Scrapbox.</p>
<ul>
<li>Searches include other people’s Scrapbox data, books and papers
<ul>
<li>relevance

</ul>
</li>
<li>Since there might be some problems with publishing the generated results as they are without review, the output destination is a private project that is not open to the public.
<ul>
<li>Subsequent updates changed the search hits to output directly to Scrapbox, making it clearly unpublishable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The page is automatically generated by AI at the destination of the red link created like this</li>
</ul>
<p>mounting</p>
<ul>
<li>Load from local pickle
<ul>
<li>It takes about 5 seconds to read 100,000 records</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>About 7 seconds to perform a local vector search</li>
<li>It’s slow when you think of it as a web app response, but with the recent “throw a keyword or page that comes to mind, work on something else, and look at it after a while” style, it’s not a problem.
<ul>
<li>There’s about 10-25 minutes between when you throw the query and when I come back to check the results (I don’t measure it).</li>
<li>I’ve been updating every 10 minutes to begin with, and I haven’t seen a problem.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>impressions</p>
<ul>
<li>Do we really want to do it with “all data” or “all except this project <code>/nishio</code>”?
<ul>
<li>Generated using the keyword <a href="./Combining-knowledge-is-the-source-of-new-ideas,-which-in-turn-generates-further-knowledge-and-new-combinations" class="internal alias" data-slug="Combining-knowledge-is-the-source-of-new-ideas,-which-in-turn-generates-further-knowledge-and-new-combinations">Combining knowledge is the source of new ideas, which in turn generates further knowledge and new combinations</a>, which I already did in this project in my first experiment, I excluded it because it was not interesting because it hit almost all the pages of my project.
<ul>
<li>titles: <code>[&quot;🤖🔁 successful intelligence&quot;, &quot;🤖🔁 successful intelligence&quot;, &quot;🤖🔁 twist&quot;, &quot;Hatena2015-01-07&quot;, &quot;🌀Collaboration with AI&quot;, &quot;Increase personal productivity first&quot;, &quot;🌀successful intelligence&quot;, &quot;tkgshn/ Karabiner not working on macOS Monterey&quot;]</code>
<ul>
<li>Maybe the last one is random.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It may be possible to find unexpected connections by not excluding my own writing, but since I am the one who makes the query, it may be true that it will be more similar to what I have written.</li>
<li>I wonder if people find value in “Letting my data-derived AI live in my wiki” because it gives them a “different perspective”.</li>
<li>Not sure why I see the value of different perspectives in my own search from my own Scrapbox.
<ul>
<li>Is it really A?” in response to “It is A”. or maybe the same individual has a sufficiently varied point of view due to the accumulation of more than 10 years of experience including Hatena Diary, or maybe I am highly sensitive to read differences by thinking “[Similarity <span>→</span> What is the difference?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you exclude yourself, it looks like this (long story, so I cut out some unnecessary details)
<ul>
<li>titles: <code>[&quot;motoso/discussion&quot;], &quot;tkgshn/knowledge and wisdom&quot;], &quot;nishio-books/MOT knowledge creation management and innovation Ikujiro Nonaka&quot;], &quot;tkgshn/knowledge tightly coupled with business&quot;], &quot;mtane0412/suggestion through ignorance&quot;], &quot;nishio- books/idea generation method and cooperative work support Jun Munemori&quot;, &quot;tkgshn/knowledge&quot;, &quot;nishio-llm2023/Study of methods and systems to support knowledge creation process&quot;, &quot;blu3mo_filtered/dualism of knowledge and ability&quot;, &quot;motoso/wise company&quot;, &quot;blu 3mo_filtered/accounting systems&quot;, &quot;tkgshn/vaccine against false information&quot;, &quot;motoso/Think different&quot;]</code></li>
<li>It’s interesting that the sources are pretty disparate.</li>
<li>But this variance makes the current prompt less interesting to say.
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Notebooks and … fragments are related in that the combination and exchange of knowledge generates new knowledge and ideas.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>I’m mentioning three of them, not all of them, so it would be more interesting if you talked about how they relate to each other individually.</li>
<li>I’ve already tried an improved prompt in <a href="./nue" class="internal" data-slug="nue">nue</a>s implementation of this, so I’ll be importing it back in the future.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Later, I tried other styles, such as having multiple lines of text commented on instead of a single line of title, but the search results themselves are more interesting than the generated text
<ul>
<li>It’s not that the generated sentences are not interesting, it’s simply interesting to see the results of the vector search</li>
<li>If the interestingness of the generated results when done with my project’s data is 100, the interestingness in this experiment is 90, and the vector search results are about 300
<ul>
<li>I’m writing a summary of today’s experiment first, holding back the urge to write about each of them individually.</li>
<li>I think the individual stories are overly detailed.
<ul>
<li>Well, if you can just imagine the book part as “a system where books pop up and related pages open when you talk about them in front of a bookshelf,” you can understand how interesting it would be.</li>
<li>In the case of Scrapbox, the other person is still alive (and books can be alive, too, of course), so there is a possibility that the connection found by the AI here could lead to more conversation with that person afterwards.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>So, the vector search results that were only output to the console are now written to Scrapbox as well.
<ul>
<li>This naturally led to parts of books and such being written in Scrapbox, making it impossible to publish directly.</li>
<li>Well, if we were originally going to do something like this, it was within the realm of possibility that we wouldn’t be able to do it in a public forum, so that was the default.
- <a href="./Eventually,-you-won't-be-able-to-see-it." class="internal alias" data-slug="Eventually,-you-won't-be-able-to-see-it.">Eventually, you won’t be able to see it.</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The question of whether to include this part of the search results in the AI’s search is a difficult one.
<ul>
<li>Effect of increasing number of fragments related to interests</li>
<li>The effect of interferences between fragments of search results for the same keywords that happen to be next to each other, creating new ones.</li>
<li>Adverse effects of miscellaneous machine-generated data returning to input</li>
<li>Include them in the list once, and make a mechanism to mechanically remove them all together when you think it’s a bad idea.
<ul>
<li>2023-10-05 I think it’s not good, the mismatch between the title and the content is confusing</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>summary</p>
<ul>
<li>Just a casual post on a private project with a smartphone or something, and you can now see the results of vector searches across multiple people’s Scrapbox projects, books and papers.</li>
<li>We will improve it as we use it in the future.</li>
<li>It would be interesting to take not only the explicitly triggered ones, but also the ones taken from the recent updates of your project once a day or so, and generate them on your own.</li>
