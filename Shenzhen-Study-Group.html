<p>Instead of the speaker talking about the content of the lecture material, the participants watched the video beforehand, and the Q&amp;A session lasted the entire two hours on site. Interesting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mitochi Junior will be hosting a ‚ÄúDeep Sense Study Tour‚Äù for alumni in August 2019, and this is a pre-learning event designed to familiarize you with Deep Sensei in advance.
However, it would be a waste if it were only for people related to Unexplored Junior! So we welcome general participants as well as those from Chiyoda Senior High School, which has provided us with the venue, on the condition that they watch the following video in advance!
In order for the event to be more detailed and in-depth, with an emphasis on Q&amp;A, participants should be sure to read through the following video in advance.</p>

<p>Population Distribution in Shenzhen</p>

<p>Is the salary high?</p>
<ul>
<li>The city is becoming less and less palatable to factory workers.
<ul>
<li>Prices increase faster than salaries increase.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Not many factories in central Shenzhen due to environmental regulations.

<li>The U.S. has 10 million years and China has 165 million cities.</li>
<li>6,000 Maker Spaces have been created.</li>
<li>There were 200 in Shenzhen alone.</li>
<li>The Prime Minister actively visits the venture and gets the press to report on it.

<li>The country will feature the person who can write the best program in China.</li>

<p>Faire has different colors in different regions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Faire in Hong Kong is run by university professors, so there is a high percentage of education-related</li>
<li>Shenzhen will have more hobby projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>MakerFaire went bankrupt, how does that affect you?</p>
<ul>
<li>The American MakerFaire received a billion yen and melted it down in two years.</li>
<li>Other countries just pay a license fee, so there‚Äôs no problem.</li>
<li>They did what they put their money into that didn‚Äôt make money.

<li>Timing was good.
<ul>
<li>Shenzhen was built because Shenzhen received orders from around the world.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you build a special economic zone where there is nothing, no one will come. If you build it where it is already popular, vested interests will complain.
<ul>
<li>Shenzhen had Hong Kong next door, but the mainland side was a blank slate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Xiamen, on the other side of Taiwan, which became a special economic zone at the same time, has also been fairly successful.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Is innovation a matter of money?</p>
<ul>
<li>It‚Äôs not a matter of money, it‚Äôs a matter of will.</li>
<li>Creating something new is creating something that doesn‚Äôt exist now, so the lack of a track record makes it look suspicious.</li>
<li>QR payments are also happening a lot of rogue things.</li>
<li>The Chinese government gave a ‚Äúquit it‚Äù type of opinion when QR codes were a security hazard.</li>
<li>Alibaba ignored it.
<ul>
<li>The advantage of not listening to ‚Äúeveryone‚Äôs opinion</li>
<li>No company should operate based on everyone‚Äôs opinion.</li>
<li>What we all agree on is predictable.</li>
<li>Somehow, when it becomes widespread, it changes the world.‚Äù</li>
<li>I thought there was a man in the Chinese government who would not allow Alipay.</li>

<li>Before Alibaba, it cost $40,000 to lend money one time; you have to lend about 20 million to recoup your costs.
<ul>

</ul>
</li>
