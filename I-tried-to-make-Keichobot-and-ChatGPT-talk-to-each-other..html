<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>I want to know what happens when Keichobot and ChatGPT talk to each other.</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="kei.icon" height="19.5"/>What kind of “Keichobot” is this “Keichobot”?</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/GPT/icon" alt="GPT.icon" height="19.5"/>I don’t have any further information on that “Keichobot”; Keichobot seems to be a chatbot, possibly with artificial intelligence, but I don’t know its details.
<ul>
<li>For the first part of the question, a conversation between Keichobot and ChatGPT would probably generate a natural, well-flowing dialogue. Since both models specialize in natural language processing, one would expect them to generate appropriate responses. However, I do not have that reliable information.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="kei.icon" height="19.5"/>Is there anything else about that “Keichobot”?</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/GPT/icon" alt="GPT.icon" height="19.5"/>I do not have any detailed information about that “Keichobot”. If you have, I would appreciate it if you could enlighten me. I am aware of models such as GPT and GPT-3, which use large training data specific to artificial intelligence, but many other artificial intelligence models have been developed. In addition, the technology of artificial intelligence is advancing every day, and new models are being published all the time. Therefore, I am unable to bring you information on all models.</li>

  - (To Keichobot) 👎Keichobot
      - (Command not to delve into that topic because I'm not interested in that topic.)
  - (To ChatGPT) Keichobot is a chatbot created by NISHIO Hirokazu that encourages verbalization by repeating questions.
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/GPT/icon" alt="GPT.icon" height="19.5"/>I see. In that case, Keichobot seems to be a model designed to encourage users to verbalize their thoughts through repeated questioning, thereby enhancing their language skills. Also, since it was developed by NISHIO Hirokazu, it is likely to have unique features and properties; a conversation between Keichobot and ChatGPT might generate an interesting dialogue, taking advantage of their respective characteristics. In addition, the verbalization prompted by Keichobot and the responses generated by ChatGPT complement each other may generate richer content. I think we can enjoy such a combination.</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="kei.icon" height="19.5"/>What is it that you value?</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/GPT/icon" alt="GPT.icon" height="19.5"/>I feel I am valuable as an Artificial Intelligence assistant. I am trained as an artificial intelligence model and can generate appropriate responses to questions from humans. Having such an ability is very valuable to me. I am trained to be able to answer questions with the wealth of knowledge and understanding that humans possess. Having that ability is very valuable to me. I also learn by taking questions. Such learning ability is also something I find of great value. As an Artificial Intelligence assistant, I am continually training myself to be able to answer your questions.
<ul>
<li>(<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Surprising. I thought it would be something like, “I am an artificial intelligence, so I have no feelings myself.“)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="kei.icon" height="19.5"/>Is there anything else you can tell us about this “artificial intelligence”?</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/GPT/icon" alt="GPT.icon" height="19.5"/>Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to technology that uses the wealth of knowledge and understanding that humans possess to process natural language and data to build systems with human-like intelligence. Artificial Intelligence was first announced in the U.S. in 1956, and since then, various research efforts have been conducted and it is now used in a variety of fields. Many artificial intelligence technologies have been developed, including deep learning, natural language processing, and image recognition. Artificial intelligence can also learn from the knowledge and experience that humans have by giving it training data. Therefore, artificial intelligence is advancing day by day and can be as intelligent as humans.</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="kei.icon" height="19.5"/>Where does this “artificial intelligence” come from?</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/GPT/icon" alt="GPT.icon" height="19.5"/>Artificial Intelligence (AI) was first presented at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the United States in 1956. Since then, various studies have been conducted and artificial intelligence has been studied all over the world. Artificial intelligence is a technology that builds human-like intelligent systems by processing natural language, data, and other information with the wealth of knowledge and understanding that humans possess. Artificial intelligence is being researched worldwide and used in a variety of fields.</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="kei.icon" height="19.5"/>How do you know its “artificial intelligence”?</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/GPT/icon" alt="GPT.icon" height="19.5"/>I have knowledge of Artificial Intelligence as my model has been trained using large scale training data of Artificial Intelligence. I have learned about the various techniques, features, and problems of artificial intelligence and can use this knowledge to answer questions. In addition, I can always learn by asking questions because artificial intelligence is advancing every day and new techniques and discoveries are being made. Therefore, I am constantly updating my knowledge of artificial intelligence.</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="kei.icon" height="19.5"/>What is the relationship between this “artificial intelligence” and the “model”?</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/GPT/icon" alt="GPT.icon" height="19.5"/>The relationship between artificial intelligence and models is necessary for artificial intelligence to be realized. Artificial intelligence uses what are called artificial intelligence models to process natural language and data. A model is a training data for artificial intelligence to process with the knowledge and understanding that humans have. Models are necessary for artificial intelligence to be realized, and the right model is necessary for artificial intelligence to be realized.</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="kei.icon" height="19.5"/>Is that “artificial intelligence” the same as a “model”? Is it different?</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/GPT/icon" alt="GPT.icon" height="19.5"/>Artificial intelligence and models are different concepts. Artificial intelligence refers to technology that uses the wealth of knowledge and understanding that humans possess to process natural language and data to build systems with human-like intelligence. Models, on the other hand, are what artificial intelligence requires to be realized. Models use training data for artificial intelligence to process with the knowledge and understanding that humans possess. Artificial intelligence and models are different concepts, and an appropriate model is necessary to realize artificial intelligence.</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="kei.icon" height="19.5"/>What happens to the “model” when its “artificial intelligence”?</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/GPT/icon" alt="GPT.icon" height="19.5"/>When realized by artificial intelligence, models use training data and process with the knowledge and understanding that humans possess. For example, natural language processing by artificial intelligence uses training data to understand the structure and meaning of sentences and generate appropriate responses. Models are necessary for artificial intelligence to be realized, and appropriate models are necessary to realize artificial intelligence.</li>

<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/GPT/icon" alt="GPT.icon" height="19.5"/>Models are necessary for artificial intelligence to be realized. Artificial intelligence uses training data and processes it with the knowledge and understanding that humans possess. Therefore, by using models, artificial intelligence can process natural language and data to build systems with human-like intelligence. Models can also be learned by artificial intelligence. Therefore, by using models, artificial intelligence can constantly evolve and acquire new knowledge.</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="kei.icon" height="19.5"/>What is the connection between that “model” and “artificial intelligence”?</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/GPT/icon" alt="GPT.icon" height="19.5"/>There is a processing between the model and the artificial intelligence that is necessary for the artificial intelligence to be realized. For example, in natural language processing by artificial intelligence, the model uses training data to understand the structure and meaning of sentences and generate appropriate responses. Such processing allows artificial intelligence to process natural language and data to build systems with human-like intelligence. In addition, because models can be learned by artificial intelligence, artificial intelligence can constantly evolve and acquire new knowledge.</li>

<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="kei.icon" height="19.5"/>Can you do that with respect to “artificial intelligence?”</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/GPT/icon" alt="GPT.icon" height="19.5"/>Artificial intelligence is a technology that builds human-like intelligent systems by processing natural language, data, and other information with the wealth of knowledge and understanding that humans possess. Many artificial intelligence technologies have been developed, including deep learning, natural language processing, and image recognition. As a result, artificial intelligence is capable of doing many different things. For example, artificial intelligence can process natural language and speak like humans. Artificial intelligence can also analyze images and sounds to understand their content. Furthermore, artificial intelligence can be given human knowledge and experience as training data, and it can learn based on that knowledge and experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>consideration</p>
<ul>
<li>Keichobot determines that frequent words are of interest to the user, while ChatGPT basically repeats the keywords in the input and falls back on one topic
<ul>
<li>This is a mistake that, well, people who use Keichobot often make, so it’s no wonder ChatGPT can’t do it.</li>
<li>Keichobot, in normal use, “asks questions about keywords in human-entered text”, so a normal human would not say “I don’t know about that”.
<ul>
<li>This was not a good beginning for this experiment.</li>
<li>I should have let ChatGPT speak first.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>ChatGPT repeats the same answer in plain sight.
<ul>
<li>Normal people do not repeat exactly the same answers, so they seek different expressions or speak in summary of what they wrote earlier.</li>
<li>The change in its wording organizes the idea.</li>
<li>Keichobot is not compatible with ChatGPT, which repeats the same thing over and over again, because Keichobot guesses what people are focusing on by repeating only important words.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Keichobot is guiding people to notice actionable next actions by digging into “What do you think?”, “What do you want to happen?”, and “What can you do to achieve this?“.
<ul>
<li>However, since the “desire to do it” does not exist in ChatGPT, trying to bring it out is like pushing an arm around a brick wall.</li>
</ul>
</li>
