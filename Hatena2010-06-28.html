*1277728374*Python Hot Springs 2010-06 Diary
This time, I did not take Friday off, so I headed directly to Atami after work.

>>
I will try my best to earn the difference of 2,000 yen in one hour on the Shinkansen. Commit Now.
&lt;&lt;

I like working on the bullet train. It makes me feel more productive. I thought about living in Atami and commuting by Shinkansen, but I was told that there is a limit to the amount of money that can be paid for transportation.

We were told to save dinner until around 9:00 p.m., so we took the Kodak to Atami at 8:45 a.m. and arrived at the ryokan at 9:05 a.m. by cab, but it was already cleaned up, bam!

>>
#pyspa I brought today: iPad app with Python source code global (self-made), PONG app with iPad figure on it (self-made), iPad app to support speed reading (under development).
&lt;&lt;

Demonstration of Muroto: 270MB and 30,000 HTML files on an iPad.

>>
By the way, the app I just showed you to view Python source code on iPad contains 270MB of 3000 files created by global. I'm thinking of deleting it now that I'm done showing it to you. I put 270MB in the area to be synchronized, so it takes a long time to synchronize and I have to cancel it every time.
&lt;&lt;

>>
JS to one decimal place is (1/3).toFixed(1)
&lt;&lt;

>>
IBAction is used with &quot;- (IBAction)changeGreeting:(id)sender;&quot;.
&lt;&lt;

Develop a speed-reading support application on the iPad.

>>
Now looking into how to change the title of alert in JS -> can't change the title of alert? ->Changed policy to do alert-like with jQuery.
&lt;&lt;

Go to bed, wake up at 8:00 a.m. Eats dinner. Doze off in the chair for about 2 hours. Wake up.

>>
@voluntas You made it rain again!
&lt;&lt;

>>
The speed-reading application is ready. Now I just need to add a few presets of sentences to select from, or add my own favorite sentences to speed-read. But I'm going to leave that aside and work on Sphinx.
&lt;&lt;

>>
After easy-install sphinx, I'm looking around for sphinx-qickstart -> /opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/bin/ is not in the path. The conclusion is that the problem is that the path to
&lt;&lt;

>>
Please indicate if you want to use one of the following Sphinx extensions:> autodoc: automatically insert docstrings from modules (y/N):→

Heh! > coverage: checks for documentation coverage (y/N) [n]:→

Oh, there it is> viewcode: include links to the source code of documented Python objects→

http://sphinx.pocoo.org/markup/code.html →

Well, what do we do now? When the technical problems are solved and all we have to do is do it, I'm less motivated. →

It's a bit of a muddy process, but I've got about an hour left until dinner anyway, so I thought I'd try automating it.

In the meantime, I have a Python reST on hand that I dropped from svn, so let's make this with Sphinx on hand.
&lt;&lt;

>>
I have to buy Expert Python! →
I've heard interesting things about the Gabecolle book.
&lt;&lt;

>>
After deleting *.rst from the source in Sphinx, toc = self.tocs[docname].deepcopy() now throws a KeyError.
I deleted build/toctree and it's fine now ->.
You can do searches like this offline: http://gyazo.com/1971dc6b93f55bbe253a7f15cc8d8c46.png
&lt;&lt;

Take a bath.

>>
I'll do the iPad source code reader on the train to work with a list of small, fragmented tasks that need to be done to complete it. I was thinking Python source code, but jane street core might be a good idea. →.
The iPad speed reading support app needs to figure out how to add more presets and a mechanism that allows users to freely add content. Thinking in the bath? →.
I'm supposed to study git, C(++) and OCaml ->.
This is my first time using gist, and it is very useful. I had thought it was something for github users and hadn't checked it out, but it turns out it's a service that allows you to easily paste source code from your browser, add syntax highlighting, and publish it. I didn't know that.
&lt;&lt;

I've been having a night chat because I'm losing my concentration. I'm not sure if I'll be able to find the name of the company in Google, but Yahoo seems to be able to do it. I'm not sure if I'll be able to do it on Yahoo.

&lt;&lt;
Muna seems to mean something like &quot;I have no choice&quot;. I don't know about &quot;訝異,&quot; but &quot;いぶかしむ&quot; is a Chinese character.

>>
The only reason I'm not more productive must be because I'm sleepy.

Before going to bed, I remembered that I hadn't done so yet and tried to eatdogfood the speed-reading support tool I had created. Reading an English text in a situation where I couldn't physically turn the page and the progress bar was rushing me is still a feeling I've never experienced before. My WPM was 157.3.

There are a lot of features I'd like to add, like the ability to change the text to read, but I may just submitt it this week. Maybe I'm patronizing the author, but I think this is interesting.
&lt;&lt;

We return to Akihabara while listening to what is going on.

He told us to be alert to what is needed in the company, find something that you can solve, solve it, and then go out and sell it to the people who need it.
This is when I look at me personally as a company and the company I work for as a customer who buys my company's labor and deliverables and pays me for them,
It's just like marketing to uncover potential customer needs, develop products that can answer those needs, and then take those products to the right person who will create the appropriate value to make the sale. It is so obvious. Why didn't we notice this before? Developing products without considering the needs of the customers and storing them in a warehouse without marketing them is not going to work, is it?

I'm talking about taking inventory of your skills.

The story is that you should try ERP because you lack the ability to manage resources.

We arrived at Akihabara and disbanded, but it seemed that the Unexplored Youth Project debriefing session, which I thought had already ended, was not over yet, so I went to join them. I joined the group and found that everything was over and the critiques were done, and the developers were taking a commemorative photo.


>>
I'm at Marz in Akihabara.
I was thinking of buying that one if I ever get a chance to come to Akiba, but I forgot what it was. →.
It was a perthier element! RT @nakamura001: From what nishio-san is doing now, is it a conductive sponge or something else? →@nakamura001: Yes, I think so.
Then they told me to buy a power supply to carry 5 amps of current, which cost me more money than I had planned. →.
Oh no, I have to withdraw money tomorrow morning or I won't have any cash! But it was okay because I collected the money for dinner and paid by credit card.
&lt;&lt;

So I was out and about from the time I left home on Friday morning all the way until Sunday night. Moo, my room is a mess. Mail is all over the place.
&lt;/body>
