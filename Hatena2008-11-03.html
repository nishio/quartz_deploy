*1225658010* Affiliates
If I use Amazon EC2 for a server to run Saichuji2 (with battle function &amp; AI written in C++ or Haskell), it will cost me about $73 per month on an ongoing basis. I was wondering what to do about it, but then I was told, &quot;Why don't you just put up ads and collect the money? That's right, if I create a service that earns more than $73/month, I don't have to think about the server cost.

So I tried to create a Google AdSense account, but...it comes by check? That's a hassle. So I changed my target to a Japanese company. Also, I'm going to put it here because this blog has more page views than the game in the middle of the day.


&lt;a href='http://www.valuecommerce.ne.jp/'>Value Commerce&lt;/a>, It was my fault too for mistaking my e-mail address when I registered, but I'm having trouble registering with the same URL even though there should have been an error. It seems that the URL is not normalized, so I removed the trailing slash and it went through. But for some reason, it also asks me to enter the title of the site, so I'm getting conflicts there too. I wonder if it's a specification that sites with the same title can't be registered. I wonder how it works.


&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.j-a-net.jp/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>JANet&lt;/a>&lt;img src=&quot;http://text.j-a-net.jp/1050611/1040/&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; border=&quot;0 The &quot;JANet&quot; is a service that handles money, but it has a ridiculous specification that the password must be alphanumeric and up to 10 characters. Well, the explanation may have been the most helpful. I was surprised that the input form has voice guidance, though.


&lt;a href=&quot;http://click.j-a-net.jp/1050611/240440/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>Smart-C&lt;img src=&quot;http://text.j-a-net.jp/1050611/240440/&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;>&lt;/a>. Is this for a mobile site? I know this blog can be viewed from a cell phone, but I wonder if it's worth putting it here.


And this kind of thing is supposed to be checked by a human to see if it's okay as an ad serving medium. I've gone so far as to create an account in a late-night fling, but for now, I guess I'll just have to wait, since no one inside is working at this late hour of the night. I have a feeling I'll be bored by the time it gets approved.


Since I'm here, I'll post the link, though it's flying. &lt;a href=&quot;http://click.j-a-net.jp/1050611/11675/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>Finally, zero yen commission! FX Prime&lt;img src=&quot;http://text.j-a-net.jp/1050611/11675/&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;>&lt;/a>, &lt;a href=&quot;http://click.j-a-net.jp/ 1050611/11676/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>FX from 10,000 yen. FX Prime &quot;Selectable Gaika&quot; &lt;img src=&quot;http://text.j-a-net.jp/1050611/11676/&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; border=&quot;0 &quot;>&lt;/a>. I don't know if this is the first time in Japan to offer zero yen commission. At any rate, they are offering 2000 yen cash back campaign until the end of December.

*1225664339* noticed
I was surprised to see so many affiliates offering a few yen per click, but when I think about it calmly, even if I posted one such link every day and 30 people clicked on it every day, it would still be 900 yen per month. Some of them pay 3 yen or so, but that's a minority. I'm starting to feel barren already.

Oh, but I think it might be helpful in the future to see the number of times each link is displayed and clicked on, so I'll keep doing that for a while.

*1225703557*Affiliate of the person OK type
I want to experience it myself and then blog about it, but the dilemma is that I have to experience it after stepping on the link I wrote about it. w
I'll just post the link for now and edit it later.

And then I stopped halfway through because it was too much trouble to get a Blu-ray disc player when I didn't have a TV in the first place (oh).

**1225705283*Clione breeding
I was quite surprised to read a description of an interior aquarium called &lt;a href=&quot;http://click.j-a-net.jp/1050611/259085/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>Curio&lt;img src=&quot;http://text.j-a-net.jp/1050611/259085/&quot; height =&quot;1&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;>&lt;/a>, which was quite surprising when I read the description of the interior aquarium.
When I saw the phrases &quot;keeping clione&quot; and &quot;interior aquarium,&quot; I thought it was a clione version of the common interior aquarium with fake jellyfish in it, but it was not at all.

>>
The water temperature is always fixed at 3°C when the indoor temperature is 28°C or lower by CPU control. The water supply and drainage integrated filtration system (our patented structure) generates convection currents that allow cliones to spend their time stress-free, reproducing the Sea of Okhotsk under the ice floes where cliones live.
&lt;&lt;

Because! They say you can seriously keep clione at home. The FAQ is quite interesting. The FAQs are quite interesting: clione larvae are bud-shaped, they don't have wings yet, so they move around with cilia, and clione are hermaphrodites. I wonder if we can also observe predation scenes.

-----

PS: I was afraid that the price might be unaffordable, like 200,000 yen, but when I looked at the price, I saw that the monthly rental fee is 6,000 yen for a year or longer rental. I thought the price would be out of my reach, but then I looked at the price and saw that the monthly rental fee for a year or longer is 6,000 yen. I'm not wrong by one digit.... Is it possible to do it that cheaply?

*1225714463*Sleepy
I woke up at 2pm and I'm already sleepy...

The result of today's affiliate activity was 326 yen. I think I can raise the cost of AmazonEC2 for now. I'm going to release the prototype on Google App Engine as far as I can, test and develop the parts that can't be done on GAE on a VM at hand, and release it on EC2 when it's done.


The biggest problem is that I can't write any code at all. I have to figure out how to live if I can't write code forever.
