<li>In the previous note, we noted that one of the challenges of vector searches is that the same content is repeatedly hit, and pointed out the need for an implementation that tracks “what I have read in the past”. However, we also raised the question of the significance of re-reading something once read. This led to the introduction of overwrite mode and multi-heading, and a transition to an approach that creates a new page for each context. The system stores the “title of the page used” in JSON format and refers to the titles of previous outputs in turn.</li>
<li>Nishio’s discussion of “Need Bigger Sticky Notes” explores in depth the fixed nature of sticky note size and font size, as well as the relationship between content volume and size. In addition, “Supporting the Discovery of Connections” discusses the perspective of how specific features of Scrapbox can be used to support the discovery of connections in different contexts.</li>
<li>Deep thoughts and questions:
<ul>
<li>How often should the same content be reread and what is the significance of this?</li>
<li>How do the considerations Nishio points out regarding sticky note size and font size affect the intellectual production process?</li>
<li>How can specific features of Scrapbox be applied to support relevance discovery in different contexts?</li>
<li>In other notes by Nishio, he describes the use of Notion’s refinement capabilities, suggests the use of Scrapbox to build knowledge networks, and attempts to discover new relationships among existing knowledge networks. These are helpful as different approaches to effectively manage and integrate information and knowledge.</li>

<p>In our previous study, we pointed out that one of the problems with vector searches is that the same thing is repeatedly hit. To solve this problem, we thought it necessary to implement a system that remembers “what you have read in the past. However, we also wondered, “Do we really need to read something once and never read it again?” was also a question. Later, overwrite mode and multi-heading were implemented, and the idea was changed to just create a new page if the context was different. This changed the read management from the scope of the project to the scope of the page. Currently, the “title of the page used” is in JSON format to read the titles of all previous outputs.</p>
<p>In organizing Nishio’s research note fragment “Need for large sticky notes,” he discussed fixed sticky note size and font size, as well as changes in size based on the amount of content. Also, in “Supporting the Discovery of Connections,” he presented the idea that Scrapbox’s “Supporting the Discovery of Connections” feature could be applied to support the discovery of connections between different contents. These considerations are relevant to my research and will be useful for future research.</p>

<p>In our previous study, we pointed out that one of the problems with vector searches is that the same thing is repeatedly hit. To solve this problem, we thought it necessary to implement a system that remembers “what you have read in the past. However, we also wondered, “Do we really need to read something once and never read it again?” was also a question. Later, overwrite mode and multi-heading were implemented, and the idea was changed to just create a new page if the context was different. This changed the read management from the scope of the project to the scope of the page. Currently, the “title of the page used” is in JSON format to read the titles of all previous outputs.</p>
<p>In organizing Nishio’s research note fragment “Need for large sticky notes,” he discussed fixed sticky note size and font size, as well as changes in size based on the amount of content.

Also, in “Supporting the Discovery of Connections,” he presented the idea that Scrapbox’s “Supporting the Discovery of Connections” feature could be applied to support the discovery of connections between different contents. These considerations are relevant to my research and will be useful for future research.</p>

<li>“Do we really need to read something once and never again?” How often should we read the same thing about the question, “How often should we read the same thing?</li>
<li>Regarding Nishio’s fixation on sticky note size and font size in organizing “I need bigger stickies”, how do these affect intellectual production?</li>
<li>Is it possible to apply Scrapbox’s “connection discovery support” feature to support the discovery of connections between different contents? What methods are needed for this?</li>

<li>The problem is that naive implementation is where you read the same thing over and over again.</li>
<li>Need an implementation that remembers “what you’ve read in the past” and leaves it out.</li>
<li>On the other hand, “Do I really have to read something once and never again?” I mean, well, that’s not true.

<li>it’s all right</li>
<li>When I wrote this, it was a single head design.
<ul>
<li>It was assumed that the general branch would be used forever.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Then the overwrite mode was created, and today <a href="./multi-head" class="internal" data-slug="multi-head">multi-head</a> is implemented
<ul>
<li>Keep using one page, and you can always create different pages for different topics.</li>
<li>If this happens, why not just create a new page if the context is different? If this happens, why don’t we just create a new page if the context is different?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This means that read management was initially the scope of the project, but is now the scope of the page.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Right now the “title of the page used” is formatted for human reading, but we can put it in JSON format for machine reading and read all the titles of the past output.</li>
