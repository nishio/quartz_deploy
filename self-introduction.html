<li>(<a href="./pluralitybook" class="internal" data-slug="pluralitybook">pluralitybook</a>) Hello everyone! My name is NISHIO Hirokazu. I serve as a researcher at Cybozu, a company creating software that enhance teamwork. Additionally, I am a board member of the Mitou Foundation, where we support ambitious student IT projects in Japan.
<ul>
<li>One of my contributions was translating the keynote speech for Plurality Tokyo, delivered by Audrey Tang, into Japanese. I‚Äôm interested in ‚Äúbroad listening‚Äù ‚Äì I feel it as a form of human augmentation that paves the way for improved mutual-understanding and decision-making at all levels (national, communal, or organizational.)</li>
<li>I feel this translation project is an opportunity to bridge gaps and foster mutual understanding across linguistic boundaries. This sentiment aligns with the ‚ÄúPLURAL THINKING‚Äù concept articulated in ‚ÄúWHY I AM A PLURALIST‚Äù by Glen Weyl(2022)</li>
</ul>

<li>(to <a href="./mashbean" class="internal" data-slug="mashbean">mashbean</a>) I‚Äôm a researcher in Cybozu, whose philosophy is ‚Äú<a href="./Creating-a-fulfilling-society-of-group-cooperation" class="internal alias" data-slug="Creating-a-fulfilling-society-of-group-cooperation">Creating a fulfilling society of group cooperation</a>‚Äù.
<ul>
<li>Taka invited me to Plurality Tokyo last year, where I first learned about Plurality. I believe Plurality is an important concept, so I‚Äôm working on a Japanese translation project for it.</li>
