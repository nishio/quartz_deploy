<p>Knowledge that is both noteworthy and easy to acquire is not a <a href="./barrier-to-entry" class="internal alias" data-slug="barrier-to-entry">barrier to entry</a>, so acquiring it will not give you a competitive advantage.</p>

This tendency is especially noticeable among those who vociferously seek cost-effectiveness in the acquisition of knowledge and skills.
