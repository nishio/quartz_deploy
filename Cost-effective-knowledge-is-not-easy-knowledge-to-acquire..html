<p>Knowledge that is both noteworthy and easy to acquire is not a <a href="./barrier-to-entry" class="internal alias" data-slug="barrier-to-entry">barrier to entry</a>, so acquiring it will not give you a competitive advantage.</p>

This tendency is especially noticeable among those who vociferously seek cost-effectiveness in the acquisition of knowledge and skills. I’m not saying that it’s wrong to seek cosiness, but the knowledge and skills that are cosy to acquire are, on the other hand, things that many people do, and I don’t think it makes any difference if you do just that.</p>

I also think it’s a mistake. If you use knowledge and skills to make a living, the time and money you invest in them is an “investment”. If you are going to live by using your intelligence and skills, perhaps “cosy” is not the right way to go, but “able to increase ROI” is.</p>

I feel that the key is to be able to distinguish between the worlds expressed in “good cost performance” and “large ROI”. I feel that the key is to be able to distinguish the difference between the worlds expressed in “cost-effective~” and “large ROI~”, and while both are true when it comes to ROI, the former seems to focus mainly on “minimizing the investment amount”, while the important thing is “using up the money” afterwards.</p>

However, when it comes to “making a delicious dish at a cooking class” or “making a delicious dish with current ingredients”, it is necessary to think like the ROI mentioned earlier (overuse), right? Isn’t it the latter that is the goal or what is actually needed?　I think the latter is what is actually needed.</p>

The training provider sets the knowledge and skills that are expected to be acquired, but how to use them? The participants are then left to decide what to do with the knowledge and skills they have acquired. Whether the time and money invested is an investment or a cost depends on how the knowledge and skills are used. The decision of whether the time and money invested will be an investment or a cost is determined by the participants’ own plans for how they will use their knowledge and skills.</p>
