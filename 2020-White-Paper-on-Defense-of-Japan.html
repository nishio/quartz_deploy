<ul>
<li>Continuously increasing defense spending at a high level without transparency, with the goal of making China‚Äôs military a ‚Äúworld-class military‚Äù by the middle of the 21st century. Extensively and rapidly strengthening the quality and quantity of its military power, particularly its nuclear and missile capabilities and maritime and air power. In doing so, emphasis is also placed on strengthening operational capabilities to ensure information superiority, as well as capabilities related to the space, cyber, and electromagnetic domains</li>
<li>These enhancements will lead to the building of an ‚ÄúA2/AD‚Äù (Approach Detention/Area Denial) capability and the ability to conduct operations at greater distances.</li>
<li>Fully promote a policy of military-civilian fusion that aims to combine military and civilian resources in various fields, and actively promote the development and acquisition of advanced technologies that can be used by the military and the improvement of operational execution capabilities</li>
<li>Regarding global military trends, the report states that ‚Äúintelligent warfare is taking shape for the first time,‚Äù and that the military‚Äôs use of artificial intelligence and other initiatives</li>
</ul>
<p>Space domain P.169</p>
<ul>
<li>Major countries are upgrading the capabilities and launching various satellites to enhance C4ISR capabilities, etc.</li>
<li>Countries promote the use of space to maintain their own peace and security in space. In addition, China and Russia have indicated that they are strengthening their ability to interfere with the use of space by the U.S. and its allies</li>
<li>In response to these threats, countries are reorganizing their military space organizations
Cyber domain P.174</li>
<li>As militaries become increasingly reliant on information and communications networks, many foreign militaries recognize cyberattacks as an asymmetric means of attack that can disrupt enemy military operations at low cost and are developing offensive capabilities in cyberspace.</li>
<li>China and Russia indicated that they are strengthening their cyber attack capabilities as militaries to disrupt other countries‚Äô networked forces and destroy infrastructure.</li>
<li>Cyber-attacks against information and communication networks of not only government agencies and military forces but also private companies and academic institutions in other countries are frequent. Critical technology, confidential information, and personal information have been targeted in some cases.
Electromagnetic wave area P.180</li>
<li>Securing the use of electromagnetic waves is essential for the operation of communications and radar equipment. Major countries recognize that jamming the use of electromagnetic waves (electronic attack) is an asymmetric means of attack that effectively prevents the enemy from demonstrating its capabilities</li>
<li>China conducts regular training in the form of counter-measures to ensure effective mission execution in complex electromagnetic environments, improving real-world capabilities.</li>
<li>Russia has been using multiple electronic warfare equipment in eastern Ukraine and Syria to improve its electronic warfare capabilities, including jamming the command and control and radar of its opponents, according to the report.
New coronavirus infection p. 183</li>
<li>The challenges posed by the new coronavirus infection are not limited to mere sanitation issues, but also affect the overall socioeconomics of each country, including supply chain vulnerabilities and the severe impact on local economies, leading to fears of a prolonged global economic slowdown.</li>
<li>Each country is making efforts to cope with the disease in their own countries by utilizing their military‚Äôs sanitary functions and transportation capabilities, as well as contributing to the prevention of the international spread of the disease. On the other hand, the military activities of each country have been affected and restricted in various ways, such as the cancellation or postponement of drills and joint exercises. If the spread of the disease continues for an extended period of time, it could have a variety of effects on the military posture of each country.
China and other countries are actively dispatching medical experts and providing medical supplies to countries where the infection is spreading, and it has been pointed out that they are also engaged in various propaganda efforts, including the spread of false information, triggered by the social unrest and confusion that has accompanied the spread of the infection.</li>
</ul>
<p>P.41</p>
<blockquote>
<p>National competition is a regular occurrence through a variety of means, including the use of military and law enforcement agencies to threaten the sovereignty of other countries and the use of social networks to manipulate public opinion in other countries.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What are ‚Äúgray zone situation‚Äù and ‚Äúhybrid warfare‚Äù?
The so-called ‚Äúgray zone situation‚Äù is a straightforward description of a wide range of situations that are neither purely peacetime nor contingency.
For example, a situation in which two nations have conflicting claims to territory, sovereignty, and economic rights and interests, including those of the sea, and at least one party attempts to change the status quo and force acceptance of its own claims and demands by, for example, frequently demonstrating its presence in the area in question using forceful organizations, etc., to the extent that such actions do not constitute armed aggression. This is a situation in which at least one party attempts to change the status quo by using forceful organizations, etc. to demonstrate a frequent presence in the area in question and to force acceptance of its claims and demands.
So-called ‚Äúhybrid warfare‚Äù is a method of changing the status quo that intentionally blurs the boundary between military and non-military, and such a method forces the other side to deal with complexities that go beyond the military aspect.
For example, we believe that methods using a combination of influence operations such as operations using unknown units with concealed nationalities, sabotage of communications and critical infrastructure through cyber attacks, and dissemination of false information via the Internet and media fall under the category of ‚Äúhybrid warfare‚Äù. It has been pointed out that these methods are intended to delay the military‚Äôs initial response and make it difficult for the other side to respond, as well as to deny the country‚Äôs involvement by taking measures that are not clearly recognized as the ‚Äúuse of force‚Äù in appearance.
As part of the emerging competition among nations, gray zone situations tend to persist for a long period of time through various means, including ‚Äúhybrid warfare‚Äù.
In particular, Japan has a policy of ‚Äúexclusive defense‚Äù in which the minimum necessary defense force is used only in the event of the ‚Äúuse of force,‚Äù making it difficult to move against something that is ambiguous as to whether it is the use of force or not.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the National Defense White Paper ‚ÄúChina‚Äôs National Defense in the New Era‚Äù published in July 2037, it is stated that ‚Äúintelligent (computerization) warfare is appearing for the first time‚Äù in terms of global military trends, and the Chinese military‚Äôs efforts to utilize artificial intelligence (AI) are attracting attention. Chinese military‚Äôs efforts to utilize artificial intelligence (AI), for example, are drawing attention.</p>

<p>What is <a href="./military-civilian-fusion" class="internal alias" data-slug="military-civilian-fusion">military-civilian fusion</a>?
The integration of the military and civilian sectors is an initiative that China has been promoting as a national strategy in recent years. In addition to the conventional defense mobilization system designed for emergency situations, it is said to promote the military use of civilian resources and the conversion of military technology to civilian use on a regular basis, not limited to emergency situations.
In particular, efforts in what are considered ‚Äúemerging areas‚Äù for China, such as maritime, space, cyber, and artificial intelligence (AI), have been identified as priority areas for military-private sector integration.</p>
