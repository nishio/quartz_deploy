<blockquote>
<p>When I can’t make progress on a manuscript, I write it on Twitter and then organize it, a phenomenon that I think is not essential whether it is on Twitter or not, so I try to do it on Fedibird.
Maybe the essence of it is “that you can focus only on writing anew, not taking energy to rewrite by not being able to change what you’ve written and sent.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve written so far.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: You say I can change the front of the KJ Law at any time, but when in the world do I change it?
A: I think some people want this question explained by “feelings” and others by “logic”.
“Feelings” are easier to explain. Just do it “when you feel like doing it.” When you are enjoying your work and think, “This is not good enough,” you can “change it <a href="./to-something-you-think-is-good" class="internal alias" data-slug="to-something-you-think-is-good">to something you think is good</a>. Then you can keep the fun alive. Keeping the fun alive is important.”
Those who want an explanation with “logic” will find the above explanation “fluffy”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A few key words are floating around, metacognition, process productivity,…</p>
<p>Since it is a method to support intellectual production, the most important part is not the branches and leaves of “what exactly to do,” but “it is a method to support intellectual production.</p>
<p>In other words, the most important objective is to “create a state of high intellectual productivity</p>
<p>Intellectual productivity is the value of the final product per input cost, but there is a large time delay before this becomes apparent, so it cannot be used to make decisions</p>
<p>So let’s focus on the productivity of the process. Let’s limit our discussion to ideas. Ideas are a resource that can be replicated, so producing the same idea that already exists is of little value.</p>
<p>Ideas you are not enthusiastic about are also of little value. An idea is valuable only after it has been created, nurtured, and refined with a great deal of effort. If you, the first person involved in the idea, are not willing to put in the effort, the probability that others will be willing to do so is low, and as a result, the probability that the idea will have value is also low.</p>
<p>Those who express this principle sensitively express it as “awareness,” “excitement,” “fun!” and “fun!
The assumed readers of this text are probably less literate in sensible expression and more literate in logical expression.</p>
<p>There is a certain “good condition” that is pointed to by words such as this “awareness,” “excitement,” “fun,” or, more parenthetically, “zone,” “flow state,” and “subject-object union. It is important to create and continue these “good conditions.</p>
<p>This “good state” may in the future be objectively quantified quantitatively from, for example, EEG, fMRI or optical topography data.</p>
<p>However, currently we have to do without it because it is not yet readily available. This is like saying that today we have easy access to PCs and smartphones, so we can use them for intellectual production, but 50 years ago people did not, so they had to use pen and paper (I am writing this text on my smartphone while walking).</p>
<p>Fortunately, Homo sapiens seems to have the ability to recognize this “good state” without the use of sophisticated measuring instruments. The senses are first of all nonverbal. Just as one can taste the complex flavors and aromas of wine, but not necessarily be able to describe them in words.</p>
<p>By using it, they become proficient and better able to use it. People who disregard and do not use their nonverbal senses will be poor at using them to make judgments. A person who says to wine, “I don’t care what it tastes or smells like, as long as it’s cheap and has alcohol in it,” will never become a sommelier.</p>
<p>When will the nameplate be changed?
Bicycle metaphor. When you are pedaling a bicycle and you feel resistance in your legs or hear an unpleasant creaking sound, you feel that you are not in good shape.</p>
<p>I’m not in good shape, so I’m doing maintenance.</p>

<li>In the case of this page, “where needed” is a question and a direct answer to it.

<li>The parable of the newly produced wine from this activity “seems beneficial” but not necessarily “beneficial to the present purpose”.
<ul>
<li>There could be a conclusion to cut out separately.</li>
<li>This is an important point</li>
<li>The desire to keep newly created thing X because it seems useful in the future is different from whether X is useful for the purpose of the activity you are doing now.</li>

<li><img src="https://gyazo.com/e4deadb972f9c412942701910a31f516/thumb/1000" alt="image"/></li>
<li>We need to be able to “feel” and “recognize” this</li>
<li>What recognition is that?</li>

<ul>
<li>The process you are following</li>
<li>(at sentence-end, falling tone) indicates a confident conclusion</li>
<li>Things are turning out well now.”</li>
<li>It’s not running well right now.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This cognition is non-verbal

<li><img src="https://gyazo.com/22b705b1bb6d581a772f5eef75c1b020/thumb/1000" alt="image"/></li>
<li>So it’s easier to explain it in terms of feelings.</li>

<p>If you work for three hours and “come to the same conclusion as usual,” then those three hours of work are wasted and you should go see a trendy movie.</p>
<p>Even if you organize the information, create a beautiful report, and give it to your client company, and that is OK for the job, if the report fails to move anyone in the client company, if it fails to change anyone’s behavior, your report is not creating customer value. Your company alone is getting sales, but your clients are not getting value for their money, and society as a whole is not getting value.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is a little less well explained.</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of sensations</p>
<ul>
<li>On a cold winter morning, when you’re shivering and thinking about making a warm cup of coffee</li>
<li>When you’re up late on a holiday, reading an interesting novel in bed, and you’re about to turn off the sidelight when you stop reading the rest of the book.
You sense that your internal state is inadequate and are taking action to correct it
We can feel the same way about malfunctions in the process of intellectual productivity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s say feeling → sensation.</p>
