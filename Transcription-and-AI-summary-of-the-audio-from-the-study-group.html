<li>Impressions: Transcription processing time is 3.5 minutes, cost is 40 cents, can talk and dig deeper, and can extract just the questions. I personally find it highly useful to be able to extract the questions. A new intellectual production takes place, but the person is so absorbed in answering that he or she does not remember the content, and it takes several hours of re-listening to the video and converting the questions into text. I think I should always record in the future, or maybe I should excavate past recordings and process them as well.</li>

<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Please explain where you might answer the question.</p>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/Claude/icon" alt="Claude.icon" height="19.5"/>Yes, I will explain what I believe to be the answer to your question.</p>
<ul>
<li>In response to the question, ‚ÄúIt felt democratic without assumptions like there is no bias in cost allocation.‚Äù If money is spent, the value of a dollar may vary from person to person, but if the weight of a dollar is the same for everyone, then an individual will vote yes at half the overall cost of the buy-in. then it is justice. It would have that strong a utility.</li>
<li>In response to the question, ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt the purpose of quadratic baiting to eliminate commemorative votes?‚Äù In the Taiwan President Hackathon, 99 votes were distributed and the UI was designed to allow participants to vote for others with the extra votes, which is different from the original purpose of quadratic baiting.</li>
<li>In response to the question, ‚ÄúWill open source projects be a tragedy of the commons?‚Äù Open source code itself is not a tragedy of the commons in and of itself, since it can be replicated. Rather, the limited resources are the maintainers‚Äô review costs and time, and incentive design is important in this regard.</li>
<li>In response to the question, ‚ÄúWhy not provide a separate incentive to vote for multiple voting tokens?‚Äù, it might be a good idea to design such a UI through trial and error.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Is there anything else?</p>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/Claude/icon" alt="Claude.icon" height="19.5"/>Yes, there were answers to several other questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>In response to the question, ‚ÄúWhen do Quadratic Voting voters feel this way is better than regular voting?‚Äù the ability to express the strength of one‚Äôs opinion and the ability to vote for more than one option are cited as advantages. On the other hand, there may be people who do not like to use their brains to express the strength of their feelings, but such people can vote for all the options they think are the best as before.</li>
<li>In response to the question, ‚ÄúDoes quadratic baiting only let you vote with integers?‚Äù Theoretically, there is no such restriction, but that is the way the UI is set up for the Taiwan Presidential Hackathon.</li>
<li>In response to the question, ‚ÄúIf I hoard (voting tokens), won‚Äôt I always get my opinion?‚Äù That is correct, and that is not voting. If you go to vote because you don‚Äôt know who to choose, and if you hoard them because you don‚Äôt know who to vote for, then you have a new option.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are additional questions and answers, and it is clear that the speaker is trying to carefully answer the audience‚Äôs questions with real-life examples. Through the answers to the questions, the audience may have gained a better understanding of quadratic boating and Gov4Git.</p>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Is there anything else?</p>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/Claude/icon" alt="Claude.icon" height="19.5"/>There were no other explicit questions and answers, but speakers provided additional explanations throughout to facilitate participants‚Äô understanding. For example,</p>
<ul>
<li>Regarding the introduction of quadratic baiting into politics, he stated that it would be realistic to introduce it gradually, rather than replacing the current system entirely.</li>
<li>The scale of distribution of funds to open source projects by Gitcoin is clearly explained using Cybozu as an example.</li>
<li>He noted that through his experience with Gab4Git, he realized that there is an incentive for the community to make a beneficial contribution, suggesting the potential of the platform.</li>
<li>On the other hand, he also described the current status of Gab4Git as still in the ‚Äútutorial stage,‚Äù pointing out issues such as the fact that pull requests are determined by the administrator rather than the community, and that credits are issued at the discretion of the administrator rather than through quadratic funding.</li>
<li>Throughout the entire session, the lecturers check the participants‚Äô level of understanding as they talk, giving the impression that they are committed to interactive and two-way communication.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Elaborate on the exchange regarding ‚ÄúIs it not the purpose of quadratic baiting to eliminate commemorative votes?‚Äù</p>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/Claude/icon" alt="Claude.icon" height="19.5"/>Yes, I will elaborate on the exchange to the question from the chat, ‚ÄúIs it not the purpose of quadratic baiting to eliminate memorial votes?‚Äú.</p>
<p>First, as background to this question, when the SPEAKER introduced the case study of the Taiwan Presidential Hackathon, he explained that the UI was designed to distribute 99 votes and let the participants vote for other candidates with the extra votes. This led some participants to ask whether the purpose of quadratic baiting was to eliminate commemorative votes.</p>
<p>In response, the SPEAKER clarified that quadratic baiting itself is not intended to eliminate commemorative votes. He explained that the UI used in the Taiwan Presidential Hackathon to distribute 99 votes was intended to encourage participants to consider more candidates by allowing them to vote for other candidates with their extra votes, but this is not the original purpose of quadratic voting.</p>
<p>Speaker further adds that the original purpose of quadratic baiting is to allow voters to cast their votes based on their interests. He states that the main purpose of quadratic baiting is to focus votes on votes that are of interest, rather than on votes that are not truly of interest.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if 99 votes are distributed uniformly, as in the Taiwan Presidential Hackathon, there is an incentive for people to vote for candidates they are not originally interested in in an attempt to use up the extra votes. Although this may induce voting behavior that differs from the voter‚Äôs true intention, and is therefore incompatible with the philosophy of quadratic baiting, speakers found it an interesting experiment in UI design.</p>
<p>The above is a detailed explanation of the speaker‚Äôs response to the question, ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt the purpose of quadratic baiting to eliminate commemorative votes?‚Äù speaker accurately captured the questioner‚Äôs question and encouraged understanding by explaining the essential purpose of quadratic baiting, while the President of Taiwan made it clear that the hackathon case is only one of the applications. At the same time, he also gave certain credit to the aspect of UI design ingenuity, and we feel that the discussion was well-balanced.</p>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>What does ‚Äúmemorial vote‚Äù mean in this case?</p>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/Claude/icon" alt="Claude.icon" height="19.5"/>A ‚Äúmemorial vote‚Äù in this context can be interpreted as referring to a less important vote that is different from the original voter‚Äôs intent.</p>
<p>Specifically, in the case of the Taiwan Presidential Hackathon, 99 votes were distributed uniformly to participants, and the UI was designed to allow participants to vote for other candidates with their extra votes. This may cause participants to vote for candidates they have little interest in in order to ‚Äúuse up‚Äù their extra votes.</p>
<p>It is assumed that the term ‚Äúcommemorative vote‚Äù is used to describe such votes that do not reflect the true preferences of the voters and that would not normally be cast. From the word ‚Äúcommemorative,‚Äù one can read the connotation of a formal or ceremonial vote that deviates from its original purpose.</p>
<p>In response, the SPEAKER explained that the original purpose of quadratic baiting was to allocate votes based on the voter‚Äôs true interest. He stated that the main purpose of quadratic baiting is to avoid casting a vote on a ballot in which the voter is not truly interested.</p>
<p>Thus, ‚Äúmemorial votes‚Äù in this context can be understood to refer to votes that do not reflect the true intent of the voter, which quadratic baiting originally seeks to eliminate.</p>
<p>PS: ‚Äúmemorial vote‚Äù meant ‚Äúdeath vote‚Äù (I searched the transcription for ‚Äúmemorial vote‚Äù to confirm the relevant part).<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/></p>

<p>Q. I wonder if ‚Äúmoving hearts and minds‚Äù is for conventional democracy.
A. No. With Quadratic Voting, there is a greater incentive to increase the number of friends and to get more people to understand.</p>
<p>Q. Even if the cost is squared, won‚Äôt it be like Elon Musk buying it all up?
A. It‚Äôs just that it costs a square of the cost to buy it outright. If Elon Musk is willing to put out as much as he wants to do it, he must like it that much.</p>
<p>Q. It doesn‚Äôt feel democratic unless there is an assumption that there is no bias in cost allocation.
A. If money is spent, it is possible that the weight of a dollar may vary from person to person.</p>
<p>Q. If an individual wants to do it even at the cost of buying up all the goods, does that mean that it is the right thing to do from a social perspective?
A. The argument of Quadratic Voting is that if a person has such a strong utility, it is better to respect the will of the person who wants it so strongly than to crush the will of the minority with 99% of the majority.</p>
<p>Q. I‚Äôm starting to feel that we should have, for example, ‚Äú200 - age‚Äù as a voting right.
A. That is one approach, but there is a belief that a system in which the number of votes is determined by attributes would lead to a division by attribute, and Quadratic Voting‚Äôs strength is that it does not divide by attribute and allows you to change the weighting according to your interests.</p>
<p>Q. Is the QV independent of the talk about things like the death vote not decreasing?
A. With Quadratic Funding, every single person‚Äôs vote contributes to how much money is actually distributed, so there are no votes that are not reflected in the decision-making process, The proportional distribution is increased, so there is no such thing as a vote with zero value.</p>
<p>Q. When do you think QV voters would prefer this way of voting to the normal way of voting? than a regular vote?
A. The ability to express the strength of one‚Äôs opinion and to vote for multiple options are advantages. However, the 99-vote system is an interesting UI device that is rather different from the advantages of Quadratic Voting.</p>
<p>Q. You only let people vote in integer numbers.
A. There are no such restrictions at all, but that is just what we are doing for the Taiwan President‚Äôs Cup Hackathon.</p>
<p>Q. Why not provide a separate incentive to vote for more than one (e.g., give an additional cost allocation)?
A. I think it would be a good idea to design the UI in a variety of ways through trial and error.</p>
<p>Q. I think GitHub‚Äôs graphs/contributors visualizes contributions in a graph, but I‚Äôm not sure.
