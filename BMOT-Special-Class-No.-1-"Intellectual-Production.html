Supplemented by reviewing the video</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Talk about wanting to change preconceived notions of what a class is.</p>
<ul>
<li>What do you associate with the word ‚Äúclass?‚Äù ‚ÄúThe teacher talks in front of the class and the students take notes.‚Äù ‚ÄúI see.</li>
<li>Recently, I‚Äôve been auditing a class by Dr. Shiozawa at Seikei University.
<ul>
<li>‚ÄúThe class is physical education.‚Äù</li>
<li>A place where knowledge is conveyed in a one-way manner is not good. A class where people think and discuss together = PE. In PE, it is impossible for only the teacher to move the body and the students to just watch. It is impossible, and yet it is done in subjects other than P.E. without a care in the world.</li>
<li>The teacher is considered ‚Äúclass and lecture are different‚Äù. This is very good. I, too, would like to give classes as activities that impart karma, rather than one-way lectures that impart knowledge.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you prepare 90 or so slides on the subject of ‚ÄúIntellectual Production,‚Äù and then leave the room saying, ‚ÄúThank you very much for your attention,‚Äù it is not physical education at all.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Q: ‚ÄúQ: Aren‚Äôt you going to introduce yourself?‚Äù Uh, I wasn‚Äôt going to at all.</p>
<ul>
<li>A story about a sideline article that was under fire.
<ul>
<li>A story about how the title ‚ÄúI did it even if it was for free‚Äù was misinterpreted and flamed as ‚Äúit‚Äôs not good to do it for free.‚Äù</li>
<li>The purpose of the side job is learning, not money, hence the title, ‚ÄúI did it even if it was for free,‚Äù but it didn‚Äôt seem to get the point across very well</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Q: ‚ÄúQ: Doesn‚Äôt the company say anything about side hustles?‚Äù A: The company is very welcoming of side hustles.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drucker was the very first person who got me thinking about intellectual production.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><img src="https://gyazo.com/3f00253d373d817846db5cae9c1ae5e0/thumb/1000" alt="image"/></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One person does one person‚Äôs work and one sock is made.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Machines are introduced to increase productivity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At that time, Marx and others said that the capitalists who owned the equipment would take this increase in productivity, which would increase inequality and destabilize society, but in reality, this did not cause any major problems, and I don‚Äôt know why.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Production machines became more and more complex, and operating them required a lot of knowledge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Knowledge does not accumulate in the hands of capitalists, but in the hands of workers. Knowledge is transferred with the workers when the capitalist changes jobs because he or she doesn‚Äôt like it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When I say ‚Äúknowledge is capital,‚Äù it tends to sound like what I mean is ‚Äúthe source of competitiveness is shifting from the availability of capital to the availability of knowledge.‚Äù Drucker‚Äôs post-capitalist society can be roughly summarized in one page as follows</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And based on this, in a capitalist society, capitalists reproduced by expansion, increasing the amount of profit they could make by investing the profits they made in new production equipment. So, in a post-capitalist society, what strategy will individual workers use to expand and reproduce?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Of course, they‚Äôll expand and reproduce by investing in methods of intellectual production.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It means investing excess time and spare funds in methods of knowledge production and acquisition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can we obtain such knowledge that is difficult to obtain, rather than ‚Äúcommoditized knowledge‚Äù (knowledge that is easily available) that is circulated in books and other media?</p>
<ul>
<li>The ‚Äúparallel work is a learning opportunity‚Äù mentioned briefly in the first half is relevant here.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Addendum: Working graduate students are investing their extra time and extra money into the knowledge acquisition opportunity of graduate study in the first place. It may not have been verbalized, but many in this room have chosen this strategy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The phase in which the story begins to become convoluted when the question is asked what knowledge is, and the answer is practical knowledge.</p>
<ul>
<li>I was imagining <a href="./Definition-of-scholarship-in-the-study-of-scholarship" class="internal alias" data-slug="Definition-of-scholarship-in-the-study-of-scholarship">Definition of scholarship in the study of scholarship</a>.</li>
<li>It was further complicated by the keyword ‚Äútacit knowledge‚Äù in the context of not yet formalized or expressed. It was not appropriate because tacit knowledge has two meanings.
<ul>
<li>You‚Äôre right: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre using synonyms like <a href="./tacit-knowledge-(knowledge-management-terminology)" class="internal alias" data-slug="tacit-knowledge-(knowledge-management-terminology)">tacit knowledge (knowledge management terminology)</a> and formal knowledge, but you don‚Äôt know that unless you‚Äôve read the book.
<ul>
<li>Would they know if they had read it in the first place?</li>
<li>The term tacit knowledge is used in at least two ways.‚Äù
<ul>
<li>Polanyi‚Äôs <a href="./Dimensions-of-tacit-knowledge" class="internal alias" data-slug="Dimensions-of-tacit-knowledge">Dimensions of tacit knowledge</a>.</li>
<li>„Äå <a href="./knowledge-creation-company" class="internal alias" data-slug="knowledge-creation-company">knowledge creation company</a> „Äç</li>
<li>Ikujiro Nonaka‚Äôs <a href="./SECI-Model" class="internal alias" data-slug="SECI-Model">SECI Model</a> :.
<ul>
<li>A model in which knowledge creation in an organization is carried out through the transformation of tacit knowledge ‚Üí formal knowledge ‚Üí tacit knowledge.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When I look back at the discussion (what is knowledge, practical knowledge, etc.), I feel that there are ‚Äúabstract words‚Äù floating around that are not rooted in solid experience, and that I need to work on bringing those floating words down to the ground.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The tacit knowledge-formal knowledge counterpart is a model proposed by one person, Ikujiro Nonaka, who said, ‚ÄúIt would be clearer if we thought of it this way,‚Äù but it does not provide an answer to the question of what knowledge is. It is only a way of thinking and interpretation, not the truth.
<ul>
<li>Ikujiro Nonaka‚Äôs tacit knowledge is knowledge that has not been verbalized.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Formal knowledge, knowledge that can be described, and formal knowledge is not necessarily linked to results, so there must be other axes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>By the way, to add to this, ‚Äúcollaboration‚Äù in the SECI model means that we can communicate things that are not clearly verbalized by working together in the same place like this.
<ul>
<li>The very fact that these discussions take place is the equivalent of exercise in physical education.</li>
<li>This is related to the idea that ‚Äúclasses are not one-way lectures that convey information, but classes for acquiring karma, and classes are physical education.‚Äù Physical education cannot be acquired just by looking at books; it is acquired through repeated actual practice.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Q: ‚ÄúThe story is unstructured and difficult to understand.‚Äù</p>
<ul>
<li>A: There is nothing you can do about that. If you take the time to prepare lecture materials in advance, you can convey information in a structured manner, but then the audience becomes passive, just like watching TV. If we aim for free dialogue and interaction, we lose control of the flow.</li>
<li>A very brief description of the contents of the 12-hour workshop (not conveyed)</li>
<li>It is possible to create structured content through waterfall development, in which what is to be said is determined in advance and designed to scale. However, this is not possible with agile development, where the value to be provided changes based on the customer‚Äôs reaction onsite.</li>
<li>Agile development: a style of development in which small units are released quickly, observing customer reactions and learning what leads to customer value</li>
<li>The same goes for university lectures: create the syllabus in advance, design it accordingly, and release it once a year, and the next time you make improvements, it will be a year later, and so on.</li>
<li>If you want well-composed and structured materials in advance, it is very costly to prepare them, and the recipient will have to pay a reasonable price.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Talk about the for/while metaphor being difficult to understand.</p>
<ul>
<li>I‚Äôve gotten comments like that, but my cooking skills are so limited that I don‚Äôt know how to compare it to cooking.‚Äù</li>
<li>What is the difference between a for statement and a while statement? Mirin and Sake, Sashimi knife and Dewa knife.</li>
<li>I don‚Äôt know how to use the different types of salt, the results are obviously different, it‚Äôs awful.‚Äù</li>
<li>From someone who has already mastered the skill, it feels ‚Äúobviously different‚Äù.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pointing out that management may want to keep the knowledge in the organization.</p>
<ul>
<li>When management encourages descriptions to remain in the organization, it becomes formal knowledge, written knowledge.</li>
<li>On the other hand, when a program does not work well, the process of finding out what is wrong with the program is a know-how that has not been well verbalized.</li>
<li>Buying and using written knowledge and equipment that is not tied to a specific individual does not lead to competitive advantage. This is because other firms can procure knowledge and equipment in the same way.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Depending on whether you try to improve the process or move as you are told, it may or may not be intellectual production, even though the work may appear to be the same.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thinking of ideas‚Äù is not the only form of intellectual production.</li>
<li>For example, there is a huge amount of information, and how to handle it is a matter of process improvement.</li>
<li>‚ÄòSo what kind of work isn‚Äôt intellectual production?‚Äô When the process is clearly defined and no attempt is made to improve it.‚Äù</li>
<li>Clarify the problem: ‚ÄúThings aren‚Äôt going well at the moment, but what exactly is the problem?</li>
<li>Some jobs may be suitable for writing out on post-its and some may not, and I can‚Äôt imagine writing out improvements to factory processes on post-its.
<ul>
<li>Not having an image is not the same as it being useful. Writing it down and sharing it should be useful.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>‚ÄòDoes being aware of a problem change whether you‚Äôre intellectually productive or not?‚Äô If you don‚Äôt have an awareness of the problem, you will probably just do your job by tracing the methods you are given. Even if the same job is given to you, will you reproduce it in an expanded way so that you can use that time to invest in yourself?‚Äù
<ul>
<li>I‚Äôm not talking here about a problem and trying hard to improve the company or something noble like that, but rather, ‚ÄúIf I work as I‚Äôm told to do in my limited time in my life, I don‚Äôt have many opportunities to learn, and it‚Äôs simply a loss if I don‚Äôt have many opportunities to learn.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I heard it pointed out that Toyota‚Äôs factories can turn around without improving their processes and so on. It was pointed out that, on the contrary, Toyota‚Äôs factories are designed with a high probability of failure, with an emphasis on quickly identifying problems that need to be improved, and that they gain insight into where improvements should be made through the daily occurrence of failures, which was the topic of discussion. When the concept was exported and re-imported, somehow it turned into a lukewarm ‚Äúlet‚Äôs visualize tasks by putting sticky notes on a whiteboard‚Äù kind of talk.

<li>
<p>Q: ‚ÄúQ: What is the scope of raising intellectual productivity? Is it limited to software-based things? Or chairs or eating habits?‚Äù</p>
<ul>
<li>A: Not limited to software. There are four ways to augment humans: artifacts, methodology, language, and education. Trying to solve this problem with software is a narrow-minded attempt to do something with artifacts alone.‚Äù</li>
<li>‚ÄòCarbohydrates make me sleepy, and I‚Äôve actually experimented with measuring blood sugar to see how it affects me, N=1, but personally I don‚Äôt see much of a correlation.‚Äô</li>
<li>Programmer productivity‚Äù is a type of ‚Äúintellectual productivity,‚Äù and ‚Äú<a href="./Technology-Supporting-Coding" class="internal alias" data-slug="Technology-Supporting-Coding">Technology Supporting Coding</a>‚Äù explains how the intellectual productivity of programmers has improved with advances in programming languages.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Examples of specific methods of intellectual production</p>
<ul>
<li>First of all, many people already do this, but if you haven‚Äôt, this is very beneficial and you should do it. Second, what happens after writing? The solution to this problem is to arrange them in a list.</li>
<li>Difficult to keep information in the brain when it is written down, 100 sticky notes cannot be handled by the brain alone; 100 sticky notes are about this size when laid out on a desk, so you can list them without having to memorize them. Externalize memory. A methodology to increase human working memory capacity by using artifacts such as sticky notes and desks.</li>
<li>Write down ideas on sticky notes so you can list them and then think about them.</li>
<li>The means are not limited to lining up sticky notes on a desk, but can be viewed on a large display or on a whiteboard, but some form of listing is necessary.</li>
<li>What is to be done after making it possible to list them? If you categorize this, you will not be able to generate new ideas. You will only reproduce <a href="./Framing-by-Assumptions" class="internal alias" data-slug="Framing-by-Assumptions">Framing by Assumptions</a> in your brain.  <a href="./Do-not-classify." class="internal alias" data-slug="Do-not-classify.">Do not classify.</a></li>
<li>Reduce the apparent amount by bundling and adding a front cover.</li>
<li>KJ method
<ul>
<li>People who have heard of the KJ method‚Äù <span>‚áí</span> almost all</li>
<li>People who use the KJ method‚Äù ‚Üí several people</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Classroom Design by Audience</p>
<ul>
<li>How about the audience telling the instructor what kind of value they expect from him or her?</li>
<li>The skill of the recipient may be questioned.
<ul>
<li>Do I need to think about whether I should dig deeper into this story or get back on track?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Opinion that it is fun to go with the flow
<ul>
<li>I don‚Äôt want to control when I want to be stimulated because if I try to take it in the direction I want it to go, I get closer to what I already have.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Q: Is there a scale to measure intellectual productivity?</p>
<ul>
<li>Intellectual production involves a lot of things that are not measurable in the first place.
<ul>
<li>Drucker‚Äôs concept of the ‚Äúknowledge worker‚Äù</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If it is an improvement of an existing process, the time saved can be used as an indicator. There is no general measure of intellectual production that can be measured in this way.</li>
<li>Taylor‚Äôs scientific management method is the classic method</li>
<li>What is not measurable cannot be managed.
<ul>
<li>A portion of the task can be cut out and converted into something measurable.</li>
<li>For example, if you cut out ‚Äúwrite out 100 sticky notes about what you are going to talk about‚Äù as part of the ‚Äúbig task‚Äù of giving a 90-minute talk, this can measure progress.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is often said that productivity in Japan is low, WHY?</p>
<ul>
<li>‚Üí Isn‚Äôt it because they don‚Äôt want to improve a given process?
<ul>
<li>‚ÜíWhy does it happen?
<ul>
<li>I consider it not good to deviate from such education/rules.</li>
<li>Analyzing a job is considered skipping or hostile action.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>When I wrote my first book (Jython Programming), I was just an engineer and had no idea of writing a book for customer value; what I learned at MOT led me to believe that I needed to fulfill customer value, and I aimed to solve the customer‚Äôs blurred concerns I wrote the book. That is the technology behind coding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The story of knowledge production and knowledge acquisition, not verbally answered, but you can‚Äôt suddenly produce something from nothing (even new ideas are mostly a combination of existing elements), so you have to learn it first, and then modify it or combine it to make it better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Q: ‚ÄúQ: Is it intentional to say ‚Äòparallel work‚Äô instead of ‚Äòsub-work‚Äô?‚Äù A: ‚ÄúA: The term ‚Äòparallel work‚Äô is used in the sense of parallel work rather than subwork, and I personally think it is better to say ‚Äòparallel work rather than subwork‚Äô because it is not understood or mistakenly misinterpreted when it is explained verbally.‚Äù</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pointing out that value may also be created by advertising, ‚ÄúThis knowledge is valuable.‚Äù</p>
<ul>
<li>If the market reacts by advertising, it is beneficial.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I was actually thinking of interrupting the question phase every 15 minutes or so, but I forgot.</p>
<p>I think it was Drucker who said something close to this, ‚ÄúTake responsibility for your own competitiveness.‚Äù</p>

<li>Convert a relay camera to a 360-degree camera.</li>
<li>What should I do with the microphone?
<ul>
<li>Worst case scenario, if you put a wireless mic on the instructor, you can pick up only the instructor‚Äôs voice.</li>
<li>If the instructor continues the style of listening by the questioner, that microphone could pick up the questioner‚Äôs voice as well.
