<p>-In learning the concept of group formation, Jiro Kawakita’s expression “likely relationships” is difficult to grasp. In an attempt to remedy this, Masakazu Nakayama, author of “All About the NM Method,” Note 25, advocated focusing on “opposing relationships.
+To break the existing frame of thought that leads us to think “let’s get similar things together” when “organizing groups,” it is useful to focus on conflict. At a workshop I once held, a participant was having trouble forming groups. When I said, “You can put opposites in the same group, because opposites are a kind of relationship,” the advice seemed to break her preconceived notions, and she was able to form a very good group. (new paragraph)
Masakazu Nakayama, author of “All About NM Law,” Note 25, also advocated paying attention to “conflicts.</p>

<p>The verse could be separated between these two minutes.
The following sentence “At the stage of creating a group, it is not necessary to be able to explain what the relationship is. Jiro Kawakita recommends the following approach: “First, you gather things that seem vaguely related in one place to form a group, and then you try to explain the contents of the group. If you can easily explain the contents of the group, it is a good group. If not, you just need to break up the group, so it is important not to set your mind too high at this stage. is a natural connection to the next section, but I would like to include the story [There is more than one conflict.</p>

<p>Sometimes, I skip the “<a href="./illustration" class="internal" data-slug="illustration">illustration</a>” phase. I think you should experience it several times to learn how to use it.

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The program I created in 2013 was collaborative, but from my experience experimenting with it internally, I don’t think collaborative editing is really necessary. This is probably because the process of “organizing thoughts” is based on individual subjectivity, interacting with the individual’s inner self. In addition, “fusen arrangement” contains information that is not verbalized, so when another person sees what another person has arranged, he or she may not understand the intention of the arrangement and may inadvertently destroy it. If you are going to share a fusen arrangement with multiple people, you need to do it while communicating closely with them by viewing and editing it together.</li>

<p>Since it is designed to be placed on a desk by one person, the labels are smaller and the pens are thinner accordingly. This size of fusen, when placed side by side on an A4 sheet of paper, allows for 25 sheets to be pasted.
To bite more into it:.
If you do it alone, there is no need to use large stickies. Smaller stickies can be arranged more in a limited space. So I use small sticky notes and a thin pen. This size sticky note can hold 25 sheets horizontally or 28 sheets vertically when placed side by side on an A4 sheet of paper.</p>
