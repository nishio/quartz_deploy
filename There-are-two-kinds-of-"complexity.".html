<li>There is a discrepancy in the meaning of “<a href="./complex" class="internal" data-slug="complex">complex</a>” as used by the two.</li>
<li>Casual gamers tend to request more elements, thereby complicating the game.”

<li>Making a small number of button combinations work is loaded for many people’s cognition = “cognitively complex.”</li>
<li>That’s why the “cognitively simple design” that “one function is triggered by pressing one button” is chosen.</li>
<li>As a result, TV remotes are full of buttons and the remotes look “complicated”.</li>

<p>R_Nikaido: I’ve been thinking recently about why games are becoming more and more complex and the elements are becoming more and more jumbled, and I used to think that it was because they had to add elements to differentiate themselves from sequels and other works, but actually it’s not just that. It’s not just that, it’s that “<a href="./the-more-complicated-it-is,-the-more-interesting-most-people-find-it" class="internal alias" data-slug="the-more-complicated-it-is,-the-more-interesting-most-people-find-it">the more complicated it is, the more interesting most people find it</a>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a different perception, “something with a limit of complexity that a person can perceive is interesting to him because it is ‘learnable content’ for him”.
So, complex content is not interesting to everyone, but it is very interesting to those who are at the limit of recognizable complexity.</p>

Content that is too complex is “not interesting because it is too complex to learn because you can’t discover regularities.”
Content with just the right amount of complexity is “interesting because you can discover regularities and learn from them.”</p>

They are more likely to enjoy the pleasure of touch and encountering new elements. Therefore, the more elements there are, the more casual people can enjoy the game.</p>

I think that would be better.</p>

You have to think carefully about how to fight to your advantage. It’s a tough act, and it requires a lot of thinking.</p>
<p>So I thought a simple game would be like forcing people to play in a bind.</p>

<p>And each of them is not so much as absolutely necessary in terms of the system. But this was “necessary”.</p>

If the game only allows you to jump, you have to do “step over with a good running start and good timing”.</p>
<p>On the other hand, It Takes Two makes you jump over it by “jump → jump in the air → dash in the air”.</p>

The aerial control is easy to do, so it is easy to fine-tune the direction, and you can return to the original foothold if you think you missed it.</p>
<p>Also, the fun of the operation has been raised because there are operations that can be done in the air.</p>

It Takes Two has the advantage that you don’t feel bored just jumping over simple holes, which is better for casual players.</p>
