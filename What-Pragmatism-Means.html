<p>James’s “pragmatism” is proposed as the answer to the conflict between rationalism and empiricism. Pragmatism adheres to facts and concreteness, observing and generalizing truth as working in particular cases. This becomes a class name for all of the concrete working values in experience. For the rationalist, it is pure abstraction and must be respected by its name alone.</p>
<p>The fragment “What Pragmatism Means” shows how pragmatism seeks to resolve the conflict between rationalism and empiricism. The fragment “The Present Dilemma in Philosophy” asks how the conflict between rationalists and empiricists affects our daily lives and social culture.</p>
<p>The fragment “PRAGMATISM” points out three types of reality that the new truth must take into account. In addition, in “What Pragmatism Means,” he states that pragmatism broadens the search for God. These perspectives are important for a better understanding of pragmatism.</p>
<p>The “Plain Stream of Pragmatism” also states that truth is “that which can be well explained.” This is consistent with the viewpoint that pragmatism holds that truth is shaped by experience and human contribution.</p>
<p>In “Some Metaphysical Problems Pragmatically Considered,” questions are raised about how pragmatism reconciles the conflict between rationalism and empiricism, how the debate between materialism and theism should be resolved, how the conflict between free will and determinism questions are raised: how should the debate between materialism and theism be resolved, and how should the conflict between free will and determinism be resolved?</p>
<p>In “Pragmatism and Truth,” truth is considered to be an idea operating within experience, not a “congruence” with facts. This is consistent with the pragmatist perspective that truth is formed by experience and human contribution.</p>
<p>Pragmatism states that truth is that which is useful to life. This is consistent with pragmatism’s viewpoint that truth is shaped by experience and human contribution.</p>
<p>Fragment “Experience Processes and the Creation of Meaning” Study Group 4 presents the idea that pragmatism determines correctness by usefulness. This is consistent with the viewpoint that pragmatism holds that truth is shaped by experience and human contribution.</p>
<p>Fragment “Pragmatism” states that truth is that which is useful to life. This is consistent with the viewpoint that pragmatism holds that truth is shaped by experience and human contribution.</p>
<p>The fragment “Pluralistic Pragmatism” states that truth is nurtured inside all finite experience. This is consistent with the viewpoint that pragmatism holds that truth is formed by experience and human contribution.</p>
<p>The fragment “Pragmatism” shows the idea that rightness or wrongness is based on usefulness. This is consistent with the viewpoint that pragmatism holds that truth is shaped by experience and human contribution.</p>

<p>James’ “Pragmatism” discusses the conflict between rationalism and empiricism, noting that modern people have empiricist tendencies but also seek religious elements. Pragmatism has an anti-intellectualist bent and states that truth is defined by its relationship to experience. This begs the question, “How should the conflict between rationalists and empiricists be resolved?” This could be one answer to the question, “How should the conflict between rationalists and empiricists be resolved?</p>
<p>Pragmatism adheres to facts and concreteness, observing and generalizing truth as working in particular cases. It becomes a class name that refers to all of the concrete working values in experience. For the rationalist, it is pure abstraction and must be respected by its name alone.</p>
<p>Questions include: how does the conflict between rationalists and empiricists affect our daily lives and social culture, and how should these conflicts be resolved?</p>

<p>Pragmatism adheres to <a href="./fact" class="internal" data-slug="fact">fact</a> and <a href="./concreteness" class="internal" data-slug="concreteness">concreteness</a>, observing and generalizing truth as working in specific cases. It becomes a class name that refers to all of the specific working values in experience. For the rationalist, it is a purely abstract concept and must be honored by its name alone.</p>
<p>Pragmatism follows the example of its sister science of interpreting the unobserved by the observed. It harmonizes the old with the new. It transforms the absolutely vacuous notion of a static relationship of “correspondence” between our minds and reality into a rich and active exchange between our particular thoughts and the macrocosm of other experiences in which they play a role and are utilized.</p>
<p>Pragmatism claims to have the potential to reconcile empiricist ways of thinking with the religious demands of man. Modern idealistic philosophy tends to alienate those with a disposition to love facts. It is overly intellectualistic. Archaic theism was bad enough in portraying God as a collection of incomprehensible or ridiculous “attributes,” but it kept in touch with concrete reality as long as it held strongly to the logic of design. But since Darwinism at once eliminated the idea of design from the “scientific” mind, theism has lost its footing.</p>
<p>Pragmatism, while faithful to the facts, does not have the materialistic bias that ordinary empiricism harbors. Nor does it have any objection to the realization of abstract concepts. If theological ideas prove to have value in concrete life, they are true for pragmatism and depend entirely on their relation to other truths to which they must be admitted.</p>
<p>Pragmatism broadens the search for God. Rationalism adheres to logic and the heavenly realm. Empiricism adheres to the external senses. Pragmatism accepts everything, pursues with logic and with the senses, and considers even the most personal and humble experiences. It considers even mystical experiences that have practical consequences. It even considers God as living in our personal facts.</p>
