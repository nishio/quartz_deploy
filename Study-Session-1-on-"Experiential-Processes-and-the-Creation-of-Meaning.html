<ul>
<li>experience process and the creation of meaning.”</li>
<li>Concepts that Carl Rogers used in practice in doing psychotherapy.</li>
<li>Eugene Gendlin organized.</li>
<li>The Japanese translation is stiff, but the English is Experiencing</li>
</ul>
<p>What does it mean?</p>
<ul>
<li>“the process of experience and the creation of meaning.”</li>
<li>There are several dimensions.
<ul>
<li>Relationships among linguistic symbols</li>
<li>Relationship between the symbol and the object
<ul>
<li>For example, the symmetrical relationship between the symbol “canine” and the “four-legged thing you often see on the street”.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Besides this, there is the dimension of “experience.”
<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>The translations of “experience” and “experience” are shaky, but both are Experience.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dimensions of Experience
<ul>
<li>What is</li>
<li>It is easy to understand when we think of “when symbols do not properly symbolize the meaning we experience.”</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>waving, pointing, talking at length, coming up with metaphors, giving examples, silence to find words</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>In other words, there is a fuzziness, excitement, discomfort, etc. that I can’t quite put my finger on.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This state is described as “We are experiencing a meaning
<ul>
<li>Another way to say “we feel a meaning” means the same thing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>We notice that “symbols that usually seem to contain our meaning do not seem to be appropriate to this present sense of meaning.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>When I try to express in words what I’m mulling over, it doesn’t seem to match.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>In other words, meaning is not just a matter of things or symbols or their relationship… It is also something that is felt and experienced.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Q: “Are there verbalized and non-verbalized meanings?”</li>
<li>A: There is a meaning that is not verbalized. You have all experienced the feeling that “there is something before it is verbalized,” and that is what we call “felt meaning,” as I will explain below.
<ul>
<li>And we’ll focus on that later.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Since this paper deals with this kind of “meaning,” I will use the expressions “felt meaning” and “experienced meaning.</li>
<li>The Japanese translation is considered “felt meaning.”
<ul>
<li>It comes up many times after this as a single lumpy phrase, “felt meaning.”</li>
<li>How does perceived meaning work in cognition?” is the theme of the book.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>The Japanese translation process has broken it up into different symbols, making it difficult to understand the relationship between the symbols.
<ul>
<li><img src="https://gyazo.com/2643404f720ed119f010011e5201dac9/thumb/1000" alt="image"/>
<ul>
<li>Gendlin clearly states that experienced meaning = felt meaing.</li>
<li>In later Thinking at the Edge, felt sense is often used, which translates to “<a href="./felt-sense" class="internal alias" data-slug="felt-sense">felt sense</a>.”</li>
<li>In Japanese, the connection between symbols is not clear, so it is good to understand the connection in English</li>

<li>(Translation by Nishio)
<ul>
<li>Conceptualization and expression are different from experience and emotion.</li>
<li>Experiences and emotions have meaning apart from conceptualization and expression.</li>
<li>We call this “felt meaning.</li>
<li>Conceptualizations and expressions may or may not be appropriate for their “felt meaning.”</li>
<li>What is the relationship between this conceptualization or representation, otherwise known as “structuring with symbols” and “felt meaning”?</li>
<li>Various. (There are seven)</li>
<li>In the chapters ahead in this book, I will take a closer look at the function that “felt meaning” has in cognition by scrutinizing these relationships.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Necessary functions in cognition</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Chapter II, “Examples of Perceived Meanings at Work in Cognition,” gives various examples.</p>
<ul>
<li>If I trace it here, it’s going to be “just a verbatim degraded copy of a list of examples on paper,” so I’ll skip it.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<p>The second half of B. is the hub of important concepts, so I’ll just introduce that part.</p>

<li>about the “felt meaning” fulfilling a specific function, necessary for cognition.
<ol>
<li>Problem Solving
- The concept of “<a href="./idea" class="internal" data-slug="idea">idea</a> (suggestions)” in [Dewey.
<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>When you are thinking about solving some problem, you suddenly “get an idea” (we’ve all experienced it, right?).
<ul>
<li>This “idea” seems to involve “felt meaning”.</li>
<li>When I was thinking about the idea, I thought, “Oh, why don’t I do this? and it is symbolized after the fact.</li>
<li>For example, on a math test in middle school or so, there are problems that can be solved by expanding and organizing, and there are problems that cannot. In the latter case, I wonder for a while “how to solve it,” and then I come up with something like “Oh, I did something like this in a problem I solved before.
<ul>
<li>Here’s a “Something Before Language” right here.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>reproduction and segmentation
<ul>
<li>Recreation = “felt meaning” is also used in the process of “forgetting and remembering”.
<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>‘Oh, I was going to say something, but what was it?’
<ul>
<li>There is a sense in which “what I was going to say” exists.</li>
<li>But that hasn’t been symbolized yet.</li>
<li>I want to verbalize this, which is only pointed to by the messy symbol of “what I was going to say.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Same composition as “come up with a solution.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>ARTICULATING

The word is used both in the situation “this product can be broken down into its parts” and “he can speak fluently and consistently on the subject.

<ul>
<li>For example, a client comes in and says, “I’m having a hard time with my heart.</li>
<li>I don’t understand why they say, “I’m having a hard time with my heart.</li>
<li>At least two things can be said
<ul>
<li>There (in the client) is a subjective “hard feeling”.</li>
<li>He can’t even put into words what it is and why it exists.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>in other words
<ul>
<li>An ongoing experience of spiciness (Experiencing) is present and not yet symbolized.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Psychotherapy facilitates this segmentation.
<ul>
<li>Why prompt?</li>
<li>It is known empirically in the field of psychotherapy that this reduces subjective distress, etc.

<li>I don’t know why it’s valid since it’s “empirical.”</li>
<li><a href="./cognitive-therapy" class="internal alias" data-slug="cognitive-therapy">cognitive therapy</a> But I do the “write what you feel on paper” thing.</li>

<p>In client-centered therapy, the client’s felt experience is specifically explored in his or her own words.</p>

<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Other methods provide diagnostic concepts emanating from the theoretical collation framework of the therapist</p>

<ul>

<p>However, upon closer examination, we find that another school of therapy places the same emphasis on the client’s own direct discovery of feelings and experiences within the client that are generally predicted by the diagnosis.</p>

<p>Like scaffolding for a building under construction, it will be removed as useless when the actual building is completed.</p>

<li>What is important is that clients are able to express in their own words what they are experiencing and feeling</li>
<li>Diagnosis is just a scaffold to help with that.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>A diagnosis may be made in a day from the material of an interview or a projective test (<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/> e.g. Rorschach test). However, it takes a long time for the client himself to discover and grasp his internal feelings and experiences, and it must be based on feelings, not on concepts.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>The treatment must be based on his own unique experience, not on conceptual generalizations. For this reason, every form of treatment consists of an individual’s effort to experience more deeply and to grasp and symbolize his own felt experience.</p>

<p>Parallel functional relationships</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>“Parallel” is defined as “a one-to-one correspondence between the felt meaning and the symbol.”</p>
<ul>
<li>I think we can roughly understand “simple patterns” now.</li>
<li>It’s easier to understand after seeing the “non-parallel” examples in the second half than to discuss definitions here.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Direct Reference (<a href="./DIRECT-REFERENCE" class="internal alias" data-slug="DIRECT-REFERENCE">DIRECT REFERENCE</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, when you know but forget and can’t find the words.
<ul>
<li>For something I can’t remember, I ask myself, “Was it A? No, it wasn’t. Was it B? Yes, yes, B.”</li>
<li>This “unspoken blur” and “A” are directly matched against each other.</li>
<li>‘I was going to say something, what was it?’ “A?” “No, no.” “B?” “Yes, yes, that!”</li>
<li>The symbols “A” and “B” are what I was going to say.
<ul>
<li><img src="https://gyazo.com/fa84b53d99aa7415926aa1bc623432df/thumb/1000" alt="image"/>
<ul>
<li>F is “felt meaning” (felt meaning)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Not limited to linguistic symbols
<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>It is very difficult to explain in writing here in language or to communicate over video conferencing that…</li>

<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Imagine bowling, for example.
<ul>
<li>That, that move.
<ul>
<li>(and when I mentioned it, it became the linguistic symbol “that move”)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>For example, someone talking about how “attention is like a spotlight to me,” and then he remembered something and looked dazzled.
<ul>
<li>This is a symbol of “situation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The role of symbols here is to point to “felt meaning,” so they do not have to be linguistic symbols if they can do that
<ul>
<li>You can point to it with the word “dazzle,” you can squint your eyes in a dazzling manner, or you can move your hand to cover your eyes</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>It’s obvious to those who have experienced it, but it’s hard to communicate it with linguistic symbols to those who haven’t…</li>
<li>Not “dazzling.”
<ul>
<li>That’s what I see in my clients and think on my own, not a symbol that points to a “felt meaning” in them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the client expresses “hand movements as if trying to block out the light,” this is a symbol
<ul>
<li>A trained clean-language coach would no doubt ask, “What does that (pointing to a movement) look like?” He or she would ask, “What is that (pointing to a movement)?
<ul>
<li>Precedence over linguistic symbols
<ul>
<li>The symbols of movement have a stronger connection to “what has not yet been put into words” than the linguistic symbols.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This is currently not at all possible with Keichobot, and there is no way to make it possible.</li>

<li>It’s translated as a metaphor, but the discussion has nothing to do with whether it’s a metaphor or a direct metaphor.
<ul>
<li>Better to think of it as “parable.”</li>
<li>Here we call them “metaphors” as they are in English.</li>
<li>Strictly speaking, the term “metaphor” refers to the creation of new meanings from existing symbols, as in “simile” and “metaphor.</li>

<li>You can’t save time.</li>

<li>I don’t mean to imply that “only one person who owns the padlock can lock it.”</li>
<li>I’m saying that you don’t need the “key needed to unlock the door” when you lock it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In every example, the symbol is used in a way that is different from its original meaning.</li>
<li>A situation where the meaning felt in the existing symbols cannot be accurately expressed.
<ul>
<li>So we create new bonds to symbols that are not normally connected and express them.</li>

<li>(2) So, I’m trying to find an overlap by expanding on it.</li>
<li>(Overlap is still a little uncomfortable because it sounds like and.)</li>

<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>This is translated as “understanding,” but since we will be talking a lot about understanding in the next section, I think it is confusing to use the same translation.
<ul>
<li>I was confused too.
- <a href="./Misconceptions-about-understanding-(COMPREHENSION)" class="internal alias" data-slug="Misconceptions-about-understanding-(COMPREHENSION)">Misconceptions about understanding (COMPREHENSION)</a></li>
<li>This is a nuance rather than “understanding.”

<ul>
<li>(This is an example of non-parallel symbol usage and does not literally mean “fully understood.“)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I will refer to it verbally below as “COMPREHENSION.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It already has a felt meaning and we want to symbolize it.
<ul>
<li>But none of the existing symbols fit perfectly with what I want to say.</li>
<li>So combine existing symbols.</li>
<li>This is COMPREHENSION</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Isn’t that the same explanation you gave at METAPHOR?” You thought? Correct!
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>To invent a metaphor to express a prior felt meaning is “comprehension.” (p.117)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>It clearly states that creating a parable is COMPREHENSION.
<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>I don’t want to use the translation “understanding” because of this too.</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>So, for example, “understanding” in “reading a book and understanding what it says” or “seeing a metaphor and understanding what it means” is different from COMPREHENSION. Please note.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Example
<ul>
<li>Tradition is to keep the fire burning.”</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>I guess that means it’s important to protect them so they don’t disappear?”</li>
<li>Tradition is about preserving the fire, not worshipping the ashes.</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>I see <img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/fully understood/icon" alt="fully understood.icon" height="19.5"/>, you are saying that instead of worshipping the ashes (=classical music), which are a byproduct of the fire and no longer change, we should strive to keep the fire (=composer), which is currently creating new light, alive, and that is what preserving tradition is all about.
<ul>
<li>The “felt meaning” created in Nishio by reading the metaphor has become a new symbol by COMPREHENSION
<ul>
<li>New symbols are emerging, like “light.”</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>A felt meaning that is already called by RECOGNITION is symbolized by EXPLICATION.</li>
<li>similarly</li>
<li>METAPHOR makes the already created FELT MEANING into a symbol by COMPREHENSION</li>
<li>RECOGNITION/EXPLICATION is a parallel relationship and therefore the same symbol.</li>
<li>METAPHOR/COMPREHENSION is a creative (non-parallel) relationship, so it can be different symbols</li>

<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>This “understanding” uses UNDERSTAND, which is different from the COMPREHENSION translation “understanding”</li>

<blockquote>
<p>A set of symbols comes to be understood with the help of many other experienced meanings, not just the one felt meaning they represent (p. 158).</p>

</li>
<li>Example: “A beginner learns a saying; after more than 20 years of experience, he understands the meaning of the saying in a different and more complete way, but when he tries to teach it to his student, he cannot find a better expression (=symbolization) for its meaning than the first word he learned 20 years ago.”
<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>A common one in math books.
<ul>
<li>When I first saw the definition of a certain mathematical concept, I didn’t know what it meant.</li>
<li>I read various examples and explanations and think, “I see what you mean.</li>
<li>I took another look at the definition, thinking, “Why didn’t you just write that?” and that’s exactly what it said.</li>

<ul>
<li>It is possible to say that METAPHOR/COMPREHENSION is also a RELEVANCE, just as it is possible to say</li>
<li>But instead of doing so, Eugene Gendlin argues, it is better to see it as two perspectives (p. 159).</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>I painted a picture.

<li>The METAPHOR/COMPREHENSION perspective dictates the relationship between a felt meaning and other felt meanings</li>
<li>The perspective of RELEVANCE is the connection between other felt meanings that define the felt meaning we are now focusing on.</li>
<li>That the direction of the arrows are reversed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I’m sure we’ve all had the experience of understanding a newly seen symbol (e.g., a formula in a textbook) because we knew something about it.

<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>The choice of the word CIRCUMLOCUTION is not good, says the author himself.
<ul>
<li>In addition, I chose “phrase” as a translation.</li>
<li>I think this is getting confusing.</li>
<li>Basic premise: I’m not talking exclusively about linguistic symbols.
<ul>
<li>How about the translation, “parlance?”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>CIRCUMLOCUTION
<ul>
<li>A roundabout or indirect way of speaking; thus:
<ul>
<li>Unnecessary use of extra words to express an idea, such as a pleonastic phrase (sometimes driven by an attempt at emphatic clarity) or a wordy substitution (the latter driven by euphemistic intent, pedagogic intent, or sometimes loquaciousness alone).</li>
<li>Necessary use of a phrase to circumvent either a vocabulary fault (of speaker or listener) or a lexical gap, either monolingually or in translation.
<ul>
<li>A technical word, such as hyperkalemia or hypoallergenic, can be glossed for general audiences with a circumlocution, such as “high potassium level” or “less likely to cause allergies” (respectively).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I guess the latter example is closer.
<ul>
<li>I used the symbol “hyperkalemia” to express what I wanted to convey, but since it may not be understood, I used “high potassium level” again to express the same thing (in Japanese, it is “hyperkalemia” ← This addition by Nishio is also an example of CIRCUMLOCUTION).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After giving a certain explanation to convey something, then add more explanations for the same thing.
<ul>
<li>Not limited to words, but may also use diagrams and gestures</li>
<li>Express the same “felt meaning” with different symbols.</li>
<li><img src="https://gyazo.com/4c1be7c19297429975f33fbf8bbfe0e0/thumb/1000" alt="image"/>
<ul>
<li>This is another example of CIRCUMLOCUTION
<ul>
<li>After expressing it with the symbol of a word, the same thing was expressed with the symbol of a figure.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>I think this is more of a “paraphrase” than a “phrase”.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The first half of this explanation, “the same thing” and “different expressions”, is converted to “related things”.
<ul>
<li>The “same thing” is, of course, inclusive.</li>
<li>CIRCUMLOCUTION is occurring that connects a number of related things like this document.</li>
<li>This clarifies “what I wanted to convey.

</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Example, “I bought a new phone yesterday - oh, I’m talking about the one I don’t carry around.”
<ul>
<li>Even if the word “phone” conjures up an image of a cell phone, it’s modified.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Here’s another real-life example
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>In <a href="./cognitive-therapy" class="internal alias" data-slug="cognitive-therapy">cognitive therapy</a>, we do things like “write what you feel on paper,” but by putting subjective things into words and putting them outside of yourself, you can “treat them objectively/third-party/as if they were someone else/<a href="./with" class="internal" data-slug="with">with</a> distance/<a href="./associate" class="internal" data-slug="associate">associate</a>” with them. I think.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>This is just a direct record of my thought process.</li>
<li>The first verbalized symbol was “objectively.”</li>
<li>Then I felt like I wasn’t saying what I wanted to say.</li>
<li>I’m adding some symbols.</li>
<li>So, I took out five and looked at them, and then chose the third one, “as if it were someone else’s business”.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>RELEVANCE and CIRCUMLOCUTION
<ul>
<li>Both create relationships.</li>
<li>RELEVANCE has a certain felt meaning that already exists, and it is influencing the felt meaning that is now being created.
<ul>
<li>Past experiences help us understand now.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>CIRCUMLOCUTION now the felt meaning invoked by the symbol is influencing the felt meaning of the past
<ul>
<li>The language of the present reinforces the explanation of the past.</li>

<ul>
<li>When a person tries to put into words something F that he/she can’t say well and says A, it’s not a parallel EXPLICATION of course because it’s “not well said”!
<ul>
<li>The meaning is distorted.</li>
<li>Symbols are not being used as they should be.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>So the FA that RECOGNITIONed by the person who heard it is of course not F</li>
<li>Let’s stop the RECOGNITION there.
<ul>
<li>This is the fundamental idea of Clean Language</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>I understand why the rule is “don’t change the words the speaker used.”</p>

<ul>
<li>What that F is is not clear to the listener, but it’s not a practical problem.</li>

</li>
<li>CIRCUMLOCUTION is generated by asking a question to F

<p>He previously explained Keichobot’s behavior as “clean language and that’s the way the rules are.”</p>
<ul>
<li>I can now explain without attributing it to “it’s a rule.”</li>
<li>Since this is the kind of mechanism that encourages verbalization, we should not RECOGNITION the symbols uttered by the user.
<ul>
<li>That’s why Clean Language coaches are trained to “never interpret a client’s words without their permission.”</li>
<li>No need to understand user symbols, even when software acts as a coach</li>
<li>Since the goal is to encourage this process, we only need to know what the symbols represented as a phenomenon are and what symbols are represented as being between them!</li>

<p>question</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Q: I thought Keichobot “doesn’t change the words used by the speaker” because “it’s too difficult to change software-wise”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A: Quite the opposite. When I went to study Clean Language, I learned the rule that the listener should not change the speaker’s words. At the time I didn’t understand the principle of why this was so. I thought, “I’m not allowed to change or interpret the speaker’s words…hmmm, that’s a lot of work for a human, but isn’t that something software is better at?” I thought. So I made it, and that’s how it went.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Q: About this diagram</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="https://gyazo.com/73018abef8816d7d394a9c55c94a5b89/thumb/1000" alt="image"/></li>
<li>Does the information that Mr. A wanted to convey not necessarily match the information that Mr. B understood?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>A: They do not necessarily match.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, “When I read a text of a poem many times, a different meaning comes out” or “When I read a book I read when I was young and read it again after a long time, I received from it a meaning that I did not notice when I was young.</li>
<li>This process is non-parallel and creative, so new meanings are being created, and they don’t necessarily correspond to what Mr. A thinks they mean.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Q: What does it mean that Mr. B COMPREHENSIONED…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A: First of all, as a basic premise, Mr. B is not COMPREHENSION in this figure.</p>
<ul>
<li>COMPREHENSION on the left, METAPHOR on the right</li>
<li>I’m confused because it’s the opposite of everyday conversational usage, but as the label Gendlin gave, “the process of seeing a symbol and thinking of its meaning” is METAPHOR, not COMPREHENSION.</li>
<li>So, when Mr. B sees the symbols that Mr. A produced and “something vaguely comes into his brain,” what comes into his mind does not necessarily match what Mr. A wanted to convey.
<ul>
<li>In order to bring this closer, it is necessary to go through the process of Mr. B outputting his vague fuzziness in words, and then Mr. A looking at it, directly comparing the vague fuzziness that came to his mind with “what I wanted to say,” and testing whether he says “Yes, that’s what I wanted to say” or not.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Not necessarily a match.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Rather, they do not match in most cases.</li>
<li>The reason why the parallel symbols are almost identical is that they have been rubbed together in people’s conversations, so they have converged in a way that they are all connected to the same thing in everyone’s brain.
<ul>
<li>When I see the symbol “canine,” I don’t think of a red, thorny plant, nor do I think of something metal with a rounded tip that I put in my mouth when I eat.</li>
<li>Young humans who have not yet converged on the word “canine” for “a four-legged animal that meows”.</li>
<li>Learning results in convergence.
<ul>
<li>As we communicate and fail and succeed, we’re choosing to “connect symbols and meanings” that are more successful.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This is what Merleau-Ponty calls “<a href="./Institutionalized-language" class="internal alias" data-slug="Institutionalized-language">Institutionalized language</a>,” a refined language</li>
<li>We tend to think only of those refined words, but the “just-born words” that were just said before they were institutionalized, before they were mumbled and poorly said, are not parallel, they are distorted, they didn’t come straight down.</li>
<li>Therefore, Gendlin’s idea is that we need to pay attention to the non-parallel when we think about verbalizing such things.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Q: If the blur is explicit, do you put it out on COMPREHENSION?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A: That “explicit” in “the blurring is explicit” is uncomfortable for me.</p>
<ul>
<li>Moyamoya = felt sense, I think.</li>
<li>The felt sense evoked by the word is somewhat clear</li>
<li>Moyamoya’s felt sense is not yet clear.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Q: Do we need to make full use of the four relationships in order to verbalize such mumbo-jumbo?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A: Yes.</p>
