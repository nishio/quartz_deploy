<li>If you want to essentially quell anxiety, you need to be able to communicate.</li>

- I get tangled up with [[people who attack other people]] when I go in and say that they are making claims that I don't agree with and that's not true. I used to think I was the victim, but I guess not. People like that are insecure, and they find [[peace of mind]] by criticizing others to relieve their insecurity. They resent me because I suddenly pull them away from it with an &quot;attack&quot; in the name of &quot;[[good argument]]. I guess they are the victims.
    - I just don't like information that I think is wrong to be circulated without being corrected, so I guess I should correct them but not fold them in with more righteous arguments if they are offended by the correction.
