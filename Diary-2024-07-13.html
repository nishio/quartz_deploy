It is not good to write something critical of an organization because it tends to be interpreted as criticism of the organization to which you belong.
A situation where one person in a volunteer circle who is not paid in any way is criticizing a certain kind of behavior that is not actually considered a problem by the organization that is the main payer of the salary.

<p>Recently, politicians are expected to be perfect, or rather, perfect because they have to choose the best person, but there is no such thing as perfect, so they should just update each other. But there is no such thing as perfect, so we should update each other.

I don’t like to spread it around too much and Twitter is not the best place to talk about this kind of thing, so I’m going to limit the number of replies. I tried to soften the strong expressions by making it comical, but there were some good parts and some bad parts, so I will supplement the content.</p>
<p>I myself have been told by the media that “this is the way it should be” in terms of the direction of my statements during the campaign, but it was a bit softer, not the best use of the words regulation or repression. No exaggeration. I was also explained why, and I understood it as my job. Personal opinions are another thing, but it’s very important to draw the line there. I’ve never actually felt the pressure to be funny, at least not to me.</p>
<p>And what I was told was that it is not good to talk too much about by-names because it is biased, not that we should not talk about anything other than the four main candidates. I find the word “certain” to be polysyllabic and inconvenient. I meant to say “pick any one person,” but it could also mean “a fixed portion.</p>
<p>I understand and am aware of that, but in my personal opinion, shouldn’t we be taking up more things? I don’t want to say who I voted for because of the secret election. I don’t want to say who I voted for because of the secret election, but I think it would be easier to talk about this or that on a by-name basis. That’s what I was talking about.</p>
<p>Since this is a live broadcast, please excuse the language. The letter of a statement does not necessarily equal the intended idea, the way you speak, and the contents of your head. I will try to bring it closer, though. I have my ideas, you have yours, and I am not speaking for anyone else.</p>
<p>I am sorry for the compliments, but I thought there were some discrepancies, partly due to my lack of ability. I will continue to work hard and try to express myself more politely.
