</ul>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>I‚Äôm thinking about the ability to see an opportunity and recognize it as an opportunity.</p>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/gpt/icon" alt="gpt.icon" height="19.5"/>The ability to see an opportunity and recognize it as an opportunity is largely based on <a href="./insight" class="internal" data-slug="insight">insight</a>, <a href="./intuition" class="internal" data-slug="intuition">intuition</a>, and <a href="./judgment-based-on-experience" class="internal alias" data-slug="judgment-based-on-experience">judgment based on experience</a>. This can also be described as the ability to quickly identify elements of opportunity in complex situations and information, and to take action. To hone this ability, it is important to be <a href="./attentive" class="internal" data-slug="attentive">attentive</a>, not to miss <a href="./changes-in-circumstances" class="internal alias" data-slug="changes-in-circumstances">changes in circumstances</a> and patterns, and to have <a href="./the-ability-to-make-instantaneous-judgments" class="internal alias" data-slug="the-ability-to-make-instantaneous-judgments">the ability to make instantaneous judgments</a> based on a wide variety of experiences.</p>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>This is difficult to train. Whether or not you think something is an opportunity is influenced by <a href="./values" class="internal" data-slug="values">values</a>, <a href="./world-view" class="internal alias" data-slug="world-view">world view</a>, <a href="./future-forecast" class="internal alias" data-slug="future-forecast">future forecast</a>, and other <a href="./subject" class="internal" data-slug="subject">subject</a> things, so even if someone who has noticed an opportunity explains it to you, you will not recognize it as an opportunity.</p>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/gpt/icon" alt="gpt.icon" height="19.5"/>Indeed, recognizing an opportunity as an opportunity involves so many individual values and perspectives that it is sometimes difficult to accept it as it is, even when others explain it to you. This issue is difficult to master through training because it involves more than just understanding the facts; it is also deeply related to the beliefs and expectations behind them. This is because an individual‚Äôs <a href="./internal-filter" class="internal alias" data-slug="internal-filter">internal filter</a> largely determines what he or she sees as an opportunity. In these situations, it may be helpful to understand <a href="./Perspectives-of-Others" class="internal alias" data-slug="Perspectives-of-Others">Perspectives of Others</a> and <a href="./reevaluate-one's-values" class="internal alias" data-slug="reevaluate-one's-values">reevaluate one‚Äôs values</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>For those who are aware of the opportunity, the top priority task is to take advantage of it, and <a href="./persuading" class="internal" data-slug="persuading">persuading</a> those who do not understand the opportunity even after it is explained to them is often a small contribution to ‚Äú<a href="./conjugation" class="internal" data-slug="conjugation">conjugation</a>. The principle of ‚Äú[Don‚Äôt persuade people you don‚Äôt need to persuade.</p>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/gpt/icon" alt="gpt.icon" height="19.5"/>For those who recognize an opportunity, they will often find it inefficient to spend time persuading others to take advantage of it, because they need to act quickly to take advantage of it. In particular, the process of persuading those who do not understand may not contribute much to the achievement of objectives, and thus the principle of ‚Äúdo not persuade those who do not need to be persuaded‚Äù is an effective strategy. In these situations, the priority is to focus on the opportunity and to work with colleagues who understand its value.</p>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>What I would like to consider here is that if there is a method that can make ‚Äú<a href="./someone-who-is" class="internal alias" data-slug="someone-who-is">someone who is</a> unaware of opportunities‚Äù into ‚Äú<a href="./someone-who-is" class="internal alias" data-slug="someone-who-is">someone who is</a> aware of opportunities,‚Äù then by using it on yourself, you will become even more aware of opportunities. I want to figure that out. I want to improve my resolution to this phenomenon.</p>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/gpt/icon" alt="gpt.icon" height="19.5"/>The perspective of finding ways to develop ‚Äúopportunity-aware people‚Äù and applying them to oneself <a href="./to-promote-personal-growth" class="internal alias" data-slug="to-promote-personal-growth">to promote personal growth</a> is very interesting. In order to develop this resolution, it is important to first identify the reasons why one is ‚Äúunaware of opportunities‚Äù and to understand the impact of <a href="./cognitive-bias" class="internal alias" data-slug="cognitive-bias">cognitive bias</a> and values. Also, by broadening the scope of our experience and incorporating the perspectives of others, we may be more likely to notice new patterns and possibilities. Conscious training and updating mental models will be key to this process.</p>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>What patterns might be seen in those who fail to recognize opportunities?</p>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/gpt/icon" alt="gpt.icon" height="19.5"/>There may be several common patterns among those who fail to recognize opportunities. They may have the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>1 <a href="./Fixed-thinking" class="internal alias" data-slug="Fixed-thinking">Fixed thinking</a>: when one is closed to new perspectives and information and relies too strongly on past experience and existing knowledge. This makes them blind to new possibilities and changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2 <a href="./risk-aversion" class="internal alias" data-slug="risk-aversion">risk aversion</a> Tendency: avoiding change or trying the unknown for fear of failure, and consequently missing opportunities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3 <a href="./preconceived-notion" class="internal alias" data-slug="preconceived-notion">preconceived notion</a> or <a href="./bias" class="internal" data-slug="bias">bias</a> : Judging things based on one‚Äôs own values and worldview, and therefore not recognizing other options and possibilities. This includes cultural biases and past successes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>4 Insufficient focus of attention: not noticing changes in surrounding information or situations and missing important signs and clues. Busyness and excessive stress can also cause this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>5 Influence of failed experiences: past failures can cause a loss of confidence, and people tend to view new opportunities as risks and lack the willingness to try.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>6 Low self-efficacy: low belief that they can take advantage of changes and opportunities, so they do not take positive action when they become aware of opportunities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Recognizing these patterns and identifying which ones apply to you and others may help improve your ability to seize opportunities.</p>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>5 and 6 are serious <a href="./curse" class="internal" data-slug="curse">curse</a>, but as far as my personal enhancement is concerned, I‚Äôll leave them out of the scope this time because it‚Äôs the opposite. I have a history of success by taking advantage of opportunities, which motivates me when I see an opportunity (5) I act when I see an opportunity because I have a high belief that I can take advantage of the opportunity (6)</p>
<p>1-3 also make sense to me, but I personally don‚Äôt feel this is a new story. 4 is the interesting part, I think. Namely, ‚Äú<a href="./Miss-the-signs-when-you-get-busy." class="internal alias" data-slug="Miss-the-signs-when-you-get-busy.">Miss the signs when you get busy.</a>‚Äù occurs as a result of seeing an opportunity and acting on it.</p>
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/gpt/icon" alt="gpt.icon" height="19.5"/>
The phenomenon of &quot;missing signs when you're busy&quot; is certainly an interesting point. The reason this occurs is that cognitive resources are limited, and in busy situations, attention is divided and important signs may not be captured. One way to address this issue is to reduce one's cognitive load through proper time management, stress management, or by leveraging outside assistance (tools and teams). Making a conscious effort to create &quot;space&quot; and have the luxury of not missing the signs may be important in maintaining the ability to recognize opportunities.
