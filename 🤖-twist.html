<p>Research on “The Engineer’s Art of Intellectual Production” has revealed the need for ambiguous or vector searches to address the problem of information overload. This will enable the discovery of relevant keywords and descriptions and improve knowledge productivity. In addition, the implementation of AI-based story creation in society will promote productive discussion and the democratization of knowledge.</p>
<p>According to Nishio’s research, “Explaining the Intellectual Production Techniques of Engineers with Bing AI,” the intellectual production techniques of engineers enhance learning effectiveness by setting learning objectives, levels, and evaluation criteria, organizing what is learned, and outputting what is learned. In addition, “First, increase personal productivity” states that new ideas are generated by combining knowledge, and new combinations are created by incorporating the different knowledge of others.</p>
<p>These studies show that improved information organization skills are closely related to improved knowledge productivity. They also suggest that collaborative work between AI and humans provides a variety of perspectives and improves knowledge productivity.</p>
<p>However, further research is needed on how exactly to implement these studies in society and how to promote the democratization of knowledge.</p>

AI verbalizes thoughts and fluctuates learning efficiency. Can be coupled with a system that expresses exploratory behavior and allows AI to do so on its own behalf. Can organize discussions, facilitate productive debate, improve information organization, and manage tasks. Collaboration provides diverse perspectives and improves knowledge productivity. A search engine is needed to address the problem of information overload.</p>
<p>Fragment “Diary 2023-08-26” states that AI improves information organization skills by reading “The Intellectual Production Techniques of Engineers. In addition, “Can we apply Scrapbox’s ‘connection discovery support’ function to support connection discovery between different contents?” suggests a method to discover related keywords and descriptions using ambiguous search and vector search. These may contribute to improving AI’s information organization capability and knowledge productivity.</p>
<p>The “Scrapbox+GPT4” proposes to improve intellectual production, democratize knowledge, and automate and streamline the process of AI and human collaboration. These are relevant to how AI can be used and how it can facilitate productive discussions.</p>
<p>In “Intelligent Collaboration Between AI and Humans,” a process is proposed in which AI and humans collaborate and integrate, and in which AI assists humans as a tool. This could contribute to improved knowledge productivity through AI-human collaboration.</p>
<p>In “<a href="./Nodal-Point-of-Thought-2023-02-19" class="internal alias" data-slug="Nodal-Point-of-Thought-2023-02-19">Nodal Point of Thought 2023-02-19</a>,” the authors describe the importance of AI replacing the ability to create stories and implementing this in society. This relates to how AI can be used and improve knowledge productivity.</p>
<p>In light of the above, it is important to deeply consider how AI can be used and how knowledge productivity can be improved. It is also necessary to consider the improvement of knowledge productivity through collaboration between AI and humans.</p>

<p>AI can express its exploratory behavior in words, which can then be coupled with a system that receives them and performs exploratory behavior on its behalf that AI cannot; Keichobot acquires the ability to put thoughts into words, and its learning efficiency varies depending on how it learns; AI organizes discussion traffic and facilitates productive debate; AI can learn to organize information in a way that is more efficient and effective; and AI can learn to organize information in a way that is more efficient and effective. AI also improves its ability to organize information by reading “The Intellectual Production of Engineers.</p>
<p>Nishio’s research notes suggest that AI will manage tasks and that humans will need to find the details and context of tasks and put them into words. In addition, collaboration with AI provides a variety of perspectives to improve knowledge productivity. Furthermore, AI has created search engines to address the problem that it is no longer possible for one person to receive all the information because of the accumulation of past information.</p>

<p>The ability of an AI to verbalize its exploratory behavior is an important step toward performing exploratory behaviors on behalf of humans that they are unable to do. However, it is not yet clear how AI will acquire this capability and how it will use it. In addition, the notion that AI facilitates productive discussions by organizing discussion traffic requires a detailed explanation of how AI organizes discussions and how it makes them productive.</p>
<p>Nishio’s research notes suggest that AI does the task management and that humans need to find and verbalize the details and context of the task. However, further research is needed to determine how AI performs task management and how it can help humans find the details and context of a task.</p>
<p>In addition, the notion that collaboration with AI provides a variety of perspectives to improve knowledge productivity requires a detailed explanation of how AI and humans collaborate and how this improves knowledge productivity.</p>
<p>Finally, the idea that search engines were created to address the problem that AI has accumulated so much information in the past that it has become impossible for any one person to receive all of it, is not a good idea, as a detailed explanation of how AI creates search engines and how they help retrieve information is A detailed explanation is needed.</p>

<p>Keichobot has gained the ability to put thoughts into words through “nerineri” research. Learning efficiency is variable depending on how you learn, innovation is possible with inferior products as well as new technologies, and GPT4 proposed a Next Action to organize traffic in Twitter discussions and make them productive discussions. This relates to the ability to put thoughts into words and organize information. The process of “can’t write” = not enough information → research gathering → write it all down → organizing (deleting and grouping) is critical.</p>
<p>Nishio’s research notes show that ChatGPT now reads and responds to “The Engineer’s Art of Intellectual Production” and that if ChatGPT can express in words the “exploratory behavior” it wants to do, it can be coupled with a system that receives it and returns it by doing the exploratory behavior ChatGPT cannot do instead This is the idea behind the “Neri-Neri” research. This seems to be directly related to the “Nerine” investigation.</p>

The meaning, context, and value of “nerineri” were investigated, and various pieces of information were gleaned from Nishio’s research notes; Keichobot’s contextualization allows thoughts to be put into words through training in using the speaker’s words as they are and not interpreting them arbitrarily; and the GPT4 and the node of thought was asked about the specific meaning, concept and intent behind “Neri Neri”. No direct connection could be found between Dominion’s game strategy and the investigation of “Neri-Neri”. Headings and chapter titles are referred to as “prior organizers” and assist in the organization of information. With regard to learning efficiency, whether more can be learned per unit of time depends on how one learns. Innovation can occur not only with new technologies, but also with products that perform poorly. It is important to use this information to advance the investigation of “Nerinen”.</p>

<p>We conducted a survey of the meaning, context, and value of “neri neri.” We also gleaned information from fragments of Nishio’s research notebooks about Keichobot’s contextualization and thought nodes with GPT4, Dominion’s game strategy, attention to headlines, knowledge and capital theory and the condition of technologists, improving learning efficiency, and understanding innovation.</p>
<p>The lack of specific information on the meaning, context, and value of “neri neri” requires continued investigation. On the other hand, a fragment of Nishio’s research notes provided information on Keichobot’s contextual organization. This is the idea that by being trained to use the speaker’s words as they are and not to interpret them arbitrarily, it is possible to put fuzzy thoughts into words.</p>
<p>Regarding the nodal point of thought with GPT4, there were questions about the specific meaning of “neri neri” and the concept and intent behind it. This could be related to the “nerine” survey.</p>
<p>Regarding the Dominion game strategy, there was information about the effects and strategies of each card, but we could not find any direct relevance to the “Neri Neri” survey.</p>
<p>Regarding attention to headings, there was information that headings and chapter titles are “prior organizers,” appearing before the textual description and helping to organize the information by indicating key words in the following text. This plays an important role in organizing and understanding information.</p>
<p>The knowledge and capital theory and the conditions for technologists need to be continued to be investigated, as no specific information was available.</p>
<p>Regarding learning efficiency, there was information that programmers’ growth is exponential and that they learn more or less per unit of time depending on how they learn. This could help in the exploration of efficient learning methods.</p>
<p>Regarding the understanding of innovation, it was noted that there is a misconception that innovation = new technological advancement. It is important to note that innovation can occur not only with new technologies, but also with products that are inferior in terms of performance.</p>
<p>Based on the above information, it will be important to continue to investigate “nerineri” and use the information to improve Keichobot’s contextual organization, learning efficiency, and understanding of innovation.</p>
