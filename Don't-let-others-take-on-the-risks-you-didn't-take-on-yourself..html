<p>A number of ARAF graduates of unexplored fields say that they are “playing it safe,” “they tend to choose options that could certainly be done successfully,” and “they should try more things that could fail,” after seeing the presentations of the current students’ results in the past few years and so on. I share their sentiments in saying that.</p>
<p>However, I still don’t think it is appropriate for others to tell them to “take more risks. It is the life of the current student creator that is exposed to risk, and others cannot shoulder the burden.</p>
<p>There are people in the world who get angry when others succeed, and get satisfaction by looking for rough edges and dragging them down. When they publish a book, they receive low reviews that seem to indicate that they have not read the contents, and anti-posts are made daily on social networking sites. There is no need to feed these people.</p>
<p>In the days of the ARAF graduates, the debriefing sessions were not recorded and shown on YouTube. In our time, we were angry that “old men who had never started their own businesses were telling young people, ‘By all means, start your own business,’ and ‘If you do, you will definitely succeed,’ etc.” The composition is the same. You should not make others take risks that you did not take yourself. We must not create an “atmosphere” in which it is natural to take such risks. It is the current student who decides whether or not to take the risk, and others can only help them understand the advantages and disadvantages before making the decision.</p>
<p>Alumni who have survived until now may think, “It is the natural order of things that anti-survivors occur, so we need to train ourselves to be able to go through them without worrying about every single one. This is <a href="./survivor-bias" class="internal alias" data-slug="survivor-bias">survivor bias</a>. Only those who have not had their hearts broken by anti-Arapaho attacks, or by the memes of <a href="./imposter-syndrome" class="internal alias" data-slug="imposter-syndrome">imposter syndrome</a> in which people wonder if they are overrated, or by <a href="./Delusion-that-the-world-should-admire-him" class="internal alias" data-slug="Delusion-that-the-world-should-admire-him">Delusion that the world should admire him</a>, remain. The reason that the current alumni are immune to those mental attacks is because of the <a href="./multiple-achievements" class="internal alias" data-slug="multiple-achievements">multiple achievements</a> they have accumulated so far, so they can believe that their value will not be diminished by the attacks. Remember, for many current students, this is “<a href="./the" class="internal" data-slug="the">the</a> first achievement”.</p>

<ul>
<li>Are you arguing that we should stop releasing recordings of results briefings?”</li>
<li>No, it isn’t.
<ul>
<li>I think the release of the recordings themselves is very conducive to raising the level of innovation in Japan. I think it will create more value if it continues.</li>
<li>However, this is for the convenience of the project sponsors, and should not be at the expense of the individual creators who have been selected.</li>
<li>It would be good to make the design of the current recording public as a given constraint, while leaving it up to the individual creator to decide how to make decisions within that context.</li>
</ul>
