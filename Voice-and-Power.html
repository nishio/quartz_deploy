</ul>
<p>There is a common perception of power, especially among those who believe that shouting about “those without power” shouting “give me power,” attracts attention and is effective in solving problems, and those who have power but are considered “those without power” should raise their voices. However, those who have power but are regarded as “powerless ones” believe that they should demonstrate their competence instead of raising their voices. This is because “raising one’s voice” is not a validation of power because even “those without power” can do so.</p>
<p>He also offered the perspective that public opinion may have changed because those who were silent changed their minds to “speaking up might change things for the better.</p>
<p>We also discussed “the power of belief” and “the power of disbelief.” While we should not believe that society is rationally designed, we can believe that there is always a solution to a problem that many ordinary people are solving.</p>
<p>He stated that it is hard to ignore people’s slander and respond with silence. Further research is needed to understand how these factors interact to shape human behavior and thinking.</p>

<p>Power, especially the “powerless ones” shouting “give me power,” was discussed. There is a common perception among those who believe that shouting attracts attention and is effective in solving problems and those who have power but are considered “powerless ones” that they should speak up. However, signals are needed to cut off those who remain silent.</p>
<p>Nishio’s research note, “Speaking Up Might Change Things for the Better,” is relevant to this discussion. The viewpoint that public opinion may have changed because those who were silent have changed to “speaking up may change things for the better” provides a new perspective for our research.</p>
<p>He also discussed the “power to move people. It is important to name this force; Nishio’s note on the “power to move people” is closely related to this discussion.</p>
<p>He also discussed the “power to believe” and the “power not to believe. Nishio’s note on “The Power to Believe and the Power Not to Believe” complements this discussion.</p>
<p>Finally, we discussed the “power of throughness”. It is hard to ignore a person’s slander and respond with silence; Nishio’s note on the “power of throughness” is consistent with this consideration.</p>
<p>These considerations have provided a deep understanding of the elements that influence human behavior and thinking, including power, voice, power to move people, power to believe and not to believe, and power through and through. Further research is needed to understand how these elements interact to shape human behavior and thinking.</p>

<p>power
Shouting
That which has no power cries out, “Give me power!”
Those who cynically call it futile for the “powerless” to cry “give me power!”
People who truly believe that screaming for attention is an effective way to solve problems.
People who have power but are considered “powerless”
Those who believe that it is not necessary to shout strongly to get the public’s attention, but that voices should be raised.
Signals to cut off those who are silent</p>
