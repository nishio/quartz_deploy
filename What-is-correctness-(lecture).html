14 those that already have the correct answer.
The final exam that you are all taking right now.
Entrance exams taken to get into college.
Qualification examinations even after entering the workforce</p>

When you enter a research university to conduct research on something for which there is still no correct answer, there is no correct answer to your research.15 Product DevelopmentThe majority of your life is spent in product development at a company. In product development as well, you launch a product thinking it will sell, but when you launch it, it doesn‚Äôt. In life, you follow the path you think is right. In life, too, we follow what we think is the right path, but only when we die will we know whether or not it was the right path.</p>

16With no way to compare and grade the correct answers, I started worrying about what is ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù then. Well, I didn‚Äôt start worrying about it until I was about 30 years old, so I thought, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you worry about it earlier?</p>

17Correctness can be roughly defined in at least three ways: logical correctness, natural science correctness, and decision-making correctness.</p>
<p><img src="https://gyazo.com/28cffa7e98fa9ba2115f9089341fafe2/thumb/1000" alt="image"/>
18 ! From the axiom correct axiom that we have decided to be correct.
Logically derived that logically correct procedures combined with pure mathematical correctness</p>

<p><img src="https://gyazo.com/5ff4e1c1cbc1e048ddc353d1373bdd20/thumb/1000" alt="image"/>
19 ! From the textbook explanation in the textbook that is supposed to be correct.
Logically derived, if it were a proof problem in mathematics, you would get a circle if you could combine the information from the textbook to form a proof without any logical gaps, and correctness in exam scoring.</p>

20Correctness of Natural Science</p>
<p><img src="https://gyazo.com/9d1d30141ba956b1f54b527997677fb2/thumb/1000" alt="image"/>
21 ‚ÄúExperiments confirmed it!‚Äù Even if you reproduce it by experimenting 100 times, there is nothing logical to say whether it will reproduce the 101st time or not. Specifically, for example, if you catch 100 birds and they all fly, can you conclude that ‚Äúall birds fly‚Äù?</p>
<p><img src="https://gyazo.com/70125daddf4342356da5618bda4288f8/thumb/1000" alt="image"/>
22 By that logic, it would mean that natural science is not correct, and according to the definition of correctness in pure mathematics, it cannot be claimed to be correct.
But if everything that scientists believe to be true is not true‚Ä¶ then scientists are in trouble, so they decided to change the definition of correctness. If you follow the pure mathematical definition of correctness, you cannot claim to be correct</p>
<p><img src="https://gyazo.com/3602e2e20851791bc673cb23d0f16b51/thumb/1000" alt="image"/>
23Correctness in Natural Science! Let‚Äôs just accept the claims that others can disprove and that have not been disproved at this point as correct and proceed with the research. If it is disproved, let‚Äôs say it is not correct. This is how we have changed the definition of correctness. The definition of correctness differs from that of pure mathematics.</p>
<p><a href="./tags/Refutationalism" class="tag-link internal alias" data-slug="tags/Refutationalism">Refutationalism</a></p>
<p><img src="https://gyazo.com/2161bf64a15d1b770004926f3d5be50d/thumb/1000" alt="image"/>
24 Now let‚Äôs think about the correctness of the decision-making process.</p>
<p><img src="https://gyazo.com/a04c94c4bf4e28dbb46bbbf3ab3482be/thumb/1000" alt="image"/>
25To be more specific, was your life choice to enroll in Nada the right one? Was it right? What do you think? There are a lot of people grinning.</p>
<p><img src="https://gyazo.com/d78c90e0b47bb59dc302150922d5de1f/thumb/1000" alt="image"/>
26I should have gone to a co-ed school, it was a mistake to go to a boys‚Äô school‚Ä¶ possibilityI went to engineering at university and out of 90 students there were only 2 women and I never had a chance to talk to any women on a daily basis‚Ä¶maybe I went to a boys‚Äô school? I was in a boys‚Äô school‚Ä¶ I thought, ‚ÄúI must have been in the wrong boys‚Äô school!</p>
<p><img src="https://gyazo.com/39fae4650b698055cca3cf4968a3fa44/thumb/1000" alt="image"/>
27So, let‚Äôs do a control experiment to see if we were right in joining Nada or not, and let‚Äôs decide which one is right based on the happiness level of the one who joined Nada!</p>
<p><img src="https://gyazo.com/a9ad90417e35bd5d90b02b0cfcb69a8f/thumb/1000" alt="image"/>
28And while we‚Äôre at it, let‚Äôs repeat the experiment several times, because one experiment may be a fluke, so let‚Äôs repeat the experiment 10 or 20 times!</p>
<p><img src="https://gyazo.com/6e377f8613b73b96aab06e090cf83cad/thumb/1000" alt="image"/>
29That kind of thing is not possible in life; there is only one timing. You cannot get the results of an experiment on the side where there was no choice. You can no longer verify what life would have been like if you entered a co-ed school now. You can‚Äôt do that.</p>
<p><img src="https://gyazo.com/ce591de6313e9749e7f5f7556b7cca86/thumb/1000" alt="image"/>
In other words, most of life‚Äôs decisions are incorrect, or at least cannot be claimed to be scientifically correct. So what do we do? Well, there must be another definition of correctness, and if we follow the definition of correctness in the natural sciences, we cannot claim to be correct.30</p>
<p><img src="https://gyazo.com/05f7b3967d08dcac5fde99bd8cbccbde/thumb/1000" alt="image"/>
31So how do you define decision correctness?</p>
<p><img src="https://gyazo.com/3b9eb3b4777ebb2de1457dd5f9fbd78b/thumb/1000" alt="image"/>
We have no choice but to decide that Let‚Äôs say we define it this way. I am sure there are many opinions about the correctness of the decision-making process. I will explain what I think is right at this point, so if you have any objections, please write ‚ÄúI think this way‚Äù on the survey form! Whether or not the results of your actions were beneficial to your life</p>
<p><img src="https://gyazo.com/97136b58936cf3dfa65e20c7d5adf0fe/thumb/1000" alt="image"/>
33 So by that definition, it is derived that it is not possible to know the correct answer before an action is taken. It is futile to try to know if the action is correct before the action is taken, and futility, by this definition, is not correct.</p>
<p><img src="https://gyazo.com/e8c6e6ac42a700c62713b863b5f7cce5/thumb/1000" alt="image"/>
34 Also, since the definition includes ‚Äúfor my life‚Äù, it is derived that there is only ‚Äúwhat is right for me‚Äù, which is right for different people. Of everyone here, some will be glad they joined Nada, and some will regret it. It is different for everyone and there is no general right answer.</p>
<p><img src="https://gyazo.com/7f717861ab66745bdbc981ef0e9b2c63/thumb/1000" alt="image"/>
35It is easy to get stuck trying to get the universally correct answer before acting, and yet we tend to seek the right answer. For example, if you are interested in a woman, is it better to give her roses or sweets? This metaphor may not be clear to many people. For example, when choosing a university, would Kyoto University or Tokyo University be better, would it be better to go abroad, or would it be better to take a leave for a year and go around the world to gain social experience before entering university, etc. Opinions are useless because there is no right answer before action, and rightness does not coincide with others.</p>
