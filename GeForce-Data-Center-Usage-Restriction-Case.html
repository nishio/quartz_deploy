<li>This change is not about a purchase agreement, but about a license agreement.</li>
<li>A clause was added to the contract prohibiting its use in certain circumstances (in data centers).</li>
<li>As a result, Company A is no longer able to use its own GeForce in certain situations</li>
<li>NVIDIA insists that you use their other product, which is about 10 times more expensive, if you want to use it in certain situations.</li>
<li>It is not easy to replace hardware made by other companies. This is because the software development environment for using that hardware is proprietary.

<li>In such a case, “If KT makes a request, etc. that is extremely disadvantageous to Paygate, but Paygate has no choice but to accept it, because the difficulty of continuing business with KT would be a major obstacle to the management of Paygate.</li>
<li>“We will comprehensively consider the degree of dependence of JQA on KT, KT’s position in the market, the possibility of a change in JQA’s business partners, and other specific facts that indicate the necessity of doing business with KT.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Claim A does not appear to “consider the totality of the specific facts” in this case.</p>
<p>As per the above facts</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unique software development environment to use the hardware, which prevents easy migration to other companies’ products.
It is clear that if it becomes difficult to continue business transactions due to the</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, NVIDIA’s market position and the need to do business is described in the words of TechCrunch as follows:.
(It would be nice to have numerical data, so please let me know if you know.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is now an indispensable source of hardware for many companies, especially startups that are trying to use artificial intelligence.
Nvidia’s cards are essential for a model that uses vast amounts of data and processes it efficiently on the fly.
Nvidia says “GPU computing in data centers has almost tripled year over year. This is an important indicator for Nvidia’s future. The company is certainly the leader (at least for now) in supplying the hardware that deep learning requires.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, by combining the above facts with the argument up to this point in Claim A, NVIDIA’s conduct constitutes an “unfair trade practice”.</p>
<p>So far I have looked at claim A and thought about the route of using the Unfair Competition Prevention Act. The author would like to consider the route of using the Civil Code, but for now, I will disclose it here so far.</p>
<hr/>
<p>There are two types of damages: damages for default (Article 415) and damages for tort (Article 709), but I don’t think we can go so far as to say that “NVIDIA had promised to allow the data center to continue to use it” in this case, so I will focus on damages for tort.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Chapter V Torts
(Damages for tortious behavior)
Article 709 Any person who intentionally or negligently infringes the rights or legally protected interests of another shall be liable for damages resulting therefrom.
requirement</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>1: Intentionally or through negligence</li>
<li>2: Infringement on the rights or legally protected interests of others
effect</li>
<li>liable to compensate for damages incurred</li>
</ul>
<p>The act of “adding a clause prohibiting use in a data center” is clearly intended to intentionally prevent “use in a data center.” Therefore, requirement 1 is satisfied. The issue is whether “use in the data center” was a right or legally protected interest of Company A.</p>
<p>I’m still trying to sort it all out, but here’s the zap.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is common business practice to assume that when an object is bought or sold, the buyer may use the object.</li>
<li>When a purchase or sale of an object was made, software essential to the use of that object was licensed free of charge.</li>
<li>At the time the sale was consummated, NVIDIA did not prohibit the use of its software in the data center.
<ul>

<p><a href="./Notice" class="internal" data-slug="Notice">Notice</a> The use of GeForce/TITAN-based products in data centers has long been non-guaranteed. In that sense, we have refused to use them for data centers or cloud services, but this does not preclude their use in university laboratories, etc. The latest NVIDIA TITAN V presented at NIPS is also an ideal product for HPC and deep learning.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As for “no guarantee for use at the data center,” it is generally accepted that “no guarantee” is a different concept from “prohibition,” and is interpreted to mean “not actively guaranteed, but available for use at your own risk.</li>
<li>In fact, in Article 6.1 of the license, NVIDIA itself expressly states that it “makes no warranty of any kind. If one were to argue that “no warranty means prohibition,” then this license would have prohibited any use.
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>6.1 No Warranties. to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the software is provided “as is” and nvidia and its suppliers disclaim all warranties of any nature or kind, whether express, implied or statutory, relating to or arising out of the software, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and noninfringement. NVIDIA and its suppliers disclaim all warranties of any nature or kind, whether express, implied, statutory, or otherwise, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement.</p>

</li>
<li>Buyers naturally think “I can use what I buy in the data center”.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To revise the license of software that is essential for the use of the thing after the purchase agreement has been executed, and to prevent the use of the thing, would undermine the benefit of “being able to use the thing” that the buyer anticipated at the time of the purchase agreement.</li>
<li>This interest should be legally protected.

<li>factual arrangement
<ul>
<li>The tangible “PS3” has a purchase agreement and ownership has already been transferred from Sony to each individual.</li>
<li>Updates were distributed for software running inside the PS3 <a href="http://www.jp.playstation.com/info/support/sp_20100329_ps3.html" class="external">official announcement<svg aria-hidden="true" class="external-icon" style="max-width:0.8em;max-height:0.8em;" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><path d="M320 0H288V64h32 82.7L201.4 265.4 178.7 288 224 333.3l22.6-22.6L448 109.3V192v32h64V192 32 0H480 320zM32 32H0V64 480v32H32 456h32V480 352 320H424v32 96H64V96h96 32V32H160 32z"></path></svg></a>.
<ul>
<li>The claim is that this is a response to problems caused by security vulnerabilities.
<ul>
<li>Apparently there was a reference to “content piracy” in the courtroom. (Hearsay)</li>
<li>By installing an operating system such as Linux, the company attempted to destroy the possibility of infringing the copyright of the content by using its functions (interpretation).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Application of this update was optional.</li>
<li>However, if the update is not adapted, access to the PlayStation Network will be impossible, making it impossible to play games online, for example.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sony is much better off in this case than in the NVIDIA case (subjective opinion of the author).</li>
<li>It is possible to “install Linux or other software” and “pirate content through it” on a PS3 before the update, and it makes sense to try to stop piracy of the latter.</li>
<li>However, the fact that they stopped “installing Linux and other software” as a means of doing so was seen as problematic.</li>
<li>The removal of “the ability to install Linux and other software” from a PS3 after transfer of ownership constituted “infringement of another person’s rights or legally protected interests” and damages were to be awarded.
<ul>
<li>(Of course, this case is U.S. law, so the text is different.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, think about how you would argue if you were on NVIDIA’s side.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sure, we made a deal to sell GeForce, but that only gives you ownership of the thing.
<ul>
<li>I don’t care if it works or not.</li>
<li>You just made the wrong decision when you bought it because you thought it was something you could use.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Device drivers are my property, and I am free to decide under what conditions I want to license them.
<ul>
<li>If you are dissatisfied, don’t use it.</li>
<li>Just because at this point in time (with no incentive for other companies to develop them by providing them free of charge) you have only one choice of device drivers, there is no reason why you should have to use it. If you are dissatisfied with the contents of the license agreement, you can make your own device drivers or buy them from other suppliers (which are not available).
<ul>
<li>I feel like they are taking advantage of their 100% monopoly position regarding device drivers on GeForce…</li>
<li>The scorched-earth strategy of free distribution is what created that monopoly position.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hmmm, the “if you’re not happy, make your own devadora” theory makes a certain amount of sense.
<ul>
<li>Except from an antitrust perspective.</li>
<li>Given the PS3 case, NVIDIA’s side of the argument appears to be unfavorable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Summary so far</p>
<ul>
<li>I support the position that the legally protected interest is being intentionally harmed, but I guess I’ll have to let the courts decide.</li>
<li>It would be good if Company A sued, saying, “You should compensate us because the unavailability of GeForce caused damages equivalent to the cost of purchasing GeForce and the profits of the business that had been earned by using GeForce in the GeForce data center.
<ul>
<li>Pointing out that Article 3 of the license is obnoxious.</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>defensive suspension. If you initiate or participate in any legal proceeding against NVIDIA, NVIDIA may, in its sole discretion, suspend or terminate all licenses and all other rights granted under this License during the pendency of such legal proceeding. NVIDIA may suspend or terminate all licenses and all other rights granted under this License at its sole discretion during the pendency of such legal proceedings.</p>

<ul>
<li>The copyright holder does not occupy the right to use the software, so there is no right to demand an injunction.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the user can claim damages for the user’s continued use of the old license, can the user apply to the court for a stay of use with the goal of preventing further damages?”
<ul>
<li>First, in order to be able to claim damages, the user’s act of using the old license must be a tort.</li>
<li>The issue is whether the user is undermining a benefit that deserves legal protection on the part of NVIDIA.</li>
<li>According to the Law Encyclopedia, the principle in Japan is to make a claim for damages after the fact, and the right to demand an injunction is only granted on a limited basis by individual laws. Therefore, there is no right to demand an injunction in this case.</li>
