*1382844642* I read &quot;Zero Fighter: A Record of Its Birth and Glory&quot;.
I read &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/4041006236/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=247&amp;creative=7399&amp;creativeASIN=4041006236&amp; linkCode=as2&amp;tag=nishiohirokaz-22&quot;>The Zero fighter plane: a record of its birth and glory&lt;/a>&quot;.

It is a story about the Navy's insistence that they make a fighter plane that is fast, can fly long distances, and has good maneuverability, and the ingenuity and ingenuity that went into trying to make it work. After the plane was pretty much finished, some people started saying, &quot;Maybe that policy isn't right. Once the product is completed, the quality of the design conception and implementation is proven. Those of us who live and work in the field of technology should not be concerned about baseless speculation or light-hearted criticism. It is very cool to say, &quot;The waves of long-term progress are not to be misjudged. As an engineer, I can really sympathize with him when he introduces novel ideas to reduce weight or performs crunchy tuning to reduce weight as much as possible.

The engineering layer of the story was interesting, but what impressed me the most was the story of the higher layers. In the beginning, a pilot dies in an accident and people are all blue and blue saying, &quot;Fatty is dead,&quot; but at the end of the day, it is treated like a pile of vegetables, &quot;Hundreds of trained pilots died in the great defeat at Midway.

In the early stages, the Zero fighter itself had overwhelming performance, but the bauxite and oil procurement routes were blocked, the U.S. acquired a nearly intact Zero fighter, etc. As a result, the enemy side developed counter-Zero fighter know-how such as &quot;Don't fight one-on-one against the Zero fighter; fight with two of them covering your back,&quot; &quot;Dive from a high altitude and As a result, the enemy side developed the know-how to fight against the Zero fighters, such as &quot;Don't fight one-on-one against the Zero fighters. Toward the end of the war, the U.S. began mass-producing the F6F under the banner of &quot;defeating the Zero fighter,&quot; and the Japanese successor planes were not yet completed due to lack of resources. The Japanese Successor began to add defenses to its fighter planes, which had been designed to be &quot;safe as long as you don't get hit&quot; by adding fuel tanks, bulletproof equipment, automatic fire extinguishers, etc., bombing of the mainland became popular, the people were forced to contribute metal to build as many planes as possible, and kamikaze suicide attacks were launched using the precious fighters that were created in this way...

And in the midst of this trend, Mr. Horikoshi is unable to do anything to change it. The gap between the first half of the book, where he builds the world's best fighter jet with his own resourcefulness, and the second half, where he is unable to do anything, is wearing.

*1382848543* I read &quot;An Introduction to Anti-Philosophy&quot;.
I read &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/4101320810/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=247&amp;creative=7399&amp;creativeASIN=4101320810&amp; linkCode=as2&amp;tag=nishiohirokaz-22&quot;>Introduction to Anti-Philosophy&lt;/a>&quot;.

This book was compiled by an editor who asked the author, a philosopher, verbatim. The author was concerned about &quot;the same content coming up over and over again,&quot; but was told by the editor that &quot;it is rather easy to understand what is important over and over again,&quot; which he found to be true. There's a similar thing in mathematics. I think that important things should be written more than once, but for some reason I think about making the same content appear only once, and then I worry about the order of the story.

Well, that aside, the orally summarized portions of the book are very readable.

There are two ways of thinking about the philosophical question, &quot;Why do things exist? Both Japan and ancient Greece believed that things come into being and &quot;become&quot; naturally. Judaism, on the other hand, held the belief that the Creator made the world.

Socrates repeatedly denied the existing Greek philosophy, but did not create a new system himself. His disciple Plato, perhaps under the influence of Judaism, believed that an ideal &quot;Idea&quot; existed and that the real world was &quot;made&quot; in the image of it. After Plato, this idea of &quot;making&quot; became a strong force in Europe. One reason for this may be that Christianity used the framework of &quot;nature&quot; and &quot;the transcendent who created it&quot; for its own theoretical armamentarium.

In Descartes, too, the idea is that a transcendent who has changed the form of &quot;reason&quot; creates the world by &quot;thinking,&quot; so it is a continuation of the ground. At the time, Galileo was being put on trial for religion, so it was dangerous to contradict the Church's idea. The idea was that human reason was correct because it was &quot;guarded by divine reason.

A century or two after Descartes, Kant thought that we should get rid of the &quot;guardianship of divine reason&quot;. This is what he meant by &quot;What is enlightenment? It is to get out of the underage state that man has brought on himself. A minor is a state in which one cannot use one's own reason without the guidance of others. The &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot; is not to say that God is right because of reason, but to consider how much can be said by pure reason alone, and what is too much to say.

So, Nietzsche said that various philosophies after Plato have all dragged Plato's idea in that &quot;transcendent beings exist because they are created by transcendent beings,&quot; and that this is not right. His first study was &quot;The History of the Formation of Greek Tragedy,&quot; and in the process he had the opportunity to come into contact with pre-Plato thought. At the time, Darwin's theory of evolution was emerging, and some thought that if organisms change themselves to adapt to their environment, then human cognitive functions must have &quot;come into being&quot; to adapt to their environment as well.

He believed that the &quot;will to power&quot; to &quot;be stronger or greater&quot; was the reason why existence &quot;became&quot; as it is. He did not need to posit a transcendent being such as &quot;God&quot; or &quot;Reason,&quot; and &quot;God is dead&quot; is a catchy expression of that idea.

After this, we talked about Heidegger and Nazism, and then about Husserl, whom the author loves, but it seems that the author started to add more and more things to the conversation, and it became difficult to understand the details of the conversation. I am sorry to say that the story is now finished. Since I had read the book in e-book format, I did not feel that there were only a few pages left, and I was very surprised because it was written as if it was still in the middle of the story.

So even though I don't know much about Heidegger and Husserl, the book was very easy to follow up to Nietzsche.

Last time I read Kitaro Nishida's &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/4000015656/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=247&amp;creative=7399&amp;creativeASIN= 4000015656&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=nishiohirokaz-22&quot;>Introduction to Philosophy&lt;/a>&quot; by Kitaro Nishida. Next up was Yoshimichi Nakajima's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/4061594818/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=247&amp;creative=7399&amp;creativeASIN= 4061594818&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=nishiohirokaz-22&quot;>Textbook of Philosophy&lt;/a>&quot; by Yoshimichi Nakajima.
