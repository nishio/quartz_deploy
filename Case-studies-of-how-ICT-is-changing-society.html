-Cybozu internally emphasizes the distinction between fact and interpretation.
-It is true that there are people who interpret ‚ÄúJapanese companies are not able to create platforms‚Äù in this way.
-Gartner interpreted ‚ÄúCybozu is one of the 14 major vendors that make the Platform‚Äù. It is true that they are publicly announcing this.
-Whether you are in fact creating a Platform depends on the definition of Platform. I am not going to argue. I will present concrete facts.</p>

Incentives are needed 50
-Mouthing the words, ‚ÄúWe need data,‚Äù doesn‚Äôt make data collection go any further, because it‚Äôs more work.
-If eight hours of work is reduced to a fraction of a second and work is reduced, then people will spend more time collecting data.

This year‚Äôs new employees write about various things on a daily basis, and other employees comment and ‚Äúlike‚Äù them.</p>
<p>I was in Cybozu Office on April 3, 2007 at 16:55.
I created a place (bulletin board) called ‚ÄúNishio‚Äôs own thing‚Äù and started to write various things on my own.</p>

Thought experiment: communicating information to a large group of people 62</p>
<p>Large-scale organized agriculture was practiced in Mesopotamia around 3500 BC.</p>
<p>Mesopotamia uses a lunar calendar, and the calendar and seasons do not correspond well.</p>
<p>In order for a large number of farmers to sow their seeds at the correct time
We need to get information from people who can observe astronomy to a large number of farmers. How can we do this?</p>

Thought experiment: communicating information to a large group of people 63</p>
<p>Information and communication technology was not well developed at that time, and communication by <a href="./a-flesh-and-blood-person" class="internal alias" data-slug="a-flesh-and-blood-person">a flesh-and-blood person</a> was the main method,
The amount of information that a human being can process in a unit of time was the bottleneck of communication.</p>
<p>To make it easier to understand what this situation brings
Let‚Äôs take the constraint to the extreme and assume that ‚Äúone person can only interact with four people‚Äù.</p>
<p>How can information be communicated to a large number of people under these conditions?</p>

Role assignment by hierarchy 65
A) Those who decide ‚Äúwhat to do‚Äù (when, what and how to do it)
B) Those who tell you exactly what they ‚Äúdo‚Äù.
C) People who do exactly what they are ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù to do.</p>

Improved information transfer 66
Right now I‚Äôm communicating to about 50 people.
Gathering at the same place at the same time allows for more efficient communication than talking to each person individually.</p>
<p>Even ancient Rome used to communicate information through speeches.
Microphones and speakers allow the message to be conveyed to an even greater number of people.
Adolf Hitler could reach more than 1,000 people by using a microphone.</p>

Eliminate location restrictions 67</p>
<p>You don‚Äôt have to be in the same place if you relay the video.</p>
<p>Cybozu has offices in Osaka and Shanghai, though,
Monthly company-wide events can be video-streamed and viewed from remote locations.</p>
<p>Historically, synchronous media without location restrictions came in the form of radio and television, and then the dramatic decrease in communication costs due to the Internet made it possible to broadcast video without a TV station.</p>
<p><img src="https://gyazo.com/d77a9a33ae3175495015988cea0ecf2f/thumb/1000" alt="image"/>
Eliminate time limits 68</p>
<p>If you put the videos on a server, you can watch them whenever you want.</p>
<p>The ‚Äúat the same time‚Äù constraint is also eliminated. Communication is possible even when times do not coincide.</p>
<p>Moreover, it accumulates.</p>
<p>Of course, before the video servers, there were forms of posting ‚Äúgochisho,‚Äù which used text, and extra newspapers.</p>

Lower cost of information dissemination 69
-Video broadcasts are expensive in terms of equipment and manpower, but low-cost in terms of information dissemination through text.
-Information dissemination increases by creating a place where anyone can disseminate information without complicated procedures.
-The proliferation of smartphones with cameras makes it easy to attach photos and videos.</p>

Summary so far 70
Hierarchical organization was beneficial in communicating information on a large scale in situations where information and communication technology was not yet developed.
Advances in information and communication technology have lowered the cost of information transmission and dissemination.</p>

Is it normal?„ÄÄ 71</p>
<p>I was a college student in 2000,
Students had group chats with each other via the Internet and would discuss late into the night before reports were due.</p>
<p>I suspect that today‚Äôs students are also using some tool to distribute similar information.</p>
<p>These information distribution tools were commonplace when people who are 20 years old now can remember.</p>
<p>I was ICQ and Yahoo Messenger, but now it‚Äôs Line or Slack?</p>

Other departments are far away</p>
<p><img src="https://gyazo.com/90dc0fc0af2c58928ab97965f3c7e5e6/thumb/1000" alt="image"/>
Job Rotation 81
The old way of dealing with this problem was job rotation.
Regularly change workplaces and duties.
This allows for human networking with other departments.</p>

Concept of Access Rights 82</p>
<p>Why can‚Äôt I have access to the information in the department next door?</p>
<p>The time when information was shared on paper,
If some of the information was not allowed to be shown to other departments, we had no choice but to prohibit access to all of it.</p>
<p>In the digital age, with access rights,
Only some parts of information that cannot be shown can be partially hidden.</p>
<p><img src="https://gyazo.com/ffcb40513786c08797ce9b83a0881416/thumb/1000" alt="image"/>
Access rights 83</p>
<p>Only a portion of the data can be made public or private.
To use a crude analogy, stick Google Spreadsheet on Google Forms,
It is like being able to set accessibility for people and departments for columns and rows.

-Only the ‚Äúnot-to-be-seen‚Äù parts are hidden by setting access rights.

The Value of ‚ÄúUnexpected Combination‚Äù 88
-If you search without narrowing your subject with preconceived notions, you will get surprising information.
-It‚Äôs hard to make these kinds of surprising discoveries when the information system is confined to a specific department.
-by hiding only ‚Äúwhat needs to be hidden‚Äù and disclosing the rest to the entire company,
The distribution of information across departments is encouraged and creates value.</p>

Casual information dissemination 89</p>
<p>-To promote the distribution of ‚Äúinformation that does not need to be seen but can be seen,
Encouraging information dissemination - by having new employees write daily reports.
Make it a matter of course to ‚Äúsend out daily messages to the entire company on the groupware.</p>
<p>-by creating a place where you are allowed to write your own words,
Feel free to send out your thoughts company-wide - you never know in advance what will be useful later.
So encourage and encourage transmission regardless of content.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you make it a rule that you must get permission from your supervisor before posting company-wide.
Casual information dissemination dies easily. Even if it is possible with tools, it dies with rules.</p>
<p><img src="https://gyazo.com/779f4bb27206760f70c643e5b6f891ad/thumb/1000" alt="image"/>
Summary so far 90
Rules need to advance as tools advance
-Management that does not make the assumption that ‚Äúwe gather in the same place 8 hours a day‚Äù.
-Revealing all but the information that really needs to be hidden, rather than ‚Äúall together private‚Äù.
-encourages casual information dissemination

Multiple departments 91</p>
<p>-The casual dissemination of the work of other departments makes it easier for ‚Äúhidden needs‚Äù to be discovered*.
-Easy to devote time to solving that need because it is not an ‚Äú8-hour-a-day premise‚Äù.
Multiple departments are more likely to be concurrently assigned to the same department.</p>
<p>*For example, a task that takes a full day every week in the accounting department may be viewed by an engineer in the development department as something that could be automated if he/she spent a day on it.
However, it is difficult for the accounting department to estimate the level of difficulty of that automation task, so it is difficult to make a formal request. ‚ÜíAppendix C</p>

<p>The transmission of a single input to a large number of people (left figure) is being replaced by information and communication technology,

<p><img src="https://gyazo.com/b3f735e7bebc427baa16af7bde1d2b67/thumb/1000" alt="image"/>
Remaining needs 121</p>
<p>-Summarize many inputs to produce fewer outputs</p>
<p>-Understand the situation of the recipient of information and extract ‚Äúinformation necessary for the recipient.</p>
<p>-Language of ‚Äúinformation that has not yet been verbalized‚Äù is created through questions and observations,
These distribution-enabling needs have not been technically solved and will become increasingly important in the future.</p>

<p>However, the person you tell may not always be your boss.</p>
<p>The increase in working across departments draws out information from Department A,
More needs to be summarized and communicated to department B.</p>
