The 4th edition has begun!</p>
<p>Very interesting from the beginning
The starting point for the presentation was to “rethink living and built space” and “rethink buildings as artifacts” and to see if there is anything we can learn from buildings in nature!

<li>The purpose of this research is to observe all “<a href="./nests" class="internal" data-slug="nests">nests</a>” constructed by non-human life forms in the global environment, to capture and abstract their generation methods, ecology, and construction methods, and to explore construction methods in the age of demolition architecture.</li>
<li>To define the difference between the nests of living creatures and human architecture, we will organize the primitiveness of architecture and the types of nests of living creatures.</li>
<li>Organize the genealogy of organic and bio-theoretical architecture and consider its relationship to the nest of living things.</li>
<li>From an ecological perspective, we will analyze the construction methods of living creatures’ nests and make comparisons with human building practices.</li>
<li>The technology of building nests of living creatures can be treated as equivalent to human architecture because it is not the result of a genetic program but the materialization of cumulative selection, cultural transmission, and homeostasis.</li>
<li>Create a map of changes in the material state of living creatures and compare and discuss with human building production.</li>
<li>The goal is to find the intersection of environmental humanities and architecture, and to apply it to the study of demolition architecture.</li>

<p>It reminds me of the saying, “What an individual has created is as much an expression of its genes as the individual itself.”
“That’s the beaver dams and spider webs we’re talking about, isn’t it?”
“I wish they would say it was a coral reef created by coral worms.”</p>

<li>Animals also use tools (crows, chimpanzees, etc.), so I wondered if the difference between living organisms and humans might be that humans are actively expanding their own bodies (glasses, smartphones, internet) without the need for generational change, and that the span of such expansion is by far the shortest. I thought.

<li>By learning from the nests of organisms the primitive adaptive value of not leaping to advanced architecture, there can be architecture as an ecological niche in our society, and organisms minimize supply monkey by not leaping. (Based on FEP)
Humans, on the other hand, form hypotheticals and constantly modify their environment, so there is a cost of adapting all the time (the need for a non-functionalist white cube).

- Audrey Tang and Glen Weyl are co-writing the Plurality book, which will be completed in March 2024. Open source book.
- Audrey Tang is the Digital Minister of Taiwan. Glen Weyl proposed a mechanism for social change.
- The exchange style theory of Yukito Karatani is the ideological background of this project. We aim for an &quot;X&quot; that overcomes modes of exchange A, B, and C, which correspond to community, state, and market.
- Plurality overcomes the trade-off between depth and breadth of cooperation with technology and aims to recover the exchange style A at a higher order.
- The Plural Management Protocol (PMP) is a concrete proposal that addresses the challenges of OSS project management.
- PMP combines Quadratic Voting and Quadratic Funding to achieve dynamic distribution of authority based on contributions.
- The Plurality project itself has adopted PMP and is a test bed.

<p>question
Q: If one person contributes so much, won’t the credits be concentrated on that person, creating a dictatorship?
A: When an open source project is launched, one person has everything, and the direction is to start from the extremes and move to a decentralized state.</p>
<p>Q: I’d really like to incorporate this into my organization, but I already have a somewhat established organization, and I’m just starting out, so I think I’ll be fine, but how do you go about introducing this in the middle of a project?
A: When introducing PMP in the middle of an existing organization, one option is to start by evaluating each member’s contribution up to that point and assigning credit, for example, “10% for you, 30% for you, 50% for you”. Challenging, however, since no one has tried it before, and the results are unknown.</p>
<p>Q: PMP seems to work well for open source projects, but when introduced to actual companies, the vision of the president and the vision of those who take the initiative in terms of code development contributions will become misaligned, and the president will not be able to achieve his/her goals.
A: If a PMP is implemented in a corporation, it is possible that the vision of the CEO and the intentions of the contributors will clash. How to apply it in a corporation, especially with the existing governance structure of a joint-stock company, is a difficult question, and if it works, it would be an interesting case study!</p>

<li>As for the last story, what happens if they are not diametrically opposed or if their intentions change midstream?
teatwo</li>
<li>In addition to running a company that requires a coherent top-down vision, I wondered what happens when code owners are divided into narrow and deep specialists for each component in the same OSS repository, rather than a book where everyone seems to be able to judge the same subject.
Shoji</li>
<li>Then, I think we can land on the conclusion that change is inherently natural, don’t you think? The means to an end changes.</li>
<li>I think that if the community has enough voting power to cancel the actions of those in power who change the objectives themselves, then there is no problem.</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>What happens when code owners split into narrow and deep specialists for each component?</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>It’s not a second opinion, but if we can keep them as replaceable and ready to be cancelled by the community at any time, then the specialty department itself would not be a problem.</li>
<li>Conversely, I have the impression that it would be difficult without a certain degree of competitive environment and economic incentives.
teatwo</li>
<li>This is an example of a huge repository, but it is an example of a peer reviewer who is too specialized to be assigned to a peer reviewer. If there is an economic incentive, there may be a use case of a training program to nurture alternative candidates!

- Ken Suzuki's &quot;[[Information Theoretic Fusion of Money, Possession, and Voting]]&quot; is becoming a familiar sight in the cryptocurrency and Web3 communities.
- The decentralized social networking protocols Nostr and Farcaster have attracted a lot of attention; Nostr is favored by the Bitcoin community and Farcaster by the Ethereum community.
- A throwaway &quot;Zap&quot; system using the Lightning Network is underway at Nostr, and a reward system using erc-20 tokens is underway at Farcaster.
- Vitalik Buterin mentions &quot;voting&quot; in the decision-making process in decentralized SNSs: Community Notes in X and Uniswap are examples.
- Farcaster's killer feature, Frames, is a framework tool that allows you to deploy apps on social networking sites. Predictive markets and more are popular.
- Nostr, in the Bitcoin community, decisions are not made quickly, and the conference is primarily a &quot;festival&quot; event.
- While there is an illusion that information and economics approaches can solve the problem, there is also a need for speculation outside the political and economic system.
- Distributed social networking is Twitter/X-based at this time, with many hedging applications.
- As the human body and mind are connected to the Internet in the future, decentralized social networking sites provide a good example of a peek into the convergence of social networking and money.

<li>2: The importance of integrating an artistic approach with collective decision-making mechanisms was discussed. It was explained that art is a means of expressing past events and what is important to us.</li>
<li>3: The view was expressed that the development of AI will force us to rely on AI for decision making in the future. On the other hand, it was also pointed out that there is a danger if AI comes to have its own objective function.</li>
<li>4: In the short term, it was suggested that AI be used to help voters make decisions and to expand channels for the state to capture diverse voices.</li>
<li>5: It was stated that the purpose of democracy is to achieve universal human rights, and the view was expressed that in the future it will be necessary to consider the rights of artificial beings, including AI.</li>
<li>6: The relationship between AI and politics was discussed, with the possibility of AI or virtualization of politicians. Former President Trump’s words and actions were compared to an AI outburst.
As mentioned above, a wide range of topics were discussed, including identity, art, and human rights, with a focus on the impact of AI developments on democracy.</li>

    - [[blockchain]] becomes [[super background relations]] as a technology of background relations, and [[multinaturalization]] enables [[multiculturalism]].
- After the collapse of [[liberal democracy]] in the 21st century, [[meta-utopia]] (coexistence of multiple utopias) advocated by [[Robert Nozick]] is aimed for in the 22nd century.
- A meta-utopia can be realized by transitioning from [[World Creator]](Author) to [[World Weaving]]([[Prophet]]) based on the blockchain.
- The prophet will be a [[leftist populist]], with a mission to create a new migration utopia.
- The blockchain, a non-transcendentalist standpoint of the living world based on computational hermeneutics and post-phenomenology, makes possible a multi-naturalistic meta-utopia, which the prophets of [[meta-left populism]] will create.

- [[Accelerationism]] is an ideology that seeks to destroy capitalism and technology by accelerating it, originating at the University of Warwick, England, in 1995.
- Accelerationism is based on historical changes since the late 20th century, such as [[the globalization of markets]], [[the defeat of communism]], [[the failure of space exploration]], and the advent of the [[Anthropocene]].
    - Anthropocene: a new geologic era in which human activity has had a significant impact on the global environment.
- Accelerationism developed in parallel with [[speculative realism]]. Both critique the philosophical tradition known as &quot;[[correlativism]]&quot; after Kant.
    - Thoughtful realism: a modern philosophical position that recognizes a reality independent of human consciousness and cognition.
    - Correlativism: the mainstream of modern philosophy since Kant that does not recognize a reality independent of human consciousness and cognition.
- The failure of the leftist movement to present an effective alternative to capitalism is also behind the accelerationism.
- Accelerationism is oriented toward &quot;[[post-capitalism]]&quot; that overcomes capitalism from within capitalism. Requirements for this include [[full automation of production]], [[reduction of working days]], provision of [[basic income]], and [[reduction of work ethic]].
- Today, Accelerationism splits into various factions. [[neo-rationalism]], [[leftist accelerationism]], [[unconditional accelerationism]], [[xenofeminism]], and [[neo-reactionism]].
    - Xenofeminism: Feminism that aims to free people from gender restrictions through technological advances

- Market globalization: A phenomenon in which markets are liberalized and integrated on a global scale, and people, goods, money, and information move across national borders.
- Defeat of Communism: The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 effectively eliminated the communist camp as a counterweight to capitalism.
- Failure of space exploration: after the space race of the 1960s, enthusiasm for space exploration cooled and humans were unable to expand their sphere of activity beyond Earth.
- Post-capitalism: the next social system that overcomes capitalism. Accelerationism assumes that it will emerge from within capitalism.
- Full automation of production: the complete automation of production activities, replacing human labor with machines or AI.
- Reducing the number of working days: technological advances should significantly reduce the number of working hours.
- Basic income: A system that provides all citizens with an unconditional minimum income that guarantees a minimum standard of living.
- Reduction of work ethic: Relativizing the &quot;work = good&quot; ethic and reducing dependence on work.
- Neo-rationalism: a position that reconfigures the modern concept of rationality and reconnects the concepts of enlightenment, rationality, progress, and scientific inquiry.
- Left Accelerationism: a position that implements the perceptions gained by neo-rationalism in the political economy dimension and expands the leftist camp in technology.
- Unconditional Accelerationism: a position that brackets the political dimension and reanalyzes the concepts of capitalism and acceleration in metaphysical terms.
- Neo-Reactionism: A position, represented by Nick Rand, that calls for the dismantling of democracy and the demand for absolute freedom. It is positioned as the most extreme of the Accelerationist positions.
