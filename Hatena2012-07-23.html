*1343017326*Diary of trying Gunosy
I don't have high expectations for recommendation engines. Or rather, I think the public expects too much. A recommendation engine is not a magic wand. If you don't put in good data, you won't get good results, and if you put in garbage data, you will get garbage.

That is why I have never been interested in &quot;recommendations of articles that might be of interest to you,&quot; but the other day I learned about a service called Gunosy. This approach is to use posts on Twitter and other social media as data for estimating my interests.

>>
Gunosy is a smart personal magazine that analyzes your interests based on your Twitter, Facebook, and Hatena accounts and recommends news and articles that match your interests.
&lt;&lt;
http://gunosy.com/


Of course, not only that, but we will also use data on which articles are viewed to improve recommendations.
>>
Gunosy learns which articles you are looking at and improves its algorithm; the more you use Gunosy, the smarter Gunosy gets to recommend articles for you.
&lt;&lt;

With recommendations that only do the latter, the recommendations are junk when you first access the site, so you will be disappointed and stop using it immediately. So I think the approach of &quot;using the services you already use and the data you have accumulated&quot; is very correct. So, what kind of recommendations would you make if I fed you my Twitter comments? I was curious, so I immediately registered.

(The list of recommended content that was posted here has been moved to the end of the page)

** Summary

It is hard to evaluate quantitatively how much of a benefit it was, but at least it seemed to have a higher density of good information than the Hatena Bookmark top page, Google News, or Twitter timeline. In the future, when I feel like looking at the Twitter TL, I will look at this one first.

** Recommended content

Below is what I was recommended for on the 22nd and the 23rd.

-- You are indeed reading Tweet to understand that I was interested in JSX. Unfortunately, I'm not interested anymore.

-- Hmmm.

- The first step is to change the way we think... 12 Automatic Thoughts We're Prone to : Lifehacker

-- I just realized that although I post my own lifehacks, I'm not really interested in the lifehack information posted by others, because there is too much of it, and the cost of filtering it is not worth it. I'm not really interested in the lifehack information that other people are sharing, because there is too much of it, and the cost of filtering it out for myself doesn't pay for itself. I think most of them adopt such know-how not from the Web, but by imitating the methods practiced by &quot;good engineers&quot; close to them.

*1343047785*11111 years old!
Today was my 31st birthday + 1st wedding anniversary.

I said, &quot;I'm 31 years old... I'm worried that I'm gradually becoming a boring adult.
Wife: &quot;Hmm, don't worry, he's just a kid.&quot;
I said, &quot;Gahhhh!&quot;

Then: I forgot to bring the lunch box I had made to the office ‚Üí I had no choice but to go eat sudadon for lunch ‚Üí I ate too late and was not hungry at night ‚Üí I canceled my plan to go out for French food ‚Üí I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

Next year I will finally turn 20 in hexadecimal, and I hope to be a bit more mature by late adulthood. Thank you for your continued support.
&lt;/body>
