<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/claude/icon" alt="claude.icon" height="19.5"/>This dialogue is a profound discussion of the structural challenges and future vision of contemporary society by two intellectuals who stand at the convergence point of social thought and philosophy of science. The main points of contention are as follows</p>
<ol>
<li>fragmentation and reintegration of academia:
<ul>
<li>In response to the trend toward fragmentation in the social sciences since the 19th century, this article discusses the need to rethink society as a whole. It suggests the limitations of reductionist approaches and explores the possibility of applying complex systems theory and emergent concepts to social understanding.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>deconstruction of anthropocentrism:
<ul>
<li>It critically examines the anthropocentrism assumed by conventional political and economic systems and presents a vision of a new social system that encompasses the entire ecosystem. This includes innovative ideas that extend the concepts of ownership and voting rights to non-human life forms.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>transformation of the site of intellectual production:
<ul>
<li>The limitations of the university system and the possibilities for intellectual production beyond it are discussed. Here, we see a search for interdisciplinary and practical venues for the creation of knowledge.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the conflict between thought and practice:
<ul>
<li>We are deeply concerned with the relationship between theory and practice in social change. In particular, we offer a critique of the ‚Äúsupremacy of practice‚Äù in contemporary society and a reassessment of the role of pure thinkers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>contemporary criticism from a historical perspective:
<ul>
<li>It relativizes contemporary professionalism with reference to the multifaceted work of 18th- and 19th-century thinkers and mid-20th-century scientists.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>vision of the future society:
<ul>
<li>It explores the possibilities of new social systems that go beyond existing political and economic concepts and provides insight into the co-evolution of technological innovation and social institutions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This dialogue can be appreciated as an intellectual endeavor that combines academic rigor and bold thought experimentation, and is oriented toward a fundamental restructuring of contemporary society. While emphasizing the importance of thought from a long-term perspective, the dialogue also refers to the difficulties of accepting innovative thought in the same period, and is highly suggestive from the perspective of the history of ideas.</p>

I met Mr. Narita in person when he was a freshman in college. Through a connection with my advisor, Takashi Ikegami, I wrote a book titled ‚ÄúNAM Generation‚Äù published in 2001, in which I wrote an essay on PICSY, which Mr. Narita helped me with.</p>

When I asked him if there was anyone good as a research assistant, Narita-san was the first person who came to my mind. It is no exaggeration to say that he has been driving my research ever since.</p>

If an organization like a publishing house, which is not a centennial organization, is going to have it, it will be run on a single-year budget, so it will only last a few years if the decision-making changes. It is difficult to create a place that will keep it for a decade.</p>

I was surprised that Mr. Narita wrote a book that asks such a question to society. My impression of Mr. Narita when I was a university student was that he was a bit out of touch with the world, so I thought this book was getting closer to the world of the floating world.</p>
