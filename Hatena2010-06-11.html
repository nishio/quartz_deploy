*1276214233* Notes on &quot;Systematization of the Unknown&quot; discussion
Make a list: what is known now is not everything&quot;, &quot;There is an order: there is no single correct order&quot;, &quot;There are exceptions: eliminating exceptions by introducing new elements&quot;, &quot;There are values: abstraction. Zero → real constant → function, probability distribution, complex numbers, etc.&quot;, &quot;Regularity is not known: find regularity by observing simple examples&quot;, &quot;There are many kinds: is it a combination of lesser kinds of components?&quot;, &quot;A or B: is it not a combination?

I brainstormed alone yesterday and came up with this much.

*1276226587* I got an email from Google saying &quot;App Engine applications you own affected by unapplied writes&quot;.
I got an email from Google saying &quot;Unapplied Writes on your app due to data center problems.

In brief summary
- The data center lost power.
- The &quot;data written in the previous few minutes&quot; had not yet been synced to the secondary database.
- The service was resumed before it was fully synced.
- It is not possible to mechanically merge &quot;that data&quot; because the service has resumed based on the pre-sync data.
- I put it in the DataStore under the name __unapplied_write__foobar, so each of you can merge it as you like.
This seems to be the case.

In my case, the three ballots and the resulting updates to the tally information were UNAPPLIED.

*1276264560*Leverage memo for Drucker's Post-Capitalism Chapter 1: From Capitalist Society to Knowledge Society.
>>
What brought about the Industrial Revolution: The Industrial Revolution was brought about by the application of knowledge. Knowledge used to be about existence. Knowledge became an action. It became a resource.
As a first step, knowledge was applied to tools, processes, and products for 100 years after the mid-18th century. That was the Industrial Revolution. At the same time, it brought about what Marx called alienation, class, struggle, and communism.
In a second phase, beginning around 1880 and culminating at the end of World War II, knowledge was applied to work. The result was the Productivity Revolution. The Productivity Revolution defeated class, struggle, and communism.
In the third phase, knowledge became applied to knowledge. That was the management revolution. Knowledge became the largest factor of production, replacing land, labor, and capital. p.24-25
&lt;&lt;

>>
For a long time, since the time of Plato, knowledge had only two forms. Socrates believed that the purpose of knowledge is self-knowledge, that is, one's own spiritual growth. Protagoras, on the other hand, believed that the purpose of knowledge is to know how to say what one knows. Knowledge meant logic, grammar, rhetoric, and general education. The same was true in the East. Confucianism was about knowing what to say and how to say it, the way of life. In Taoism and Zen Buddhism, knowledge was self-awareness and the path to wisdom.

Despite these two schools of thought, knowledge was not about action. It was not utility. What gave utility was not knowledge, but techne (skill) as in Greek. p. 34
&lt;&lt;

Since 1700, technology has been invented in just 50 years.

>>
Today it is clear that Marx's prediction was wrong p. 41
What defeated Marx? The answer was the Productivity Revolution: in 1881, Taylor applied his knowledge to the study, analysis, and assembly of manual labor jobs.
&lt;&lt;
&lt;a href='http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%95%E3%83%AC%E3%83%87%E3%83%AA %E3%83%83%E3%82%AF%E3%83%BB%E3%83%86%E3%82%A4%E3%83%A9%E3 %83%BC'>Frederick Taylor - Wikipedia&lt;/a>

>>
Education and training have exploded productivity.
&lt;&lt;

>>
A few years after Taylor applied his knowledge to his work, the productivity of physical workers began to grow by 3.5%~4% per year. This meant a doubling in 18 years. Since Taylor to date productivity has increased 50-fold. p.51
&lt;&lt;

>>
Today, knowledge is the only meaningful resource. Knowledge in such a new sense is knowledge as utility. P.57
&lt;&lt;

>>
Management was defined as &quot;being responsible for the work of one's subordinates.&quot; This is the definition that many will still draw in their minds. The correct definition is &quot;one who is responsible for the application of knowledge and its work.
&lt;&lt;

>>
What is now considered knowledge must be proven by action to be knowledge. What we consider knowledge today is information for action, information focused on results.
&lt;&lt;

*1276276145*Civilization for iPad now!
I noticed that an iPad version was available, so I quickly bought it and have been playing it, and I am shocked at how different it is from Civ4 in many ways.

It's just like Civ4, where the greats have all sorts of effects, but it's still good enough for scientists to finish their research or 50% booth science. Karl Marx was born in Kyoto and asked, &quot;Would you rather boost culture 50% or turn the Chinese city of Xi'an into our civilization?&quot; Oh my! It's a bloodless city!

If the population is growing without building churches and other culture building facilities, the borders will shrink because the culture per population will no longer meet the standards and people will say &quot;it's UNCIVILIZED&quot;!

War was declared on something Islamic. Saracens? Oh, it's Arab. Well, I don't know if we can upgrade our soldiers or what, but I think it's an enemy we don't need to fear too much since it's UNCIVILIZED, but at any rate, I'm a SimCity player without waging war, so I don't have a lot of troops.

The Arabs have changed their political form from dictatorship to fundamentalism. Instead of stopping the development of science, they gave land units +1 attack power. Oh dear. What a messed up country.

The Arabs offered me peace when Fez fell before my troops reached the Arab capital. I refused, but since I am a democrat, the parliament voted for peace. Damn.

Hmmm. Next, our neighbor China declared war on us.
&lt;/body>
