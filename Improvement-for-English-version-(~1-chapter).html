<pre><code>- Chapter 1, &quot;How to Learn Something New,&quot; considers how to learn something for which there is no right answer. It details how to learn through a cycle of learning so that you can apply what you learn to situations rather than memorizing it.
+ Chapter 1 is &quot;How to Learn Something New.&quot; Just learning the answers does not mean that you will be able to apply them to your situation. To acquire the ability to apply, you need to go through a three-phase cycle: information gathering, abstraction, and practice. This chapter will explore each phase in detail.

That‚Äôs not the important part (the problem is the same if you buy the e-book).

Initially, the emphasis was on writing without changing a single word, but today in the context of programming education, it simply refers to reading a short piece of code, entering it into a computer, and then running it to see how it behaves.)

<li>In other words, you need a goal that is not too far from you. Other people‚Äôs goals are irrelevant. You need to decide what goals are appropriate for you.</li>

<p>Goal=Goal, but maybe we should look at the entire perimeter and not unnecessarily sway the wording.
The title in Japanese is ‚ÄúGoal is achievable‚Äù, but in English it is ‚ÄúGoal is achievable‚Äù.
If you are going to use them differently, you need to specify the use, but I don‚Äôt see any particular need to use them differently.</p>

+In the days of paper books, it was very important to get the big picture. Search costs were high and it was necessary to narrow down where the information you were looking for was located.</p>

<li>The concretization of objectives is the same as in the previous section of this chapter.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Specificity of purpose is the same as ‚ÄúPrerequisites for learning from what you want to know > Goals are clearly defined‚Äù described in the previous section of this chapter.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>So instead of the imprecise and distant goal of ‚Äúunderstanding the paper in detail,‚Äù you created a clear goal with time segments and tried to get the general structure in your head.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Instead of the unclear and distant goal of ‚Äúunderstanding the paper in detail,‚Äù you have created a close and clear goal by dividing your time and focusing only on the broad structure.</li>

<li>On the other hand, when you are trying to discuss something, you must know where to find the article to which you need to refer and be able to read there.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>On the other hand, when you are trying to discuss something, you need to refer to an article. So you have to know where the article is located.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The difference is that it is drawn in a tree-like form so that the hierarchy above and below can be quickly found, and it is on one large sheet of paper so that the entire page can be viewed without turning the page.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The difference is the form of the information. Information is drawn in a tree-like format so that you can quickly find the hierarchy above and below. It will also be on one large sheet of paper so that the entire page can be viewed without turning the page.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>During class, when referring to a particular article, we look at this map many times to see ‚Äúwhere‚Äù the article is located. For example, Article 570 ‚ÄúSeller‚Äôs Liability for Defects‚Äù is in Part 3, ‚ÄúClaims,‚Äù in Chapter 2, ‚ÄúContracts,‚Äù in Section 3, ‚ÄúPurchase and Sale,‚Äù and so on. Every time you mention an article, it is in Part 3, Claims, Chapter 2, Contracts, Section 3, Purchase and Sale, Article 570: ‚Ä¶ and you will see the information in the higher levels over and over again, so it will naturally enter your mind. I found tracing the map from the root each time to be a useful method in systematically storing a vast amount of information in my brain.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>During class, when referring to a particular article, look at this map to see where that article is located and vocalize it in order, starting at the top level. For example, Article 570 ‚ÄúSeller‚Äôs Liability for Defects‚Äù is located in Part 3, ‚ÄúClaims,‚Äù in Chapter 2, ‚ÄúContracts,‚Äù in Section 3, ‚ÄúPurchase and Sale. So, whenever the article is mentioned, it occurs as ‚ÄúPart 3, Claims, Chapter 2, Contract, Section 3, Purchase and Sale, Article 570, Seller‚Äôs Liability for Defects‚Äù.</li>
<li>This activity causes the information in the upper levels of the hierarchy to be seen many times. The closer the information is to the root, the more frequently it appears. Therefore, we memorize it naturally. Tracing the map back to the root each time is a useful way to systematically store vast amounts of information in the brain.</li>
</ul>
<p>I made it more specific.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>+If you can‚Äôt gather information in broad strokes, you have to do it from one end of the spectrum to the other.
+If you read the table of contents in an attempt to get a general idea of the big picture, you may not understand anything. This phenomenon often occurs when learning something new. This is caused by not having enough material to build an understanding.
+Often, the words in the table of contents are already an abstraction. If you don‚Äôt have the knowledge to support that abstraction, you won‚Äôt be able to read the table of contents and understand it; if you don‚Äôt have the knowledge to support that abstraction, you won‚Äôt be able to understand it.
+We often think about what is the most efficient way to learn. However, it is a waste of time to try to figure that out when we do not even have the materials to determine what would be efficient to learn from. We need to get the materials first.</p>

<li>You may look at this estimate and be demotivated, thinking you have to spend 25 hours. But you are wrong; you do not have to spend 25 hours.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Even in the worst case scenario where you are unable to learn effectively, you can estimate that if you continue to copy sutras for 25 hours, you will have copied a textbook, which will make it easier to stay motivated than if you vaguely think, ‚ÄúI have no idea what I am reading, but I must do my best to learn. The ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm reading, but I have to work hard to learn it.

<p>Use models to save thought.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Models are simplified representations to explain how the real world works. Since the phenomena occurring in the real world are complex, we simplify them by trimming away the unimportant parts so that even limited human cognitive abilities can handle them. For example, in high school physics, air resistance and friction are assumed to be non-existent. The air resistance and friction that exist in the real world are ignored to simplify the problem so that high school students can handle it.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Since the model is an excerpt of reality, it does not perfectly match reality. This is what is referred to as ‚Äúall models are wrong‚Äù Note 31.</p>

<li>
<p>Models allow low-cost experimentation.</p>

<p>The value of a model is not how well it matches reality. It is how much less expensive it is to manipulate the model compared to directly manipulating realityNote 32.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>In particular, a model expressed in the form of a mathematical formula is called a ‚Äúmathematical model. When a model is created in the form of a mathematical equation or program, it is easier to conduct experiments. This is because there is no need for physical experimental equipment.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>When a programmer has a problem with a program, he or she can predict the problem and guess correctly before looking at the actual source code. How is this possible? He has a model of the program in his brain, and he can experiment in his brain to see what phenomena occur when he breaks various parts of that model. He then picks out the phenomena that occur as a result of the breakage that are similar to the actual observed facts.</p>

<li>In ‚ÄúMake and Verify‚Äù (* page), we talked about making something based on our understanding and verifying the correctness of our understanding by seeing if it works as expected.

<p>+In ‚ÄúMake and Verify‚Äù (* page), we talked about verifying your understanding by creating a program. Understanding corresponds to Axiom A. You create a concrete program based on your understanding. This corresponds to the concrete claim S. You then observe whether this program behaves as you expect. The concrete behavior of the program corresponds directly to your experience E, and you verify it by checking it against it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Einstein thought that step 4 also belonged to intuition, because the relationship between the concepts that appear in S and direct experience is not logical, for example, there is no basis for mapping the word dog to what we directly experience when we see a dog. I guess this is related to the ‚Äúall models are wrong‚Äù story, that since models are different from direct experience, we cannot logically say whether a newly observed direct experience corresponds to a particular model or not.</li>

<li>Einstein considered step 4 to also belong to intuition, because the relationship between the concepts that appear in S and our direct experience is not logical. For example, the mapping between the word dog and what we directly experience when we see a dog has no logical basis. This idea is a related story to ‚Äúall models are wrong. Since models are different from the real world phenomena themselves, the interpretation of a newly observed phenomenon by a particular model is not a logical decision, but a subjective human choice.</li>
