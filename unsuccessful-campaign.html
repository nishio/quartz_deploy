<p>Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications: Guidelines for the Revised Public Offices Election Law (Lifting the ban on Internet election campaigning) (Version 1: April 26, 2013)
p.28</p>
<blockquote>
<p>About the campaign to drop out of the election
According to judicial precedents and actual cases, election campaigning under the Public Office Election Law refers to the campaigning of a specific candidate (not necessarily limited to one candidate) in a specific election.
The act is considered to be necessary and advantageous to obtain or cause to be obtained votes for the purpose of election of a person (who is not a candidate for election).
Thus, even an act aimed at the elimination of one candidate is an election campaign if it is aimed at the election of another candidate.
However, it is understood that an act that has no electoral purpose and is merely an attempt to eliminate a particular candidate from office does not constitute election campaigning (Daihyo 5. 9. 23, Penal Code 9.678, etc.).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>2015</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Minors are “allowed” to campaign for the election.
To be sure, we checked with the Election Division of the Local Government Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, and they clearly stated, “Unless an unsuccessful campaign is recognized as an election campaign that includes the intent to elect a specific candidate, it is not bound by the prior campaign. Furthermore, he said that although the Public Election Law prohibits minors who do not have the right to vote from campaigning, there is no law or regulation that regulates minors in terms of campaigning for unsuccessful candidates, and therefore, “there will be no problem” if minors engage in campaigning for unsuccessful candidates.</p>

<p>Ryosuke Nishida, associate professor of sociology at Tokyo University of Technology and an expert on the relationship between politics and the media, said, “With the lifting of the ban on online elections, it has become easier for many people to join together beyond their local communities.

<p>Associate Professor Nishida sees the unsuccessful election campaign as “an expressive activity with a political nature. He pointed out that “the Internet penetration rate <a href="./higher-than-in-Japan" class="internal alias" data-slug="higher-than-in-Japan">higher than in Japan</a> and distrust of the mass media <a href="./were" class="internal" data-slug="were">were</a> behind the fact that the South Korean voter suppression campaign had a certain effect. In Japan, the voting rate among people in their 30s and 40s or younger who use the Internet is low.

For democracy, <a href="./a-diversity-of" class="internal alias" data-slug="a-diversity-of">a diversity of</a> expressive activities is preferable. If the purpose is to spread a new discourse originating from the Internet, it makes sense as an <a href="./expression-strategy" class="internal alias" data-slug="expression-strategy">expression strategy</a>,” he said.</p>
