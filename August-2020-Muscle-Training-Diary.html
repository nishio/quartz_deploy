<li>Why it was reopened
<ul>
<li>The lighter ones, about 5 times, I’ve been doing when I thought of them for the past week or so, too light to keep track of.</li>
<li>My wife was playing a game called AFK Arena, so I added it myself. This is a game where you start a battle and it becomes an auto-battle and you don’t have to control anything in particular.</li>
<li>I did some push ups while I was waiting and they were about 5-10.</li>
<li>I repeated the cycle of pushing up 5 times, then pressing the “next battle” button, and easily reached 120 times.
<ul>
<li>It’s like you’re bored because your brain isn’t stimulated enough.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Yesterday I went out with my wife for the first time in a while, so that may have been a trigger.
Records of periods of slacking off.</li>

<li>Looking at the weight alone, the graph can be interpreted as “nothing has been done, but it is dropping steadily”.</li>
<li>But when I look at body fat, it’s stopped dropping.</li>
<li>Muscle mass is also usually the flip side of body fat.</li>
<li>Body fat percentage is increasing at a time when the interval between weigh-ins is growing.</li>

<p>About AFK Arena Driven Muscle Training</p>
<ul>
<li>This game is designed to “accumulate resources while left unattended, which can be used to strengthen the character.
<ul>
<li>In other words, when you wake up in the morning, your character can be stronger and you can go where you couldn’t go before.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>→ triggers exercise in the morning.
<ul>
<li>Wake up in the morning, strengthen your character, progress through the map while training your muscles, drink protein, and so on.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Well, it’s only the first day, so I may not be able to talk about it enough to train my muscles like that anytime soon.</li>
<li>Also, <a href="./jackknife-squat" class="internal alias" data-slug="jackknife-squat">jackknife squat</a> and <a href="./incline-push-up" class="internal alias" data-slug="incline-push-up">incline push-up</a> can be done while looking at the phone, but the others not so much.</li>

<li>Sometimes my wife does different kinds of things that she finds on YouTube or whatever.
<ul>
<li>Novel stimuli are important because you get bored when you get used to them.</li>
<li>That’s the kind of thing you should keep track of.</li>
<li>It’s a new trigger acquisition.
<ul>
<li>Like doing heel lift exercises to get the calf pump going when the low pressure is uncomfortable.</li>

<li>myalgia
<ul>
<li>It is more appropriate to “feel the presence of the muscle” rather than pain</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I’m exercising by avoiding areas I’ve used before.
<ul>
<li>But even when I’m doing short bridges, there’s still a presence on the inside of my squatting muscle sore thighs.

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Prisoner Training’s original beginner program only does muscle training twice a week.
<ul>
<li>They’re taking longer to recover.</li>
<li>In contrast, I’ve been doing muscle training every day for the past few days, so I’m on a fast pace.</li>
<li>I think we’ll eventually have to intersperse stretching, etc. instead of muscle training.
<ul>
<li>I just tried to do the flat knee raises I did last night to test it out, and I felt like I was going to hurt my back.</li>
<li>I can do the incline push ups I did the day before yesterday, but I don’t think I can do the number of repetitions because I don’t feel like I’ve recovered.</li>
<li>So, we’ll be in a “no recovering muscles” situation rather soon.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Prisoner Training opposes passive stretching, but does not deny its effectiveness in stimulating blood circulation and removing waste products after training (<a href="./Prisoner-Training-Super-ministry-grip--and--joints" class="internal alias" data-slug="Prisoner-Training-Super-ministry-grip--and--joints">Prisoner Training Super ministry grip &amp; joints</a> p.185)

<li>My wife says, “<a href="./katana-and-wakizashi" class="internal alias" data-slug="katana-and-wakizashi">katana and wakizashi</a> is why.”</li>
<li>The load is escaping to the lower back instead of the abdominal muscles.</li>

<li>120 Incline Push-Ups
<ul>
<li>I started thinking I was fine because I recovered, but I guess I didn’t recover because it got hard after about 80 sessions.</li>
<li>Be careful, because when it gets hard, you will want to move with vigor.</li>

- Maybe we can take the next step?</p>
<ul>
<li>Supported squat 10
<ul>
<li>Skidding.</li>
<li>It’s funny how the jackknife squat supports you mainly by pulling you sideways.</li>
<li>And because they’re compensating for that, they’re not getting the full range of motion in the hip joints.</li>
<li>Therefore, he is not able to support the force of falling backward with his legs when he squats in a supported squat</li>
<li>When I say keep your back level with the ground, I mean fold your hip joints first.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>8/14</p>
<ul>
<li>120 Incline Push-Ups</li>
<li>I think my back hurts from flat knee raises because I don’t have the basics, so I’m going back to knee tucks.
<ul>
<li>I avoided Neatac because it was difficult to maintain the starting position and my back would hurt quickly.</li>
<li>I decided that flat knee raises hid the instability in the lower back area by lying on the floor, but it wasn’t gone, so when I did a lot of them, I would have serious back pain.</li>
<li>Do as many as possible just to maintain the starting position of the Neatac.</li>
