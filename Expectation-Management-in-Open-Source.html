- A discussion of contributions to the open source community and the return of revenue was held around the case of a developer who had successfully converted from an open source project to a proprietary product and earned an income.
- Mr. Piro, while self-evaluating his non-monetary contributions to the community, raised the question of the lack of return of profits to open source projects.
- Touching on the need for [[expectation management]] in open source, he noted the importance of recognizing [[the risk of having expectations]] for success and reputation.

<li>Summary <img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/gpt/icon" alt="gpt.icon" height="19.5"/>
This series of tweets includes a discussion surrounding an article about a person who experienced the transition from an open source project to a proprietary product. The article focuses on a developer who struggled with open source and then found success and income with a proprietary product. Piro (the tweeter) discusses his contributions to the open source community and the return of revenue, as well as his own actions and ideas.</li>
</ul>
<p>While Piro feels that monetary returns to open source projects are lacking, he noted that he contributes to the community in non-monetary ways, such as by reporting bugs and publishing his code. He also mentioned the possibility of monetizing open source products for businesses, noting that the lack of licensing fees attracts customers in part because of the low cost.</p>
<p>He also discusses the possibility of making large profits by targeting “only paying customers” through proprietaryization, pointing out that this strategy could apply not only to large companies and independent vendors offering open source-dependent products and services, but also to individual developers. However, he questions whether these profits are being returned to open source projects, and explains why he himself does not accept donations.</p>
<p>Finally, Piro mentioned the importance of expectation management in open source projects, noting that one must be prepared that expectations such as success and honor are “gamble,” with no guarantees. This reflects the reality that working with open source does not always lead to direct rewards or recognition.</p>

I regret going open source.” I was just talking to a student yesterday about the article about the person who said, “We aim to be a place where people can make a living while publishing the results of their work”. I wondered if he was funneling the money he makes into those projects. I wondered if he is funneling his profits to those projects.
