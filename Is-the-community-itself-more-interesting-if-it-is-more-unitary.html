Would the community itself be rather more interesting if it were more unitary?</p>

It is more interesting if <a href="./an-individual-belongs-to-multiple-communities-and-maintains-diversity-among-them" class="internal alias" data-slug="an-individual-belongs-to-multiple-communities-and-maintains-diversity-among-them">an individual belongs to multiple communities and maintains diversity among them</a>.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>T: I imagine that people have a lot of knowledge, and they can just say, “You know what?</p>
<ul>
<li>Similar in some aspects.</li>
<li>「<a href="./アオいいよね" class="internal alias" data-slug="アオいいよね">アオいいよね</a>」で全部伝わるような集団かな<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/cFQ2f7LRuLYP/icon" alt="/villagepump/cFQ2f7LRuLYP.icon" height="19.5"/></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>N: If the definition is that all participants are similar, then of course I who am participating in them are similar, so if I belong to community A and B, then A and B are also similar</p>

<li>
<p>“<a href="./Some-knowledge-is" class="internal alias" data-slug="Some-knowledge-is">Some knowledge is</a> shared in high concentration throughout.” or</p>
<ul>
<li>T: yes, yes, yes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>N: In the end, that’s “<a href="./I-enjoy" class="internal alias" data-slug="I-enjoy">I enjoy</a> a community where knowledge is shared in high concentration.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>T: Yes.</p>
<ul>
<li>There’s a high concentration of knowledge shared in certain areas, but not so much in others.</li>
<li>Still, we can say “that community is unitary.”</li>
<li>I mean, the premise is that a community is not interesting unless there is a strong unity in some attribute.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>N: Hypothesis: Because of Mr. Tachikawa’s idea that “<a href="./all-participants-should-be-able-to-enjoy" class="internal alias" data-slug="all-participants-should-be-able-to-enjoy">all participants should be able to enjoy</a>,” <a href="./interpretation-tailored-to-those-without-knowledge" class="internal alias" data-slug="interpretation-tailored-to-those-without-knowledge">interpretation tailored to those without knowledge</a> and <a href="./topic-control" class="internal alias" data-slug="topic-control">topic control</a> will spoil the fun in the absence of <a href="./high-concentration-of-knowledge-sharing" class="internal alias" data-slug="high-concentration-of-knowledge-sharing">high concentration of knowledge sharing</a>.</p>

<li>
<p>T Oh, that’s right.</p>

<li>Isn’t that usually the case?</li>

<p>N: You implicitly assume voice <a href="./synchronous-communication" class="internal alias" data-slug="synchronous-communication">synchronous communication</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>T: Oh, you do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>N: There is a community of culture that says, “<a href="./Don't-demand-that" class="internal alias" data-slug="Don't-demand-that">Don’t demand that</a> the reader skim what they are not interested in, don’t demand that the speaker output so much to the reader’s expectations.”</p>

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>T: Is that something that if the speaker offers a topic that no one is interested in, everyone will skip over it?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>N: Yes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>T: Then the speaker would automatically leave the community</p>

<li>No, on the contrary, some social networking sites have a “<a href="./mute" class="internal" data-slug="mute">mute</a> to” mechanism.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<p>T: Ah, okay, it’s possible that you’re <a href="./throwing-different-things-into-the-&quot;community&quot;" class="internal alias" data-slug="throwing-different-things-into-the-&quot;community&quot;">throwing different things into the “community”</a> box!</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="./word" class="internal" data-slug="word">word</a> “community” is too big.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>N: Tachikawa’s <a href="./level-of-expectation-for-the-community" class="internal alias" data-slug="level-of-expectation-for-the-community">level of expectation for the community</a> is high</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m expensive, so I feel I have to satisfy the other participants.</li>
<li>It can be expressed the other way around.</li>
<li>My level of expectation for the community is low.</li>
<li>So <a href="./I'm-not-willing-to-devote-my-effort-to-the-care-of-others" class="internal alias" data-slug="I'm-not-willing-to-devote-my-effort-to-the-care-of-others">I’m not willing to devote my effort to the care of others</a> and I’m not willing to let <a href="./the-community-disappear" class="internal alias" data-slug="the-community-disappear">the community disappear</a> because of it.</li>
<li>I should learn a little more from Mr. Tachikawa.</li>
<li>On the other hand, I think “not every community is worth the effort” is also True.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>T: I agree with this and it’s more like <a href="./ownership" class="internal" data-slug="ownership">ownership</a> than expectations for the community</p>
<ul>
<li>[I guess I feel that if I work hard, the community will improve, and if I don’t work hard, it won’t improve.</li>
<li>My image of a good community is <a href="./a-community-with-a-high-level-of-ownership-by-the-participants" class="internal alias" data-slug="a-community-with-a-high-level-of-ownership-by-the-participants">a community with a high level of ownership by the participants</a>.</li>
<li>Or is it a community where there are multiple members with high ownership.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>N: Mr. Tachikawa sees the community as “<a href="./an-object" class="internal alias" data-slug="an-object">an object</a> that you can improve,” while the majority of people see it as “something that is there <a href="./naturally" class="internal" data-slug="naturally">naturally</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s like ownership of a software product.</li>
<li>[I feel like I’m holding the steering wheel.</li>
<li>There’s likely to be a political stance like this as well.<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/基素/icon" alt="/villagepump/基素.icon" height="19.5"/></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>T: I see!</p>
<ul>
<li>In my opinion, even a community that seems to have come about naturally must have been created by at least one individual who thought, “I wish this was a community!</li>
<li>If no one has that expectation, then the community won’t be able to? I think so.</li>
<li>There is someone’s will in the community! A sense of</li>
<li>I think it’s usually a factual error to see a community as something that’s “naturally there.” w</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>N: I think that at least <a href="./geographical-communities" class="internal alias" data-slug="geographical-communities">geographical communities</a> occur naturally, but instead they are connected only because they are “in the same place,” so if they leave, they are cut off. If there is a will to create a “community that continues to be connected even after you leave,” then the community that Mr. Tachikawa is referring to is created for that purpose.</p>
<ul>
<li>There’s also a naturally occurring community of people who attended the same college at the same time, and if they’re not incorporated into the “surviving <a href="./alumni" class="internal" data-slug="alumni">alumni</a> community,” they’ll dissipate into the clouds with graduation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>T: My thinking is different. For example, in a community of college classmates, if someone doesn’t have a sense of “we’re classmates, so we want to get along with each other,” it won’t happen.</p>
<ul>
<li>You don’t need as strong an ownership as you have at the wheel, but you do need to have a <a href="./vague-expectation" class="internal alias" data-slug="vague-expectation">vague expectation</a> that you want to get along with each other.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>N: It reflects the high expectations of Mr. Tachikawa, who only recognizes as a community a community of people who share <a href="./the-intention-to-&quot;get-along&quot;" class="internal alias" data-slug="the-intention-to-&quot;get-along&quot;">the intention to “get along”</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Where you draw the line in the definition is not essential, so that’s fine.</li>
<li>I don’t think all of us start out with the intention of “getting along.”</li>
<li><a href="./Intentions-when-people-join-a-&quot;group-of-people&quot;" class="internal alias" data-slug="Intentions-when-people-join-a-&quot;group-of-people&quot;">Intentions when people join a “group of people”</a>, I think there’s a lot more to it than that.</li>
<li><a href="./I-want-you-to-pay-attention-to-me" class="internal alias" data-slug="I-want-you-to-pay-attention-to-me">I want you to pay attention to me</a>, <a href="./help-me-achieve-what-I-want-to-achieve" class="internal alias" data-slug="help-me-achieve-what-I-want-to-achieve">help me achieve what I want to achieve</a>, <a href="./get-along-with-me" class="internal alias" data-slug="get-along-with-me">get along with me</a>, is that about it?</li>
<li>And there’s also the desire to “<a href="./be" class="internal" data-slug="be">be</a> left alone,” which doesn’t go into a group of people.
<ul>
<li>Postscript:.<a href="./McClelland's-theory-of-desire" class="internal alias" data-slug="McClelland's-theory-of-desire">McClelland’s theory of desire</a> <img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon" alt="/villagepump/nishio.icon" height="19.5"/></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There’s a type of participation where you don’t actively go in, but if you <a href="./being-swept-up-in" class="internal alias" data-slug="being-swept-up-in">being swept up in</a>, you try to get involved a little bit, and if you’re not uncomfortable, you’ll settle in.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>T: I’m not sure about the classification, but it’s certainly true that you have a purpose other than just wanting to get along.</p>
