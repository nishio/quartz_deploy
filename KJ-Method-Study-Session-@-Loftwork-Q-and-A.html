<p>Question 1</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>I would like to know if there is a way to stretch afterwards because the feeling of immersion is amazing and the brain load is incredible.</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>I want to know too. I tend to <a href="./overconcentration" class="internal" data-slug="overconcentration">overconcentration</a>.
<ul>
<li>The solution does not seem to be in the KJ method.</li>
<li>Right now <a href="./Apple-Watch" class="internal alias" data-slug="Apple-Watch">Apple Watch</a> is monitoring me and saying, ‚ÄúGet up,‚Äù but it would be nice to see more development of that type of technology.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Supplemental Slack
<ul>
<li>I‚Äôm not good at stretching my brain, but I do walk when I feel like switching after sitting at a desk for a long time and using my brain.</li>
<li>I don‚Äôt consciously think about the subject I was thinking about earlier, but sometimes something related comes to mind.</li>
<li>However, I don‚Äôt expect or try to come up with something, I prefer to relax!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 2: Sorting out the facts and feelings</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>Themes about me
<ul>
<li>The following are mixed on the sticky note
<ul>
<li>Solid facts about yourself</li>
<li>My own considerations and feelings about it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There are also sticky notes with sentences, and the granularity is uneven.</li>
<li>I noticed this after I wrote it, at the stage of spreading it out.</li>
<li>Was this the right thing to do?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>good
<ul>
<li>This time, the goal is to gain awareness
<ul>
<li>The objective is not to collect and analyze objective data to create a report.</li>
<li>(Supplement)If the subject is about yourself, ‚Äúyou‚Äù are the most important interviewee.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>therefore
- I want to do this
- I feel this way.
- I thought to myself, in response to a fact
<ul>
<li>These are all ‚Äúdata.
<ul>
<li>see: ‚ÄúWhat is data?‚Äù in the lecture material.
<ul>
<li>Data‚Äù is what we observe and record about a wide variety of things.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A ‚Äústicky note in writing‚Äù is a good thing.
<ul>
<li>Not abstract word fragments.</li>
<li>The ‚Äúraw voice‚Äù of one‚Äôs feelings and thoughts overflowing.</li>
<li>It is not well-formed because it has just started to overflow, but this is rather more important than abstract concepts
<ul>
<li>Related:.

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can write down anything that comes to your mind as it comes to you.
<ul>
<li>Keep it in your mind and it will disappear.</li>
<li>Write it down, record it, and make it ‚Äúdata‚Äù.</li>
<li>When you put it out of your mind and into data, it becomes an indelible object of observation.</li>
<li>You will be able to think carefully while observing that data.</li>
<li>That way you can think better.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 3: What is the</p>
<ul>
<li>
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>
  - Yesterday, I took each piece of information sensitively and came up with ideas.
  - Today I learned that you have to expand from the center theme sticky note, so I took it apart and tried to expand from the center.
  - Something feels different, what is this?
</li>
<li>
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>
  - Same sticky note.
      - Yesterday, handle it the way you are used to,
      - Handle it in a new way today,
  - So you felt there was a difference between the two?
  - I'll have to compare the two to see what the difference is... and I'll answer here without looking...
  - What is the difference?
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>I need to organize‚Äù is strong today.
<ul>
<li>Scrutinize information one by one
<ul>
<li>I don‚Äôt want it</li>
<li>useless</li>
<li>what does this mean?</li>
<li>I don‚Äôt understand this structure.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sense of being in tune with the information side, rather than doing it sensibly.</li>
<li>it is difficult to move</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>
  - > Sense of being in tune with the information side
  - It sounds like a good thing that you are &quot;listening to the data&quot; and &quot;letting the data do the talking&quot;.
  - But as for the person in question, it appears that some kind of negative emotion is occurring.
  - I'm wondering what exactly was going on.
  - Just to confirm, was there a strong feeling of &quot;I need to organize&quot; today?
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>It was more about organizing than conceptualizing.</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Where did this feeling of ‚ÄúI need to organize‚Äù come from?</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>Pulled by ‚Äúspread from the center.‚Äù</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Pulled. What does ‚Äúpulled‚Äù mean?</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>I‚Äôm not sure this is what you meant by spreading out from the center.</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Were you worried about doing it in a way that you didn‚Äôt know if it was right?</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>Yeah, maybe.</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>if that is the case
<ul>
<li>Yesterday, when I did it the way I‚Äôm used to doing it, I was in a high state of confidence that it was the right thing to do.</li>
<li>I rode a ‚Äúnew way‚Äù and a ‚Äúnew bike‚Äù today.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>Something like that.
<ul>
<li>When you walk, you first put your heel like this‚Ä¶‚Äù</li>
<li>I tried to replace what I was doing unconsciously with technology.</li>
<li>The result was an awkward walk, ‚ÄúHow did I walk in the first place?‚Äù</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Then, everything is positive, including the experience of walking awkwardly this time.
<ul>
<li><img src="https://gyazo.com/94995fa678719b2c6bbcdaf42a784cbd/thumb/1000" alt="image"/></li>
<li>Tip: This is what ‚Äúlooking at it from a different angle‚Äù means, so it‚Äôs a positive thing.</li>
<li>By digging deeper into the differences, we can synthesize the two and arrive at something better!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>I was healed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 4: What is the</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>For purposes such as creating future projections for the year 2030, we have been using a method of repeating large groupings. Can this method be used for this purpose?</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>As for that future prediction task, I have no experience with it at all, so I think you should experiment and decide if you can use it or not!</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>Which method is more suitable for an expert like Dr. Nishio in his thinking?</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>I think it is independence.</li>
<li>This time, in an attempt to manage the short work time, I asked them to make the labels first, which may have confused them.
<ul>
<li>The original thinking fireworks start with no label and a theme written in the middle.
<ul>
<li>In other words data not yet available, situation to be increased from now on</li>
<li>Explore and dig inside yourself first.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The KJ Method assumes [* a large amount of data
<ul>
<li>Too much data to compress.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I think they are like the two wheels of a car.
<ul>
<li>Not necessarily because I‚Äôm a researcher, but because all people have both situations.</li>
<li>For example, at this study session, <img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/> introduced ‚ÄúThinking Fireworks‚Äù
<ul>
<li>This lecture material was shaped by the ‚Äúthinking fireworks‚Äù process as placed in Miro</li>
<li>But in the preliminary stages, I did the ‚ÄúKJ method of beginnings‚Äù method (with additions later).
<ul>
<li>First of all, I felt there was merit in understanding the cost to ‚Äúlet the chaos speak for itself‚Äù.</li>
<li>So, I engraved the table of contents on the labels and made the so-called grouping (with additions later).</li>
<li>Internalize the contents of the book into your own mind.
<ul>
<li>Books‚Äù are ‚Äúinterviewed‚Äù and labeled with observational data,</li>
<li>Organize it and turn it into an organic network of knowledge.</li>
<li>A ‚Äúbeginning KJ method‚Äù approach is useful for this purpose.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Supplemental:.
<ul>
<li>The expression ‚Äúso-called grouping‚Äù was not a good one because there could be a discrepancy in the interpretation of the word ‚Äúgrouping.‚Äù</li>
<li>It was not appropriate to call the KJ method for books a ‚Äúbeginning KJ method‚Äù approach
<ul>
<li>Unlike interviews with many people in fieldwork, books are usually data from a single person, and the tree-like structure is created in advance in the form of a table of contents.</li>
<li>Looking back at what I did:.
<ul>
<li>First, we have a map that just reflects the tree structure of that table of contents.</li>
<li>Then they changed the structure to focus on the links across the branches.
<ul>
<li>This process is similar to the ‚ÄúA large blurry mass is pulled into line and disintegrates.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Continuation of the parable of the two wheels (and axles) of a wheel
<ul>
<li>Massive amounts of information are given from the outside, the ‚ÄúKJ method of beginnings.‚Äù</li>
<li>Thinking Fireworks,‚Äù where you create your own new information from scratch</li>
<li>Jiro Kawakita‚Äôs realization that it is important to ‚Äúdraw information out of oneself‚Äù in this phase of ‚Äúhow to organize a lot of data given from outside.
<ul>
<li>Organizing‚Äù is not a stand-alone concept, but is in fact closely coupled with ‚Äúthinking.</li>
<li>This realization later became a system called the KJ method</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Supplemental:.
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúDrawing information out of yourself‚Äù is also important in the phase of ‚Äúhow to organize a lot of data‚Äù.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>As I was writing this explanation, I asked myself, ‚ÄúNo, you said ‚Äòlet the data speak for itself,‚Äô can I mix my own ideas?‚Äù The question was expected.</li>
<li>So I‚Äôll try to explain from another direction.</li>
<li>If you can draw useful conclusions from the data alone, that‚Äôs the best you can do.</li>
<li>In many cases, however, data alone is not enough to reach a conclusion.
<ul>
<li>It‚Äôs like, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs so much information out there, it‚Äôs a mess, how do I organize it?‚Äù</li>
<li>It‚Äôs not productive to dwell on ‚Äúwhat should I do‚Ä¶‚Äù at this time.
<ul>
<li>Nothing is going ahead.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Worse yet, ‚ÄúThere are some parts that are organized and some messes that are not. Let‚Äôs just use the parts that are organized.‚Äù

<li>Where it was organized quickly, in essence, matched the existing perception.</li>
<li>To use just that and throw out a mess that was not well organized is just reproducing existing perceptions.</li>
<li>There were new ideas to be discovered in that discarded area, but we only use data that supports existing perceptions and stomp out the seeds of ideas.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In these situations, it helps to create new information like ‚ÄúOh, I thought this was unrelated, but if I look at it from this point of view, it will be connected! The creation of new information such as ‚ÄúOh, I thought this was unrelated, but if I look at it from this point of view, it connects!
<ul>
<li>This is something that ‚Äúcame from within‚Äù the individual looking at the data, so from the perspective of someone trying to organize only ‚Äúdata given to them from the outside,‚Äù it‚Äôs like ‚Äúare you sure you want to do that?‚Äù would be.</li>

<p>Question 5: What is the</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>In the process of organizing more and more, the things you want to put together may be scattered in various places
<ul>
<li>Can I force you to put it all together?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>First of all, the realization that ‚Äúwe are far apart, but this is something close‚Äù is a big step forward
<ul>
<li>When I first put it far away, I thought it didn‚Äôt matter, that‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt put it closer.</li>
<li>In the process of sorting through it, I realized, ‚ÄúThis is close.</li>
<li>This link is very important, this is ‚Äúnew awareness‚Äù and ‚Äúbicycles moving forward‚Äù.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Struggling to express that realization on a map.
<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>It‚Äôs so hard.</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Why is that?
<ul>
<li>Because they are trying to do it while maintaining the structure of the past.</li>
<li>Once you think, ‚ÄúThis is too hard,‚Äù you can make a copy of it, save it, and say, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs make a new map with these two nearby.‚Äù</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>I see. So you‚Äôre moving on to the next phase.</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Yes, I‚Äôm moving on to the next phase of my life because of my new awareness.
<ul>
<li>If you try to describe the view from the new perspective while maintaining the view from the old perspective, you get stuck in the middle and wonder ‚Äúwhat to do?‚Äù</li>
<li>In such a case, the important thing is the new one, so just go to the new one.

<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Time constraints are completely for the convenience of the study group, so when doing it alone, it‚Äôs still better to do it without any constraints.
<ul>
<li>Several people said.

<li>If I feel like I should go back, I‚Äôll make sure I can go back.</li>
<li>You can always go back if you want to.</li>

<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>I think the ‚ÄúBeginning KJ method‚Äù is ‚ÄúToo many <span>‚Üí</span> Compression <span>‚Üí</span> Idea‚Äù.

  - I think you've already acquired &quot;my way&quot; and are comfortable with it and enjoy using it in your hands.
      - First of all, that's great.
  - On the other hand, &quot;continuing to use a familiar method&quot; does not yield &quot;new methods.&quot; [[Trade-offs between use and exploration]].
  - Now with hammer in hand.
      - That hammer fits my hand very well and is great!
      - Much better than someone without a hammer.
      - But there's the trap of &quot;[To someone with a hammer, everything looks like a nail.
      - You might even hit something with a hammer that you shouldn't hit with a hammer.
  - Therefore,
      - For example, when you are busy, it is good to use more and more of the methods you are used to using.
      - Whenever I have free time or spare time, I will &quot;explore new methods&quot; with a balance of trying new methods when I feel like it.
          - Doing so would be more profitable in the long run than not exploring.

  - > Thinking and speaking in real time
      - There is shallow and deep in this &quot;thinking&quot;.
      - I personally don't think I'm capable of speaking while deep in thought.
          - I can't do it even while listening to you.
          - I'm hindered only by people soliciting religion at the seat next to me in the caf√©.
      - Shallow thinking is just a hop or so out of what you've already read and thought about and stored in your brain.
          - So, it's simply a &quot;pre-accumulated quantity&quot; game.
          - Ah, yes, it is easy to create a &quot;network of knowledge that connects the major ones&quot; when using KJ legal methods for books
              - (compared to simply reading books head to head).
              - So it will be easier to pull them out in real time.

<p>Question 11: What is the</p>

<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>I felt that there is a sense of ‚Äúadventure‚Äù = ‚Äútaking risks‚Äù that can be seen by daring to go for it.

  - Jiro Kawakita himself sometimes expresses himself in his paintings.
      - ![image](https://gyazo.com/857b3aba09b72b756a5313fa08ef2586/thumb/1000)
              - [[KJ method Let the chaos speak for itself]]  p.253
      - There's nothing at all that says, &quot;It has to be written in letters.&quot;
  - When writing with markers on paper sticky notes at workshops and other events, some people start to come alive by adding a few words, &quot;You may draw a picture!
      - I think we should actively remove the assumption that we have to write in letters.
  - There must be various means that did not exist in Jiro Kawakita's time, such as taking and pasting photos with a smartphone, or drawing with an iPad + ApplePencil.
      - I think you should use whatever is available.
  - Jiro Kawakita himself rather says, &quot;Put the picture in.&quot;
      - Maybe many facilitators skip that step because many people feel psychological resistance when you tell them to &quot;put in a picture&quot; because they don't have the artistic ability.
          - > After the illustration is complete, a &quot;symbol mark&quot; is added to the illustration at the end. Symbols are usually included only for major islands. (p.137)
              - This is the procedure described in the chapter &quot;One Round of Narrow KJ Method&quot;
          - > A symbol mark is as seen in the illustration in Figure 23. (p.137)
              - ![image](https://gyazo.com/fd15dfb827e65ad5dcf65168673a127d/thumb/1000)p.138
              - > In other words, if one wants to understand what an island as a whole is appealing to, it is sufficient to read and understand the nameplate, which is already written on the island, in order to understand it logically and precisely. The nameplate is thus good for precise understanding. But instead, it is often a roundabout way to get around, because it uses human intellect as a passageway. Therefore, it is more helpful to write something symbolic on the island that appeals to the visual, sensory, and intuitive understanding of the content of the island, and to use it in combination with a method that appeals to the instantaneous understanding of the content of the island. (p.137)
          - > Symbols often use words such as verbs, adjectives, and nouns. Sometimes they are phrases, clauses, or short sentences. In any case, however, they must be extremely short. If it is long, the symbolic effect of instantaneous and coherent meaning is diminished.
          - > But sometimes a symbol mark is not a word, but a picture or a symbol. In addition, the shape of the island itself may be depicted in a drawing to give a sense of meaning to the symbolic image. When the islands themselves are pictured, sometimes even the entire contents of the illustration are expressed in a single picture. (p.137)
              - > (p.166)When the essence of a thing is highly boiled down in a Type A diagram, there is a way to convert its essence into a separate pictorial or simplified diagram, without regard to the original diagram.... However, this is not always successful.
              - > In this way, an oral presentation of an extremely simplified yet meaningful picture or illustration can be delivered in a very short period of time, with a great deal of implication and with a strong emotional impact.
              - ![image](https://gyazo.com/0c5beb323890a515de88c11854f289ff/thumb/1000)p.165
                  - This is once a normal diagramming process and then it is &quot;cleaned up in picture form&quot;.
          - > The meaning of a symbol mark and its utility are of great importance. I will discuss this later. Because of the importance of a symbol mark, it is difficult to create a symbol mark unless it perfectly and precisely expresses the meaning that the island as a whole is emotionally appealing to. Therefore, although it is easy in terms of time and amount of work, it is necessary to devise a symbol mark with all one's wisdom and ingenuity.
          - > When the symbols are properly placed, the meaning of the entire illustration is more well-crafted and quickly understood, both by its creator and by the audience of his explanation. Therefore, in some cases, it is better to draw the symbol mark immediately after the completion of the island drawing, and then add the relational lines. In fact, in many cases, it is more natural to draw the symbol mark from the island drawing to the symbol line than to draw the island drawing to the relationship line to the symbol mark. (p.173)
  - It should be noted that it is not always possible to create such a beautiful picture.
      - Jiro Kawakita also says, &quot;We don't always succeed.&quot;
      - It is not &quot;a random piece&quot; that goes into these cases, but &quot;the best looking or most convenient one&quot;!
          - For example, if Jiro Kawakita had a marital quarrel or was worried about his children's education policy, he would have used thinking fireworks to organize his thoughts, but such illustrations of muddy problems cannot be included in a book, can they?
