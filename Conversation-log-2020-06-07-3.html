talk.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Listen first.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>Yes, sir.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>I also created a “motivational system” a few years ago, “Why don’t you take a walk?” “Have you tried writing it down? The system suggested next actions like, “Why don’t you take a walk? While that system has quite a few fans, my side started to wonder, “Is it right to motivate people? I started to wonder if it was right to motivate them, and development has stopped. I see a large percentage of people who are on the verge of depression when I look at their input, and I wonder if services that motivate people should not exist as if it is a good thing. In other words, people who have many “things to do” and none of them are things they want to do, should not choose one of them to motivate them, but should first get away from that situation. Is it better to “help them find things they want to do that motivate them” rather than “motivate them?”
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>on the other hand
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>The “Motivation System” was a prototype that was implemented using only static content and Google Analytics without a server program, but now that the cost of server-side operation has come down, it may be possible to rebuild it with a server side. Like this chat, maybe the UI could be a chat too. I still ask questions like, “Can you finish that task in 4 hours? The composition is similar to this chat system. I was going to discuss about improving this “Kikidashi chat system,” but a new idea called “Next Action Selection chat system” was born, and maybe the two could be combined internally and become different modes. And the listening chat system is all about divergence and not convergence at all! Is it divergent thinking mode and convergent thinking mode?

<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>I want my Next Action to be decided.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What type of next action is that next action?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Hmmm, I knew this would happen. Actions to make the chat system better
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>I want my Next Action to be decided.
Is there anything else you would like to share about this Next Action?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Maybe add a chat-like UI on the browser, or convert the motivation system to chat…
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What is it that you value?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>The current listening-out chat system works rather well in the direction of divergence, but it does not allow convergence, so the more we use it, the more we lose control. If the system can also support convergence, it would be good to be able to diverge and converge while talking to the bot alone.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What is that chat system like?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>I don’t know about you, but I wonder if design firms do something like this?

Is there anything else you would like to share about this chat system?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Convergence means deciding on a next action, and we have created a support system for this in the past that has been rather well received.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>How do you know its Next Action?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>The support system will present it to you, and the one you goof on will be chosen.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What is the relationship between Nextaction and chat systems?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Right now the next action suggestions are being made in a non-chat system way, but I can make more detailed suggestions if I get more information from the chat system or some other way. It doesn’t have to be a chat system, it would be better to be able to paste a TODO list or something and have it read.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What type of chat system is that?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>After the TODO list is loaded, questions are asked about the items to encourage concretization. It is more important to have a system that asks questions than to have a chat system.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>Where is that chat system located?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>I want it to work on my phone.

How do you know this chat system?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Who am I? The user? How do I know how to create this chat system? I’m asking that and consulting the chat system.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>Where is that chat system?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>HEROKU.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>Is Next Action the same as a chat system? Is it different?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Chat System Generates Next Action
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What happens to the chat system during that Next Action?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>(First of all, listen, I wonder if you heard what I said…)
(That’s too abstract a question.)

Is there anything else about this convergence?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Now it’s only diverging, so pairing it with convergence will make it more valuable.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>How do you know its convergence?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>If you see what the machine suggests and your heart moves, you have converged.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>Is there anything else you can tell us about that machine?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>I was just talking about chat and loading to-do lists, but it would be interesting to see the data accumulate in Scrapbox.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>Where is that TODO list located?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>I’m thinking it would be great if I could import TODO lists in a text format or something like that, since people have different preferences for how they want to manage their TODO lists, and it would be even better if it supported major TODO management apps’ formats. It might be useful to have keywords bracketed and such.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>Is there anything else about that TODO list?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Maybe we could help with the process of making it itself, if we don’t have one, we could start by writing down anything that comes to mind for a minute, or filtering the list we already have on hand if it’s already too much.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What type of process is the process itself?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>The process by which TODO lists are created
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>How do you know its TODO list?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Well, if you start with “write everything down,” you don’t have to assume that the first thing on your list is a TODO list.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What is the relationship between that TODO list and convergence?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Good convergence is when the TODO list is a collection of a small number of actionable actions, and people are enthusiastic about performing those actions.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>Where is that TODO list?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>be made
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>Is convergence the same as a TODO list? Is it different?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>A TODO list or a list that is not even a TODO is given as input to the system, the system asks questions, and a good TODO list that can be enthusiastic is output.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What type of TODO list is that TODO list?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Maybe another name for “a list consisting only of actions you can be enthusiastic about,” a boring TODO list isn’t worth it.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What does that TODO list look like?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Gasoline. If the tank is filled with gasoline, it can run and run. If you put water in the tank, it can’t run. Just a little bit of water in the tank will cause the engine to go haywire. Purity is important.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What happens to your TODO list at the time of convergence?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>It turns into quality fuel.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What happens to convergence when the TODO list?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Hard to converge from nothing, need something written out, even if it’s messy.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What is the link between that convergence and the TODO list?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Hmmm. I don’t know.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What is the relationship between todo lists and enthusiasm?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>A good TODO list will generate enthusiasm.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>Is that enthusiasm the same as a TODO list? Is it different?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>No. The TODO list is the fuel, and the result of burning it in the engine is the driving force of enthusiasm.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What happens to enthusiasm when its on the TODO list?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>become more enthusiastic
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>Is there anything else you can tell us about that enthusiasm?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Enthusiasm is the most precious resource, and if we can generate it mechanically, humanity will be very productive.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What happens to your TODO list when its enthusiasm?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>New ideas come up and the TODO list gets fatter.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What is the connection between that TODO list and enthusiasm?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Overly fat TODO lists can kill enthusiasm.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What type of enthusiasm is this enthusiasm?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Enthusiasm that motivates you to take action.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>Where is your enthusiasm for this?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Well, maybe around the chest.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>Enthusiasm that motivates you to take action.
Where is this enthusiasm?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>It’s in people’s minds and drives their actions.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What is the relationship between the person and the TODO list?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Currently, machines are not yet able to generate enthusiasm, so as we leave to machines what machines can do, the remaining role for people will be to generate enthusiasm, and the actions that generate TODO lists are also not being done by machines, they have to be done by people with enthusiasm.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>How do you know its enthusiasm?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>This is not yet verbalized, Emotion.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>Currently, machines are not yet able to generate enthusiasm, so as we leave to machines what machines can do, the remaining role for people will be to generate enthusiasm, and the actions that generate TODO lists are also not being done by machines, they have to be done by people with enthusiasm.
What is this enthusiasm like?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Like dynamite. The power to break through barriers.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What is the relationship between actions and TODO lists?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>The TODO list must consist of concrete actions, and even if this current conversation has generated enthusiasm for the idea that we need a mechanism to reformulate the TODO list, it is still not a viable concrete action!
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>Is the action the same as the TODO list? Is it different?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>It’s a “good TODO list” even if there is only one specific action that can be performed, in fact, it might be better if there are no multiple actions because there is no room to think about “which one to do first”!
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What happens to your TODO list when that action is taken?
