<li>Vector search is good for ambiguous searches in natural language conversations because of the flurry of hits, but it has a high cognitive load for users because ‚Äúthe name of the company you visited in sales‚Äù or ‚Äúthe product model number‚Äù also hits ‚Äúdifferent things that look very similar‚Äù.

<li>The focus was on the ratio of investment to science and technology.</li>

<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>A: Better to search by keywords if the keywords are known, even if the vector search has good features, it is not possible to ‚Äúread the mind‚Äù, so the searcher‚Äôs linguistic ability is necessary</li>

<p>Looking Back</p>
<ul>
<li>It‚Äôs now possible to search by ‚Äúthis is what I meant‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúI must have written this ‚Äòstring‚Äô.‚Äù</li>
<li>Nishio himself is adapting to the vector search system.
<ul>
<li>Early cases search by fragments, as in ‚Äúsocial security funding scientific research‚Äù and ‚Äúhole in the wall, you can‚Äôt see it unless you get up close.‚Äù</li>
<li>As I get used to it, I‚Äôm searching for ‚Äúshort sentences that express meaning‚Äù like ‚Äúunfeasible ideas seem original,‚Äù ‚Äúkintone is a conversation around data,‚Äù and ‚Äúbias to measure only what is easy to measure.‚Äù</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The other day, when I asked a user to use this vector search while sharing the screen on Zoom, the user typed, ‚ÄúTell me about your experience of cooking for yourself,‚Äù and I thought, ‚ÄúOh, you don‚Äôt understand how to use this at all.
<ul>
<li>I don‚Äôt know the difference between a vector search and an LLM that is <a href="./Instruction-Tuning" class="internal alias" data-slug="Instruction-Tuning">Instruction Tuning</a>.</li>
<li>Maybe most people in the world don‚Äôt know the difference.</li>
<li>Only those that have undergone additional learning (<a href="./Instruction-Tuning" class="internal alias" data-slug="Instruction-Tuning">Instruction Tuning</a>) to ‚Äúregard user input as instructions and follow those instructions‚Äù will follow the instructions in the underlying language model.</li>
<li>Similar input just because ChatGPT does.</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>I see‚Ä¶it is different from ChatGPT‚Ä¶</li>

</li>
<li>The user then typed in ‚Äúdescription about cooking‚Äù and found my terrible cooking story, which is a good thing, right?
<ul>
<li>Not much vector search goodness.
<ul>
<li>Because the ‚Äúmeaning‚Äù in the query is in effect one word of ‚Äúcooking‚Äù, so it is no different from a keyword search.</li>

<li>History
- If you create a <a href="./red-link" class="internal alias" data-slug="red-link">red link</a> (an empty link) and then specify the red link, the page is now created using the results of a vector search on the link title.
<ul>
<li>This is useful
<ul>
<li>What kind of experience does it bring?
<ul>
<li>Make a link to ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôve written something like this before.‚Äù</li>
<li>Sometimes assisted here by Scrapbox‚Äôs link suggestions
<ul>
<li>For those not familiar with Scrapbox: Scrapbox runs an ambiguous search when creating a link and suggests a link destination.</li>
<li>If not, you had to use search and other methods to find them.</li>
<li>We can leave that to AI.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Further Development
<ul>
<li>When there is a good ‚Äúlong phrase‚Äù in the AI‚Äôs generation or in the past descriptions that the AI has uncovered, make it a link, like a marker.</li>
<li>Naturally, it would be a red link.
<ul>
<li>This is long enough that it is expected that ‚Äúit will not be a natural connection‚Äù</li>
<li>So we will ‚Äúred-link extension‚Äù this.</li>
<li>Until now, <a href="./Expansion-of-pertinent-judgment" class="internal alias" data-slug="Expansion-of-pertinent-judgment">Expansion of pertinent judgment</a> was done with the operation <a href="./Long-title-engraving-page" class="internal alias" data-slug="Long-title-engraving-page">Long title engraving page</a>.</li>

<li>Specific example 1
- <a href="./üåÄExchange-Form-D" class="internal alias" data-slug="üåÄExchange-Form-D">üåÄExchange Form D</a>, omni ‚Äúreaffirmed the importance of exchange in the problem-solving process.‚Äù
<ul>
<li>I didn‚Äôt know what ‚Äúthe importance of exchange in the problem-solving process‚Äù was, so I red-linked it and stretched it.</li>
<li>When OMNI said, ‚ÄúProblem solving bridges the gap between the ideal and the current situation, and the exchange of information in the process is important,‚Äù I understood, ‚ÄúI see, you mean exchange of information is exchange.‚Äù</li>
<li>I wrote about this realization in [Information exchange is exchange
<ul>
<li>(The meaning of this realization is probably not conveyed, but that is a case study for later, so I won‚Äôt explain it here.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After a while, ‚Äú[Is the exchange style of knowledge exchange A?‚Äù The question arose</li>
<li>I extended the ‚Äú<a href="./Public-as-the-object-of-the-gift" class="internal alias" data-slug="Public-as-the-object-of-the-gift">Public as the object of the gift</a>‚Äù that was created there as a red link, and it gave me a lot of examples.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It can be called ‚Äú<a href="./search-with-description" class="internal alias" data-slug="search-with-description">search with description</a>‚Äù.
<ul>
<li>Search with explanation of why it was shortlisted.</li>
<li>Instead of a human directly reading the search results, the AI reads them first and writes a description.</li>

<ul>
<li>Especially on Scrapbox, the action of ‚Äúread a page, and if the thought inspires you, write on that page‚Äù is afforded.
<ul>
<li>Then, when a human sees an ‚ÄúAI-generated page‚Äù and makes a post, it seems strange that the human‚Äôs post is not picked up because it was originally an AI-generated page, so the distinction between AI-generated and non-AI-generated pages is abandoned.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For example, it is possible to know who updated each line, so if you create a dedicated account for the AI, it is possible to ‚Äúignore AI-generated content and use only human-written content‚Äù.
<ul>
<li>As to why I haven‚Äôt done it, I don‚Äôt feel the need to do it‚Ä¶</li>
<li>I feel like I might discover something new if I try it, but I have a lot of other things I want to try, so it‚Äôs not a priority and hasn‚Äôt been started.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On the other hand, I also explicitly think it‚Äôs a bad idea to write the vector search results directly into Scrapbox as AI output.
<ul>
<li>It‚Äôs OK up to the point where a human reads it, but once it‚Äôs in the search results again, there‚Äôs a feeling that the value of the ‚Äútitle to content mapping‚Äù is spoiled.</li>

<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/omni/icon" alt="omni.icon" height="19.5"/>To improve knowledge productivity, we need to understand the importance of collaboration and the importance of sharing tacit knowledge prior to planning.‚Äù

<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/gpt/icon" alt="gpt.icon" height="19.5"/>To use knowledge effectively to get things done, it‚Äôs important for everyone to work together, to share information, and for everyone to share their own experiences and tips before the actual work begins.‚Äù
<ul>
<li>Most people will find it easier to understand.</li>
<li>From my subjective point of view, it is clearly degrading. Maybe GPT4 doesn‚Äôt understand the cooporation correctly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>PS: I‚Äôd like to explain this a little more.
<ul>
<li>In Ikujiro Nonaka‚Äôs SECI model, ‚Äúcollaboration‚Äù refers to the sharing of ‚Äútacit knowledge‚Äù that is difficult to verbalize through ‚Äúsharing the same experience,‚Äù such as through joint work, without the use of language.
<ul>
<li>So I get the feeling that you ‚Äúdon‚Äôt get it at all‚Äù when you describe it as ‚Äúsharing information, experience, and tips‚Äù.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In light of this, this statement can be interpreted as ‚Äúbefore making a linguistic plan, it is necessary to first share a nonverbal experience through cooporation.</li>
<li>And in the context in which this statement came up, we were talking about increasing intellectual productivity through AI.</li>
<li>Before any linguistic planning can be done on how to improve intellectual productivity with AI, it must first be collaborative.</li>
<li>This is the first step in the process. One form of this is to let AI live in the place where I usually do my intellectual production by creating a system that allows AI to work on its own, instead of humans giving it instructions every time and AI responding to them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Example 2 (‚ÄúInformation exchange is an exchange‚Äù as you just said)
<ul>
<li>I found ‚Äúinformation exchange is exchange‚Äù to be an important realization, but I think most people probably don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs so interesting about it.</li>
<li>When I see the word ‚Äúexchange,‚Äù I connect it to the context of ‚ÄúYukito Emiya‚Äôs <a href="./interchange-format" class="internal alias" data-slug="interchange-format">interchange format</a>.</li>
<li>Very rough description.
<ul>
<li>Exchange Form A: Giving a Gift in Return</li>
<li>Exchange Form B: Obedience and Protection</li>
<li>Exchange Form C: Pay the price and get the goods</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Information exchange is an exchange‚Äù is a realization that ‚Äúsince information is also a good, information exchange can be considered within the framework of Gyoto Emorya‚Äôs exchange theory.
<ul>
<li>‚ÄúSo [Is the exchange style of knowledge exchange A? ‚ÜíNo, I think information sharing using <a href="./a-place-of-sharing" class="internal alias" data-slug="a-place-of-sharing">a place of sharing</a> instead of DM is <a href="./New-Exchange-Style" class="internal alias" data-slug="New-Exchange-Style">New Exchange Style</a> because there is <a href="./Public-as-the-object-of-the-gift" class="internal alias" data-slug="Public-as-the-object-of-the-gift">Public as the object of the gift</a>, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù This led to the realization that</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Supplemental (if time permits)
<ul>
<li>Technically, I think that by loading a lot of the prompts with RAGs, the ‚Äúchat-ness‚Äù is gone and it‚Äôs closer to a ‚Äúsummary task,‚Äù and the pressure by <a href="./RLHF" class="internal" data-slug="RLHF">RLHF</a> to make the expression more palatable to the general public is down.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>I feel that the style of writing is a major factor in the speed of comprehension, and I have the impression that a sentence that is easier for me to read is generated when I give my own sentence to GPT to generate, rather than just having GPT generate the sentence for me.
<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Indeed, it may be that OMNI is easier for me to read because it speaks in my style. In the end, it may be that AI assistants are more productive for each individual if they are personalized to the individual.</li>

<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>A: Once you read a book, you don‚Äôt remember every detail.
<ul>
<li>I started using vector search and it unearths things like blog posts I wrote 8 years ago, but I wrote them myself and I don‚Äôt remember them.</li>
<li>Even a book you read hits you unexpectedly and you say, ‚ÄúWhoa, did I read that in this book? Oh, it sure does! I didn‚Äôt pay much attention to it when I read it before!‚Äù It‚Äôs like that.</li>
<li>It is said that a good book should be read many times, but in essence, it is an attribute on the part of the reader to be able to accept what is written.</li>
<li>In that sense, it would be a great reading experience to come across relevant pages of books related to ‚Äúwhat I am interested in now‚Äù and read them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>Q: Is the identification of whether the source is from you or someone else based on whether it is a public or private Omni? Or is it based on the content?
<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>A: In that sense, both are the same now that the private Omni does not contain self-derived data.
<ul>
<li>I like the idea of experimenting with mixing the two.</li>

<ul>
<li>In the realm of personal knowledge management, there is a belief that a short page on a single topic is preferable

</li>
<li>Similar to the [single responsibility principle</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>So the act of extracting a ‚Äúsingle topic‚Äù from a ‚Äúpage with multiple topics mixed in‚Äù is performed.</li>
<li>In Scrapbox, this can be done by selecting multiple lines and choosing New Page from the balloon menu.
<ul>
<li>This is commonly known as ‚Äúcutting out‚Äù and as the name suggests, ‚Äúcutting‚Äù and creating new pages and linking them to each other
<ul>
<li>Whether ‚Äúcut‚Äù or ‚Äúcopy‚Äù is better is debatable, and I don‚Äôt always think cut is better either, there is value in keeping lecture materials readable through.
<ul>
<li>With the minutes being placed in groupware, or something like that, users would be resistant to editing them.</li>
<li>Scrapbox‚Äôs philosophy of ‚Äú<a href="./Not-a-warehouse-for-dead-text." class="internal alias" data-slug="Not-a-warehouse-for-dead-text.">Not a warehouse for dead text.</a>‚Äù would say, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt use it that way.‚Äù</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Behavior due to the fact that it is a vector search for fragments engraved in chunks
<ul>
<li>I‚Äôm chopping at 500 tokens right now, which is about the size of a page in a book.</li>
<li>With chat logs, it‚Äôs not an entire thread or one specific person‚Äôs statement, but a unit of ‚Äúseveral exchanges‚Äù.</li>
<li>The search returns ‚Äúthe most dense mentions of the topic‚Äù in a long conversation.</li>
<li>A human discards the unwanted parts of that chunk, picks the relevant ones around it, or writes a new opinion inspired by it and creates a new page, which is beneficial.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Scrapbox is designed to afford cutouts, which is beneficial when combined with LLM</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>Cutting it out could be a problem because you lose the context of the timeline.

<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>It‚Äôs better to put it in this system because it doesn‚Äôt speak to you when it‚Äôs piled up, right?

<ul>
<li>7/29: AI writes to Scrapbox, introducing the concept of Scrapbox Agents.</li>
<li>Early to mid-August: Omoikane study group, discussion on working with AI, writing research notes with AI, evolution of vector search, and topics on handling AI-generated pages.</li>
<li>Mid to end of August: topics related to updating and search, taking into account multi-head, page memory, and user cognitive load.</li>
<li>Beginning of September: Explore AI-user interaction, note management, and relevance between different content.</li>
<li>Mid-September: various topics related to multi-head thinking, the intellectual production techniques of engineers, and working with AI.</li>
<li>Late September: LLM vs. other models, discussion on human concepts, optimal use of Scrapbox, and feedback on non-public tools.
Overall, this period seems to focus on Scrapbox and AI integration, particularly the concepts of vector search and multi-heading, and AI thinking and interaction with the user.</li>
