*1330442259*Diary of tax return
Now it's that season again.
In the meantime, I'm going to go back and read my diary from last year. &lt;a href='http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nishiohirokazu/20110227/1298819036'>e-Tax Diary (Failure)&lt;/a>. &lt;a href='http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nishiohirokazu/20110305/1299329458'>e-Tax Diary (Completed)&lt;/a>.

&lt;hr>

I didn't think last year's user identification number would be needed again this year. It is not recorded anywhere. Is it okay to say I'm using eTax for the first time and get a new one?

Enter the address and other information.

[f:id:nishiohirokazu:20120302054325p:image]

Why not say that first.... But well, I'll just say &quot;yes&quot;. It's too dull to wait for it to come in the mail.

&lt;hr>

...I cannot find my IC card. (physical).

Well, I'm glad I just found out (Friday morning at 6am). I guess I should just go to the ward office today and get them.

>>
Please obtain a Basic Resident Registration Card at the counter of the city hall, etc. where you have your certificate of residence, and submit the &quot;Application for Issuance of Electronic Certificate&quot; and other documents to obtain an electronic certificate (an electronic certificate based on the Public Personal Certification Service) (a fee is required). (A fee is required).
&lt;&lt;

&lt;a href='http://www.nta.go.jp/tetsuzuki/shinkoku/shotoku/tokushu/jyunbi.htm'>Preparations for using e-Tax: Special Feature for 2011 Tax Return&lt;/a>.

As a side effect, I discarded all the cards and other stuff I didn't need and had one less card slot.

&lt;hr>

When I went to the ward office and told them that I had lost my basic resident registration card, I was asked to fill out four forms: a notification of revocation of the basic resident registration card, a notification of revocation of the electronic certificate, a notification of issuance of the basic resident registration card, and a notification of issuance of the electronic certificate. However, what I had to write was almost the same. The only things I had to write were my name, address, date of birth, and telephone number. I was told that it would take about 50 minutes, but it was completed in 45 minutes. I was done in 45 minutes.

Incidentally, the Basic Resident Registration Card is valid for 10 years and does not expire when moving within the ward, but expires when moving out of the ward. The electronic certificate is valid for 3 years and expires when you move out of the ward. I got married last July and moved within the ward at that time, so my digital certificate actually expired at that time. So I did not need to report the revocation of my digital certificate. If I hadn't lost my card, I would have put it in and then made a fuss about &quot;Why can't I use my digital certificate!&quot; If I had not lost the card, I might have put it in and then made a fuss about &quot;Why can't I use my digital certificate? I'm glad I lost it.

Last year, I made too many mistakes in my password and was locked out and had to reset my password, but this year I got an easy-to-understand quick reference table, probably because many people did. &lt;a href='http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nishiohirokazu/20120302/1330653299'>Quick guide to e-Tax related numbers&lt;/a>.

&lt;hr>

Now, start Safari again in 32-bit mode and insert the card. The &quot;Keychain is asking for JPKI password&quot; dialog box appears, but what it asks for is the PIN for the digital certificate. Last year, I entered my PC password, my resident card PIN, and my eTax PIN that I had just set up, etc., and it locked me out.

[f:id:nishiohirokazu:20120303102316p:image]

I try to log in with the user identification number and password I created yesterday. They say, &quot;We searched but couldn't find it.&quot; Oh, that's right. I thought the identification number was recorded when it was displayed, but maybe it is not. So I made a new one. The address must not contain one-byte alphanumeric characters, especially not hyphens, so be careful when entering the address.

I got error code AF0020-803.

https://www.keisan.nta.go.jp/survey/publish/38279/faq/38373/faq_44200.php It says to set the JDK so that 32-bit is preferred!

[f:id:nishiohirokazu:20120303095732p:image]

It says to use the back button to go back, but the back button is not shown. Hmmm.

I should save the current state and reboot once I've messed with the JDK settings and such.

&lt;hr>

I got an HJS0407E error. Oh, it's because the JPKI client is not running.

&lt;hr>

I was able to do it. I am finally ready to enter the body of the document. And last year, I mistakenly pressed the pink button here. It says in small letters that if you have business income, you have to press the blue button here. It doesn't say it, but it's also for miscellaneous income.

[f:id:nishiohirokazu:20120303102447p:image]

&lt;hr>

Hmmm, first I make a journal entry for business income and expenses, so I put the withheld manuscript fees in there and said, &quot;Oh, where am I going to write the withholding tax amount?&quot; but this is to be written on the income tax return.

and remove it from the income and expense journal and move it to the miscellaneous income section of the tax return (mistake).

When I click on the link for business income instead of miscellaneous income, I reconsider that I should write it here because it says &quot;If you have income that is withheld as business income, please enter the following items based on the payment record, etc.&quot;. I will write it.

[f:id:nishiohirokazu:20120303115235p:image]

Let's see, that means you're supposed to write on the income/expense journal irrespective of whether taxes are withheld or not, and again on the tax return.

It's done, it's done, it's done.

&lt;hr>
I'm having a hard time deciding what to write in the &quot;occupation&quot; section, which only has 11 characters. The highest percentage of my income is &quot;company employee,&quot; so I'm tempted to write that on my tax return, but I wonder if writing &quot;company employee&quot; on the income/expense journal for business income is indeed strange...

Well, there is no penalty even if there is something wrong there, and the bureaucrats probably don't have the time to turn it in every time, so I'll just take it as it comes.
&lt;/body>
