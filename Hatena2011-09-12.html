*1315788897*&quot;Beyond Freud&quot; leverage memo
Erich Fromm's commentary on Freud's greatness and its limitations. It is interesting that the talk begins with &quot;Chapter 1: The Limits of Scientific Knowledge, Section 1: Why Every New Theory Is Invariably Flawed.&quot;

Creative thought is always &quot;critical thought&quot; that removes existing illusions, but it must be expressed and considered in the thought, common sense, and logical system of the time. This becomes a fixed idea that hinders the correct development of theory. In Freud's case, there are two fixed ideas. The first is materialism, which was widely accepted at the time, as described in books such as &quot;Power and Materiality&quot; (B√ºchner). B√ºchner's argument was that &quot;there is no force without material,&quot; and Freud was influenced by this argument to believe that &quot;there can be no strong mental force that cannot manifest a specific physiological root. The second was patriarchy. Freud believed that it was natural for men to dominate women, so much so that when John Stuart Mill, whom Freud greatly admired, wrote of gender equality, &quot;It is sheer madness. This strongly associated masculinity with power and led to concepts such as the &quot;Oedipus Complex&quot; as a rebellion against power (the father) in the home.

There are several concepts that Freud made that were revolutionary at the time. It would be difficult to write about all of them, so I will summarize here only those marked with an asterisk (*).

- Discovering the unconscious (not everything is conscious)
- Transference (a phenomenon in which a patient develops the same feelings toward a physician that he or she had toward a parent as a child).
- Narcissism (not a sexual perversion, but a complement to one of the instincts of self-preservation)
- (*)Personality Classification
- Significance of childhood (the idea that childhood experiences influence who we are today)
- (*) Interpretation of dreams
- (*)Instinct theory

The first interesting point about Freud's personality structure is that he attempted to classify personality as a system rather than as individual traits. There are four types of love: oral love=acceptance, oral love=sadism, anal love=sadism, and genital love. And these are, in essence, the developmental stages of &quot;what you want can be given,&quot; &quot;what you want must be taken,&quot; &quot;what you want must be protected from being taken,&quot; and &quot;the adult who has transcended these stages. Isn't it too hypothetical and unnecessarily complicated a model to construct a theory assuming that all of these personalities are derived from sexual desire? This is Fromm's argument. He argues that the influence of environment may also be significant, citing examples from studies of indigenous cultures, for example, that aggressive personalities tend to develop in tribes that are poor and cannot survive without depriving each other, while cooperative personalities tend to develop in environments that are rich and do not require deprivation.

Secondly, Fromm's opinion on dream diagnosis is that it is &quot;a working hypothesis&quot; because it is not self-contradictory. Even if it were true that &quot;many dreams are symbolic fulfillment of desires,&quot; he feels that Freud was dogmatic in making this the case that &quot;all dreams are~.&quot;

With regard to instinct theory, especially the &quot;death instinct,&quot; Freud originally took the position of dualism and saw life as a battle between two opposing forces. Initially, what he was fighting about in this dualism was &quot;sex&quot; and &quot;self-preservation,&quot; but then he introduced the concept of &quot;narcissism,&quot; and the instinct of self-preservation became a type of sex (libido). This would be an affirmation of Jung's &quot;libido represents all mental energy,&quot; which he was fighting against as heresy. So the &quot;death instinct&quot; was introduced.

Although Freud's theory has many problems that stand out nowadays, such as the following, it is commendable that he struggled to take a &quot;scientific approach&quot; to the &quot;psyche,&quot; which at the time was vague and ambiguous. Freud proposed the concept of the unconscious in 1895, when the Wright Brothers had not yet succeeded in manned flight. Today, measurement technology has advanced to the point where we can observe activity in the brain, but it wasn't until 1929, some 35 years later, that it was finally confirmed that humans have brain waves. If Freud had been around today, he would have been overjoyed by the abundance of data.

After all, it's a 5-day test, but I've done it in 4 days.

Let's start with the objective. I read the book (&quot;Beyond Freud&quot;, hardcover, 191 pages), which I had bought but left piled up, in four days at 25 minutes a day, and blogged its contents. &lt;a href='http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nishiohirokazu/20110912/1315788897'>'Beyond Freud' Leverage Memo&lt;/a>

Thoughts. A stack of books does not create value. I don't think I absorbed 100% of what was written in the book, but I think I absorbed the important parts. How much I absorbed cannot be objectively measured, and there is no way for me to measure it. I would like someone in the know to tell me whether I learned more or less in less than two hours. Well, at least it's a good thing that the &quot;paper trash piled up in my room&quot; has turned into &quot;knowledge in my brain&quot;. I still have a lot of books to read, so I will continue to process them in this way.

I had a preconceived notion of Freud as a &quot;dirty old man who links everything to sexuality,&quot; but now that I understand why he tried to link all human behavior to sexual desire, I have a lot of sympathy for him. It's more like sympathy... If only he had been born in an age when brain waves could be measured or experiments could be done with monkeys, his ideals would have been easier to achieve.
