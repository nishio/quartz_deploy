Interesting” Exploratory Net: Examples</p>
<p>2022-08-09
What do I find interesting?</p>
<ul>
<li>unexplored junior</li>
<li>at first
<ul>
<li>Human networking among mentors by working on common themes</li>
<li>The human network is also a product</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Human network among creators</li>
<li>New perspectives brought by creators</li>
<li>human bug
<ul>
<li>If you understand the bug, you can fix it.
<ul>
<li>but maybe not.</li>
<li>Certain bugs can’t be helped.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Intellectual Production
<ul>
<li>Enhancing one’s intellectual production capacity with software
<img src="https://gyazo.com/20b70c797644b671573aaacd79c845dc/thumb/1000" alt="image"/></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Three disparate branches were created. What is the connection between these?</li>
<li>Connected.
<ul>
<li><img src="https://gyazo.com/043016533d9ada6b8ae84d98a9727482/thumb/1000" alt="image"/></li>
<li>In other words, “I can fix bugs when I understand them” is related to “strengthening myself,” and the decline in “antenna sensitivity” due to aging is related to the younger creator’s perspective being more interesting.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>additional idea</p>
<ul>
<li>Bugs that make it impossible to accept critical information about you.</li>
<li>Hardware degradation</li>
<li>I can’t fix it because I can’t get the information to fix it.</li>
<li>Intellectual production through dialogue
<ul>
<li>A New Form of Communication
<ul>
<li>Scrapbox</li>
<li>Minecraft</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Remove humans from the dialogue
<ul>
<li>Keichobot</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://gyazo.com/a94eacf4fd0ec235335a39a9e3551045/thumb/1000" alt="image"/></p>
<p>The word “Scrapbox” came out of the development of the association.</p>
<ul>
<li>Because the communication on Scrapbox that takes place in the well project is interesting.
<ul>
<li>After writing this, I realized that I find Scrapbox interesting regardless of communication in the first place.</li>
<li>I guess when it becomes commonplace in his mind, it doesn’t come out in words.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>How interesting is Minecraft?</p>
<ul>
<li>Cooperation on common goals</li>
<li>Competition is no fun.</li>
<li>Cooperation on a common goal is also related to the Junior Unexplored.
<ul>
<li>I made this!” Wow!” is good</li>
<li>Is the manufacturing group interesting?
- [An ideal factory that is free, vigorous, and joyful</li>
<li>Freedom and open-mindedness are important
<ul>
<li>Well, we’re not all going to carry out the plan in advance.</li>
<li>It’s interesting to see people who can make things on their own make things they like.</li>
<li>Relationship to “Cooperation on Common Goals”

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What is interesting about Keichobot?</p>
<ul>
<li>The symbolic modeling that originated in the first place is interesting.
<ul>
<li>But doing so with humans is expensive.</li>
<li>The program can always be used as a substitute.
What’s so interesting about Scrapbox?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Knowledge Network</li>
<li>Associative Support</li>
<li>Scrapbox also supports intellectual production through software</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://gyazo.com/9ebab5a52f20863fcdadfad6f9e2a8ce/thumb/1000" alt="image"/></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>About the awkwardly enclosed “Kozaneba” and “Thinking Fireworks</p>
<ul>
<li>And that’s exactly what I’m spending my time on right now.</li>
<li>It should be more verbalized what’s interesting.</li>
<li>Maybe we’ll do it as a new net once we’ve partitioned it in its current form.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lower Right Issue</p>
<ul>
<li>Used to call it “[problems caused by the elderly (esp. gerontocracy, and elderly people’s control over the young).”
<ul>
<li>The term is not appropriate because the disease occurs at any age.</li>
<li>The metaphor <a href="./smelly-person" class="internal alias" data-slug="smelly-person">smelly person</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The most recent proposal is “metacognitive ataxia.”
<ul>
<li>Metacognition of one’s own cognition is broken.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>I still think Kozaneba and fireworks should be developed a little more.</p>
<ul>
<li>Kozaneba was convinced that the KJ method and the Kozane method were beneficial in practice, but the cost of doing it on paper was too high, so he started to convert it to electronic format.
<ul>
<li>Functions not possible with paper
<ul>
<li>Open and close in an instant</li>
<li>Make the important ones bigger.</li>
<li>join the lines</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fireworks to Think was proposed by Jiro Kawakita himself as a practical application of the KJ method.
<ul>
<li>Hard to do with physics.</li>
<li>This is also due to the difficulty of “connecting the lines”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I’m beginning to understand, I mean, I’m trying to create a “way of thinking for the next 50 years.”
<ul>
<li>Update on Jiro Kawakita’s “Idea Method” and “KJ Method</li>
<li>I’ve written about this story in The Engineer’s Guide to Intellectual Production.</li>
</ul>

<li><a href="./human-enhancement" class="internal alias" data-slug="human-enhancement">human enhancement</a>
To begin with, the KJ method is a way to get thoughts out of your head.</li>
<li>Training to recognize thoughts

<p>I felt like I had it all worked out, so I showed it to people and explained it to them.

</ul>
</li>
<li>Jiro Kawakita’s policy is to avoid crossing lines as much as possible, but it’s getting out of control.
<ul>
<li>What should we do?</li>
<li>The principle of “write down your thoughts so you don’t have to remember them in your brain” is probably stronger than “it’s better if the lines don’t cross, let’s draw them.”
<ul>
<li>Jiro Kawakita used clips to express relationships, so intersections were difficult to achieve; in Kozaneba, intersections are not a problem, and longer distances are rendered thinner.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The purpose of doing this work is “to explore what makes you interesting, to understand and put into words your values</li>
<li>I want to understand the structure of the system” that appeared in two places 180 degrees opposite is very important
<ul>
<li>Don’t throw it away just because you can’t express yourself well with “the method of expression you are currently using.</li>

<li>The title is written in a messy handwriting due to the difficulty of writing it, but I’ll text it here because it’s likely to become unreadable over time.
<ul>
<li>If the observed facts are different from our current understanding, it’s an opportunity for better understanding.</li>
<li>Fresh stimulus you never thought of</li>
<li>I want to understand the world.</li>
<li>The world is changing rapidly and we need to constantly update our understanding.</li>
<li>The future can be made by making something that even one moving person likes.</li>
<li>If you don’t create a place to have fun and play with young people, you’ll either end up in a senior citizens’ club or become a lonely uncle.</li>
<li>I made this!” “Wow! I like a free-spirited and joyful manufacturing group that does</li>
<li>Teamwork arising from stand-up rather than the execution of a preconceived plan</li>
<li>A mechanism to create a human network among mentors by working together toward a common goal</li>
<li>It is interesting to see the human network among creators grow as well.</li>
<li>Aging deteriorates antenna sensitivity and flexibility to accept</li>
<li>I thought if we understood the human bug, we could fix it, but some things can’t be helped.</li>
<li>Metacognitive ataxia is a symptom of a broken metacognition of one’s own cognition; it cannot be fixed because one cannot understand one’s own cognitive defects.</li>
<li>We used to call them “old people,” but since they occur regardless of age, we’ve changed it to “stinkers.</li>
<li>I want to strengthen people’s intellectual productivity.</li>
<li>KJ method is a meta-cognitive exercise</li>
<li>Thinking Fireworks is a practical application of the KJ method by Jiro Kawakita, but difficult to do on paper.</li>
<li>Looking over and finding connections = understanding</li>
<li>Update on the way of thinking for the next 50 years, starting with “The Intellectual Production of Engineers.”</li>
<li>KJ method and Kozane method are useful but paper is expensive, so we created Kozaneba.</li>
<li>Digitization allows “connecting lines,” which is difficult to do with paper.</li>
<li>Good dialogue promotes intellectual production, the method is symbolic modeling, and the tool is Keichobot.</li>
<li>Preparing a human interlocutor is expensive; a program can always be used as a substitute.</li>
<li>A New Form of Communication</li>

<p>The above list, which I wrote by text while looking at the island dori, was more fruitful for me than writing by hand.</p>

<li>What do I find interesting?”</li>
<li>After thinking about this question by doing expedition nets (thinking fireworks), I realized that the important keyword is “I want to understand the world”.</li>
<li>I want to understand the world, and when I do, I find it interesting.” fits in when you want to explain it in an easy way.</li>
<li>On the other hand, a closer look reveals that there are two elements in this “wanting to understand the world”</li>
<li>The first element is “I want to gain a better understanding by strengthening my intellectual production capacity”
<ul>
<li>He believes that the human “ability to understand things” is a skill that can be strengthened.
<ul>
<li>Better understanding” can be achieved by devising tools and methods</li>
<li>Among people of equal innate ability, more or less “ingenuity in tools and methods” is manifested as a difference in comprehension.</li>
<li>(This “understanding of understanding” sprouted around 2010-06-16 <a href="./There-are-different-kinds-of-knowledge." class="internal alias" data-slug="There-are-different-kinds-of-knowledge.">There are different kinds of knowledge.</a> until 2018-10-05 [Why invest in intellectual production techniques? It grew into a clear belief)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This “methods and tools for understanding” need to be improved.
<ul>
<li>I came across the KJ method at a certain point in my life and found it very useful as a “method for understanding information from a bird’s eye view.</li>
<li>As I used it for subsequent lecture material preparation, writing, etc., I became more and more convinced that this should be improved.</li>
<li>In the past half century, the environment surrounding human beings has changed dramatically, including computers and the Internet. Methods and tools created half a century ago have not been utilized.</li>
<li>There were many wise men in the past, but the post-computer wise man will understand better than the pre-computer wise man, because “among men of equal innate ability, the greater or lesser ingenuity of tools and methods will manifest itself as a difference in understanding.</li>
<li>I am very close to this opportunity. I want to go further and see what I can see.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I think the key word is “new form of communication.
<ul>
<li>This is an area that needs to be explored and clarified further down the road.</li>
<li>Keichobot is a programmed version of the coaching technique of “getting people to talk without telling them what they think,” a disruptive innovation with an inexpensive solution of inferior quality where the use of human coaching technicians would be too expensive.</li>
<li>Synchronous asynchronous communication eliminates the boundary between the excitement of synchronous communication and the long-term value of asynchronous communication, what is being done in the Scrapbox of the unexplored junior will bear fruit in five to ten years that is unforeseen at this time, and we want to see it! I want to see it.
<ul>
<li>Scrapbox is a great fit with the original concept of the unexplored community of “cooperative stand-up for a common goal, rather than following a pre-planned plan” to create new things.</li>
<li>The early Unexplored Junior was, for me, “an attempt to reproduce the structures that emerged in the Unexplored Youth alumni community. I think this attempt is producing more than expected (I wrote about this “understanding of Unexplored” in 2011 <a href="./Unexplored-as-a-network-formation-system" class="internal alias" data-slug="Unexplored-as-a-network-formation-system">Unexplored as a network formation system</a>).</li>
<li>Unexpected gains here lead to another stem about “understanding the world”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The second element is “I want to understand the ever-changing and up-to-date world
<ul>
<li>The world changes, so to understand it correctly we must constantly update our understanding.</li>
<li>To do so, I need a “fresh stimulus” that differs from my current understanding</li>
<li>To do this, we must create a place where we can have fun and play with people who are creating new things
<ul>
<li>The future is not made in a rigid and serious manner, but by those who can make things on their own, who make things out of their own ideas, and by those around them who are amused by them.</li>
<li>It is important to focus on the new things that emerge in such places, and to know and integrate new ways of seeing things, rather than judging only from one’s own point of view.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We need to design these places so that they are interesting to me, but also continue to be interesting to others.</li>
</ul>
</li>
