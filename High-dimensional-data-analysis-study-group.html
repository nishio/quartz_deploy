<li>Actually, my PhD research 20 years ago was one of the extensions of SOM, so when I told ChatGPT to write a history of nonlinear dimensionality reduction and this came up, I was like, ‚ÄúWhoa, a familiar face!
<ul>
<li>ChatGPT explains that it‚Äôs ‚Äúbased on a neuroscientific approach, mapping data onto a low-dimensional grid,‚Äù and well, in general, that‚Äôs not wrong, but it‚Äôs a ‚Äúmodel inspired by the neural connections in the brain,‚Äù which is common at this time, and it‚Äôs so close that it no longer has much to do with the behavior in the brain.

<li>Summary of this section
<ul>
<li>PCA is a classical dimensionality reduction method from 1901</li>
<li>Nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods have been studied for many years because of the disadvantages of being linear</li>
<li>Right now it‚Äôs considered a good idea to use the 2018 UMAP.</li>

<p>My experience so far has been that Polis tends to become less and less divided into clusters as it progresses.</p>
<ul>
<li>I didn‚Äôt want all the clusters to be separated at the end of this poll map.</li>
<li>So I was considering a version that uses non-linear UMAP instead of dimensionality reduction using the original Polis PCA.</li>
<li>In the experiment of the public opinion map, the ‚Äútendency for the clusters to become less divided as they progress‚Äù was not observed.
<ul>
<li>This phenomenon may not be due to an increase in the number of voting users, but rather to the fact that the opinion space is becoming more highly dimensioned as users contribute new opinions</li>

<p>As a preliminary experiment, I visualized the 2022 Upper House election data (<a href="./Joint-research-by-Taniguchi-Laboratory,-University-of-Tokyo-and-Asahi-Shimbun" class="internal alias" data-slug="Joint-research-by-Taniguchi-Laboratory,-University-of-Tokyo-and-Asahi-Shimbun">Joint research by Taniguchi Laboratory, University of Tokyo and Asahi Shimbun</a>) analyzed by PCA using <a href="./UMAP" class="internal" data-slug="UMAP">UMAP</a> before the public opinion map data were available ( 592 respondents, 42 questions)</p>
<ul>

<li>The PCA is almost just an ellipse if you look at the dots.
<ul>
<li>The party is surrounded by <a href="./Convex-Hull" class="internal alias" data-slug="Convex-Hull">Convex Hull</a> and painted in color because the meaning is not so clear as it is.</li>
<li>This is what ‚ÄúPCA will no longer separate clusters‚Äù means</li>
<li>However, it is not divided into separate sections, but it seems to be very interesting, and Mr. Yasuno introduced it at the Keynote of <a href="./Code-for-Japan-Summit-2024" class="internal alias" data-slug="Code-for-Japan-Summit-2024">Code for Japan Summit 2024</a> on 2024-11-16.</li>

<li>Advantage is that it is PCA, so the axes make sense.
<ul>
<li>Non-linear methods make the current interpretation impossible because the axis bends all over the place.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The UMAP analysis is very clearly divided into clusters compared to the PCA analysis, which is almost one cluster of ellipses.</p>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Some islands are dense, occupied by a particular political party, while others are a mixture of several parties
<ul>
<li>In other words, when there are parties A, B, and C, we tend to think that the division of opinion is between the parties, but in fact the division is between extremists and moderates within the parties.</li>

<li>This is more of a problem with interpreting DBSCAN ‚Äúoutliers‚Äù as ‚Äúdata that is discarded because it is an outlier that is far away‚Äù and should be interpreted as ‚Äúdata that is between two clusters and hard to say which side it is on‚Äù.

<li>The greater the amount of data that is neither for nor against, the more reddened it is.</li>
<li>The ‚Äúcluster-like dense clusters‚Äù were collections of data with few missing values, and the surrounding complex and meaningful shapes were data with many missing values.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Originally, this data was set to <code>matrix.dropna(thresh=3)</code> (only keep the data with 3 or more missing data), but when I changed this to <code>matrix.dropna(thresh=8)</code>, the UMAP result was as follows</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="https://gyazo.com/cfdedf73e89a82d60ef898acd424606f/thumb/1000" alt="image"/></li>
<li>Almost all of the complex shapes were artifacts caused by missing values.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maybe it‚Äôs like this:.</p>
<ul>
<li>The process of filling in missing values with averages has created a very strong cluster of ‚Äúpeople who hardly vote at all‚Äù.</li>
<li>Those who voted properly a lot are scattered in the higher dimensional space, forming a ‚Äúthin, clear, boundaryless mass‚Äù.</li>
<li>UMAP estimates density using the distance to the k nearest neighbor points, which interferes with the characteristics of the opposite data where the data are discrete and overlap at the same coordinates, and is recognized as ‚Äúclusters that are denser than they really are‚Äù, and UMAP attempts to isolate and visualize the characteristic clusters.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have not been able to verify it thoroughly, but once I decided that the discrete value opposite vector is not suitable for UMAP, I put this line of thinking on hold.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I discarded all the people with missing values and UMAPed the data for only one map, not the 84 dimensions of the whole map, and I was able to get a better idea.</p>

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>This also supports the hypothesis that ‚Äúthe lack of cluster separation is not a phenomenon caused by an increase in the number of voting users, but by the opinion space becoming more dimensional as users contribute new opinions‚Äù for the negative observation in <a href="./Problem-with-two-Polis-clusters" class="internal alias" data-slug="Problem-with-two-Polis-clusters">Problem with two Polis clusters</a>.

<p>Relation to the KJ method</p>
<ul>
<li>In the June <a href="./Talk-to-the-City-Study-Group" class="internal alias" data-slug="Talk-to-the-City-Study-Group">Talk to the City Study Group</a>, I also wrote about the connection with the <a href="./KJ-method" class="internal alias" data-slug="KJ-method">KJ method</a> in the appendix.

<blockquote>
<p>In his mind, he has a dogmatic principle of grouping, such as, ‚ÄúIn my opinion, it is correct to divide this paper material into three major categories: market research, quality control, and labor management. They are simply applying this dogmatic classification scheme and sifting and fitting the paper materials into a ready-made framework. This is a mere sifting and fitting of paper materials into the ready-made wakku, which completely defeats the conceptual significance of the KJ method.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a href="./Jiro-Kawakita" class="internal alias" data-slug="Jiro-Kawakita">Jiro Kawakita</a> criticized human beings for sieving, fitting into [* dogmatic classification wakugumi</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As a way to deal with this problem, I proposed the KJ method, which is to look at each piece one by one and attach it to the related pieces.</li>
<li>This is <a href="./Agglomerative-Hierarchical-Clustering" class="internal alias" data-slug="Agglomerative-Hierarchical-Clustering">Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering</a> in data science terms.</li>
<li>TTTC avoids ‚Äúdogmatic human fitting‚Äù by having machines, rather than humans, perform the clustering.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This time, the relationship with the KJ method has become even clearer.</li>
<li>Clustering in the sense of ‚Äúpartitioning‚Äù has split the data set top-down.</li>
<li>Extracting clusters with high concentration using a method like DBSCAN is almost equal to ‚Äúcollecting related things to form a group‚Äù in the KJ method</li>
<li>Leaving things that don‚Äôt fit well in a cluster without putting them in a cluster is the same as the KJ method ‚Äú<a href="./leave-monkey" class="internal alias" data-slug="leave-monkey">leave monkey</a> away‚Äù.
<ul>
<li>It is not KJ legal to say that 90% of the data will be away monkeys.</li>
<li>This phenomenon is caused by the fact that this method defines ‚Äúproximity‚Äù as ‚Äúdistance in the embedded vector space.</li>
<li>When humans do the KJ method, they are asked to find connections between things that do not seem to be connected and group them together, and they ‚Äúdiscover relationships‚Äù such as ‚ÄúThis X and Y do not seem to be connected at first glance, but they are related on <a href="./side" class="internal" data-slug="side">side</a> A.
<ul>
<li>So this is finding another meaning of ‚Äúnearness‚Äù by performing an additional operation on something that is ‚Äúfar‚Äù in the sense of ‚Äúcosine distance in the embedded vector space‚Äù.</li>
<li>I think the reason why the KJ method causes the promotion of ideas as a ‚Äúway of thinking‚Äù or ‚Äúintellectual production technique‚Äù is because it forces people to do this ‚Äúsearch for relationships.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How can a machine search for relationships that are not expressed in the distance of the embedding vector?
<ul>
<li>In my book ‚Äú<a href="./Natural-Language-Processing-with-word2vec" class="internal alias" data-slug="Natural-Language-Processing-with-word2vec">Natural Language Processing with word2vec</a>, [Similarity of concepts is not distance.</li>
<li>In this case, it may be possible to deal with the problem by randomly collapsing axes, or by collapsing axes with low contribution rate by PCA, or by collapsing axes with the closest contribution rate by reversing the idea (future experiment).</li>
<li>If you‚Äôd rather get into the LLM context, you could let LLMs ‚Äúdiscover relationships‚Äù just like humans.
<ul>
<li>I think it‚Äôs good to chop it down to an amount that will fit into the LLM context.</li>
<li>Because there is a limit to the number of labels that can fit in the human field of vision.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>KJ legal never throws away one of the away monkeys.
<ul>
<li>In order to achieve this, we need to figure out how to merge the separate monkeys into a cluster.</li>
<li>Maybe on a mere distance basis it would ‚Äúmove, but not with good results‚Äù.</li>
<li>Need to experiment to see if I can prompt the LLM to do it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The KJ method is a technique that requires a great deal of skill to begin with, and Jiro Kawakita, the world‚Äôs most experienced KJ methodner, says ‚Äú<a href="./50-KJ-method-assumes-10-hours" class="internal alias" data-slug="50-KJ-method-assumes-10-hours">50 KJ method assumes 10 hours</a>‚Äù and has done only 129 KJ sheets in 5 years because it takes too much time. I felt that the time was approaching when AI would make it an easy method.</li>
