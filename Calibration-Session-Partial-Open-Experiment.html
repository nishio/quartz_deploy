<li>What is calibration?</li>
<li>We run error correction programs during communication.</li>
<li>They intentionally avoid “taking what the other person says” and “saying what they think.”</li>
<li>I am aware of the problem that if we keep repeating this, the channels of communication will become buggy.</li>
<li>Let’s calibrate that communication by doing the “take what is said here as it is said” and “speak what you think as you think.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Mr. Tachikawa, you make it sound like these rules came first and this meeting started, but that’s not the reality.
<ul>
<li>Mr. Tachikawa wanted to chat first.</li>
<li>As the chit-chat is repeated on a regular basis, we ask, “Why does Mr. Tachikawa want to have this chit-chat meeting?</li>
<li>After trying to verbalize it, I thought this was for <a href="./calibration" class="internal" data-slug="calibration">calibration</a>, and it became “<a href="./posterior" class="internal" data-slug="posterior">posterior</a>”

  - The history of this calibration session has been three years already.
  - We got some very interesting results out of that.
  - I want to make it more powerful.
  - What is power-up?
      - How can we make it more `&quot;interesting&quot;`?
  - I'd invite another person to come over and the three of us would talk.
  - We can use clubhouses and other places to allow all kinds of people to come in.
  - Chatting while circling around Shinobazuno Pond
  - I did a lot of things.
  - The hypothesis we arrived at
      - We are all inherently low-context communicators with each other.
      - Low-contest communication first.
      - Eventually, the low-context exchanges were accumulated over a very large period of time, resulting in a very high-context exchange between the two of them.
          - For example, when Mr. Nishio says something is interesting, I say, &quot;That's interesting! That's it,&quot; and so on,
          - <img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>I don't think you get that `&quot;interesting&quot;` is in quotation marks.
              - Related: [[KJ method for &quot;interesting&quot;]].
          - <img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/立川 智也/icon" alt="立川 智也.icon" height="19.5"/>So, yeah, yeah. And now this is exactly what they say is beginning high context communication.
          - I don't know what the others are talking about and what the two of you are getting excited about.
      - I realized that this closed high context between two people is actually a lot of fun.
      - I noticed that the quality of the place changes completely when there are two people and when there are groups of three, four, or five people.
  - For me personally, I feel that intense one-on-one dialogue is more valuable than group dialogue,
  - I wonder if it is possible to create a mechanism to receive some kind of stimulus or feedback from the outside while maintaining this intense dialogue.
  - <img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>I see, you want to generate communication that is not closed to one-on-one while maintaining the status of a one-on-one dialogue.
      - That's why we decided to do this experiment.
      - As for my observation, &quot;I want to do an experiment where the first 10 minutes of the video will be open to the public,&quot; and I said, &quot;I don't really know why I want to do this, but the experiment sounds `interesting', so let's do it.
  - <img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/立川 智也/icon" alt="立川 智也.icon" height="19.5"/>The experiment that I had others participate in, there was nothing wrong with that individual, but it kind of settled in a different direction than what I had expected and hoped for.
  - Clubhouse, for example, had a lot of people coming in. We started by listening to their stories. It was like we were hosting a lecture.
  - That in itself was a lot of fun, a lot of fun, but it turned out to be not what I was expecting.
  - <img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>To use an analogy, it was like playing beach volleyball with about five other people.
      - But what these two are doing together is table tennis.
      - I'm hitting a very fast serve and doing rallies.
      - I found that if I opened the place where I was doing this rally to allow others to come in, I could not do the rally.
  - <img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/立川 智也/icon" alt="立川 智也.icon" height="19.5"/>Yes, I realized after I did it that if you want to play ping pong and you bring someone else along, it's not going to be ping pong.
  - On the other hand, &quot;we'll talk now, but we won't let others join the conversation&quot; doesn't feel right.
      - (<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/> and Mr. Tachikawa seems to feel, I don't sympathize, but I took it as an observed fact.)
          - (For example, in [[Inverted Lecture Style at the 54th Meeting of Young Scientists in Information Science]], I, as an invited speaker, and two members of the executive committee had a trilogy discussion, and the others wrote their responses in the Scrapbox, and I and the executive committee looked at the Scrapbox, and I and the organizers would look at the Scrapbox and pick up the topics as needed).
  - So, I think it would be interesting to have a dialogue first, and then release the video afterwards, if people see it and say, &quot;So that's the kind of dialogue you had.
  - Why only the first 10 minutes?
      - About 95% of what we talk about is not the kind of talk you want people to hear.
  - <img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>No, I don't know if there is a story I can share with you in the first 10 minutes of this article, but I realized it because you don't know until you realize it.
  - <img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/立川 智也/icon" alt="立川 智也.icon" height="19.5"/>We haven't talked about anything strange so far.
  - <img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>I'm not saying anything weird.
      - But as far as whether it's interesting to watch, I'm not sure.
      - Well, it's [[what the market will determine.]] not what we will determine.
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/立川 智也/icon" alt="立川 智也.icon" height="19.5"/>I should say that in turn, I started by saying I was enjoying some chatting, and then I realized that no, this was calibration, or maybe I gave some appropriate reason after the fact.
<ul>
<li>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>It’s probably an afterthought.</p>
<ul>
<li>I didn’t call it calibration at first.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>You must have been released from the disposition to continue on to the next one. something</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You didn’t read it, the most, it must have only been the first.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/立川 智也/icon" alt="立川 智也.icon" height="19.5"/>After about six months, Mr. Nishio said, “What is this association?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>About the sixth time we talked about why Mr. Tachikawa wanted to have an interview with me every month, month after month.</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/立川 智也/icon" alt="立川 智也.icon" height="19.5"/>I didn’t understand why we were together until the sixth time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/立川 智也/icon" alt="立川 智也.icon" height="19.5"/>In the beginning we were expecting a low contest, but now it is no longer us communicating with the high context.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Is it true that at the beginning of that “I was expecting a low context”?</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m afraid that’s not true.</li>
<li>You had that context, a conversation with someone with whom you shared the basic premise of “non-discriminatory communication.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/立川 智也/icon" alt="立川 智也.icon" height="19.5"/>Yes, we shared that kind of context.</p>
</li>
<li>
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>
  - Don't let words you don't understand slip through your fingers.
  - Like, &quot;When I think someone's interpretation is wrong, I go in without discovery.&quot;
</li>
<li>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/立川 智也/icon" alt="立川 智也.icon" height="19.5"/>So that was very good.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After that.

<ul>
<li>For the first 5 minutes or so, Mr. Tachikawa was giving a long explanation about this episode by himself for the viewers, and the “ping-pong rally” hadn’t started.</li>
<li>The second time around, it seems like a good idea to aim to get it into top gear as soon as possible, without explanation.</li>
<li>Thoughts after transcribing the text
<ul>
<li>When I and Mr. Tachikawa often include explanations for third-party audience members who are not present at the event when we feel that “this does not convey the message,” but it is strange because it is like “passing the ball around to the audience” when we want to play “<a href="./Table-Tennis-Rally" class="internal alias" data-slug="Table-Tennis-Rally">Table Tennis Rally</a>”. If you feel that the third party cannot understand your explanation, you can add it later in writing instead of verbally on the spot.</li>
<li>It is better to leave time management to the machine, for example, set a conference presentation timer that rings three times at 4, 7, and 10 minutes, and when the bell rings at 10 minutes, fold up the talk and stop recording.</li>
<li>A situation where the ball is on one side all the time is not a rally (= it is not right for one side to keep talking for a long time). If the “commentary on a non-existent third party” is eliminated, the time it takes for the ball to pass to the other side would be reduced, but experimentation is required.</li>
<li><a href="./Decisiveness-is-cultivated-through-training-to-focus-on-one's-emotions." class="internal alias" data-slug="Decisiveness-is-cultivated-through-training-to-focus-on-one's-emotions.">Decisiveness is cultivated through training to focus on one’s emotions.</a></li>
<li>It explicitly says at this point that “interesting” is included in the “emotion” of “focus on emotion” in this. So there is synergy with the “let’s dig into what is interesting” idea.</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/立川 智也/icon" alt="立川 智也.icon" height="19.5"/>I think you’re using “focus on the emotion” and “properly subjective” almost interchangeably.</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>I feel there is a difference.</li>
