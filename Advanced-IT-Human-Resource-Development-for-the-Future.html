<li>I think the law is stifling innovative movement. Continental law is what is written is OK and what is not written is not. Anglo-American law is based on precedents, and what is not in the precedents is tried.
salted fish (esp. salmon)</li>
<li>Japan is indeed continental law, but the Constitution says ‚Äúall men are free.‚Äù</li>
<li>The Constitution sets rules to prevent the government from becoming bloated in order not to suppress individual liberties.</li>
<li>Article 199: Whoever kills a person shall be punished by death or imprisonment for life or for not less than five years.
<ul>
<li>Legalism: Crimes are only those specified in the letter of the law; what is not written is freedom</li>
<li>And it doesn‚Äôt say, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt kill. It says, ‚ÄúIf you kill, you will be punished in this way.‚Äù</li>
<li>Thou shalt not kill‚Äù is a religion</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The same goes for the rules of soccer. What is not written in the rules is free.
<ul>
<li>Freedom to do anything except what is explicitly stated as ‚Äúnot to be done.‚Äù

<li>Incident in which I tried to analyze Suica data and was told not to use it without permission.
salted fish (esp. salmon)</li>
<li>I don‚Äôt know the details of that case, but the rules for private citizens are mutually agreed upon and made. That is the contract.
farmer</li>
<li>It was not in the contract.
salted fish (esp. salmon)</li>
<li>When it is not written in the contract, it is the letter of the law.</li>
<li>There are two patterns in the text of the law.
<ul>
<li>Anything that says what you are ‚Äúallowed to do in principle‚Äù and what you are not allowed to do (e.g., criminal law)</li>
<li>Something you think ‚Äúin principle you shouldn‚Äôt do,‚Äù but that says what you should do (e.g., copyright law)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In truth, given that society changes faster than the law, the principle OK clause is preferable.</li>
