<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>I’ve been asked to write a column about ChatGPT and I’d like to organize my thoughts by talking about it.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>What kind of “ChatGPT” is this “ChatGPT”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>This is an additional study of InstuctionGPT on top of LLM so that even the average person with no technical knowledge can pull off the results. At the time of the request, ChatGPT was the only service available, but now there is a wide variety of services, so it would be better to discuss what the LLM brings to the table rather than individual services.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>Is there anything else about that “ChatGPT”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>I was asked to write an article about ChatGPT, and I was thinking about what to write, but I realized that even if the language model is smart, the demand for “knowledge that mankind does not yet know = unspoken knowledge and putting it into words” will not disappear, and that it is inefficient if what is put into words is not promptly learned by AI So, as a natural consequence, the results of research should be open access promptly, and non-open access contributions will be negatively incentivized by not getting mentioned via AI… and I was thinking about this, and then I mentioned DeSci… I feel like I need to mention DeSci.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>How do you know its “ChatGPT”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>We know by actually using the service. The API gives you a little more insight into what’s inside. On a related note, I recently wrote an article titled “Don’t talk about ChatGPT without experiencing GPT-4.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>Where is this “ChatGPT” located?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Continued: In the end, if AI increases productivity, people will have an incentive to use AI, even if they have to pay for it, and the greater the increase in productivity, the more they will pay for AI, so AI will grant grants to publish research in AI-readable format as a public service to make itself stronger. Granting grants in a highly AI-readable format

<li>What does this “ChatGPT” look like?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Humans are similar because what’s inside is a black box and can only be known superficially through conversation.

Continued: The question of who is going to pay for DeSci, it is not necessarily a human being who pays for it, rather, if the decision-making mechanism for resource distribution becomes decentralized, it would be better to make itself a mechanism without human intervention than to have a human being as a pipe to connect to bring in funds.

<li>Is there anything else about this “DeSci”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>The question is open access or not, and with respect to that open access, there is an incentive for existing publishers to be closed and take a toll for access, and for AI development, there is an incentive for open access and for AI to read it, a clash of two business models, I think the latter is stronger.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>What is it that you value?

<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Right now, it’s mostly used in the form of humans asking questions and LLMs answering them, but we should do more with the use of LLMs asking questions of humans and eliciting information from them.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>As for “ChatGPT,” can it?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Can be done, as long as people realize the usefulness of its use.

<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>- The language model has the ability to put into words what humans do not know.</li>
<li>We need to let the AI learn that capability, and we should grant the research publication in a highly readable format for the AI in a public works manner.</li>
<li>It would be nice if the decision-making mechanism for resource allocation were decentralized.</li>
<li>The business models of open access with tolling by existing publishers and open access for AI use clash.</li>
<li>In addition to the use of LLM through question and answer, the AI should be used to elicit information from humans.</li>
<li>People should be informed about the usefulness of AI.
