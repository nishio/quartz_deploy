</ul>
<p>raw</p>
<ul>
<li>I think the combination of Regroup, which allows you to move stickies freely, and Scrapbox, which allows you to create pages with easy-to-understand titles and concise links, is the best way to do kanban work. I’m starting to get the feeling that this is the best way to work.</li>
<li>For example, we may get feedback from users, or we may think it would be nice to have a feature like this! The content that comes to mind is often not of a high enough quality to make it a TODO.</li>
<li>Use Scrapbox as a “place to write anything” rather than a “list of tasks,” and store anything that “might be relevant” to the project.</li>
<li>By bracketing the phrases that seem important, the set of information naturally begins to have a network structure.</li>
<li>For example, as a concrete example, suppose user X sends us a long comment on 2020-02-04, and we consider the question of how to handle it</li>
<li>Just put it in Scrapbox as “2020-02-04 Mr. X’s Thoughts”, and if you read it and think “this is an important keyword”, you can bracket and tag it after the fact.</li>
<li>In the process of doing so, I sometimes think, “This problem certainly needs a solution,” and then I think of a solution.</li>
<li>I’ll also write down what I think the solution should be, “This is the way to do it.” Sometimes I find a better solution when I review it after some time has passed.</li>
<li>That way, after concrete crystallization has taken place, the task is to say, “Let’s do this.</li>
<li>From this set of tasks, kanban selects one at a time and executes it.</li>
<li>Generally, the TODO sticky is moved to DOING, executed, and moved to DONE when finished, and so on.</li>
<li>Each page of Scrapbox becomes a sticky note on the Regroup, so you can kanban naturally by moving it.</li>
<li>Keep “things that are not yet TODOs” away from the TODO grouping, and “things that are somewhat related” grouped somewhat close together.</li>
<li>This area of “non-linguistic expression by distance” is a KJ legal merit, and an area of focus for Regroup.</li>
<li>When I think along the lines of “I can put Scrapbox in Regroup now and organize it, but the problem is that I can’t put it back in Scrapbox or put just the difference into Regroup when Scrapbox is updated.</li>
<li>Scrapbox is a system that puts in things that are not yet structured and promotes my future self to follow the links and find the connections, while Regroup is a system that puts in short sentences that are not yet structured and promotes my current self to find the connections by moving them around while looking at the whole thing!</li>
<li>Kanban work methods are based on the assumption that the tasks have already been cut into units of “tasks” and are a powerful mechanism to drive the tasks that are now structured without worrying about the “unstructured ones” yet.</li>
<li>If you only use kanban, you fall into the trap of “making something efficient and futile is futile”.</li>
<li>I’ve thought to the point where I’m going to create the functionality needed to do that, and I’m going to actually do it.</li>
