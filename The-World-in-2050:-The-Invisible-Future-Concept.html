<p>[U.S.A.
The U.S. is exceptional; it is growing at a higher rate than the EU and other countries, and its presence is growing. Human resources are amazing. Its birth rate is higher than Japan and Europe, and it has a strong immigration of young people with ambitions. It is also the world’s largest producer of energy and the world’s largest producer of crude oil. There is also inexpensive gas. Higher education also accounts for half of the world’s top 20 universities. Canada is also a de facto expansionary zone of the U.S. economy.</p>
<p>[Latin America
The situation is likely to remain disappointing for the foreseeable future. The murder rate in South America is high. The economy was good a century ago,</p>
<p>[Europe
EU enlargement is a success, but the Euro is a failure.</p>
<p>[United Kingdom and Ireland
English-speaking countries are likely to continue to prosper. The competitive advantage of countries where English is widely spoken is high. Common law (Anglo-American law) is also a plus. There is a clear advantage in entrepreneurial culture and higher education. Only the UK can compete with the US. There is a huge disparity. Economic disparity and health disparity are large, and education is uneven. There are also disparities in corporate performance.</p>

</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>[Germany
Admired and envied for its world-leading or near world-leading standards in automotive, pharmaceuticals, and other sectors. Leads the world in state-of-the-art manufacturing. The trade surplus is the largest in the world. On the other hand, exports are strong, but the quality of the domestic service sector is subpar. Finance and higher education are also weak.</p>
<p>[France
Luxury goods industry is strong. Luxury brands are in trouble. 6 out of 10 luxury brands in the world are in France. It has a large number of tourists and is the world’s 3rd largest arms exporter. Unemployment is high at 9% and happiness is lower than in Germany and the UK. Strict employment controls protect those already employed, but those looking for work are sacrificed.</p>
<p>[Italy
Italy has a high life expectancy but a low birth rate and a large exodus of young people. It has a high-end handicraft industry, and its luxury goods industry ranks second in the world after France. The Italian economy has grown little since the beginning of the 21st century, due to the introduction of the euro. This is due to the introduction of the euro.</p>
<p>[Nordic countries
Affluent and wealthy. Strong social cohesion, relative equality, high standard of living, generous healthcare and welfare. Model society in the world. High level of trust in the country. Norway is the largest oil producer in Scandinavia, Sweden is a technologically advanced country with a growing number of engineering companies and service exports. Along with Canada, it is the world’s largest music exporter. Denmark is the happiest country in the world with high income from oil, gas, and food production. The outlook is bright.</p>
<p>[Russia
Largest in the world, with vast natural resources including oil, gas, minerals, and rare earths; demand for these resources is not likely to be low. It has excellent human capital, a high level of education, and an entrepreneurial spirit; it has land borders with the EU and China; and it has a large population of about 100 million people by 2050, of whom about 100 million will be living in the country by 2050. On the other hand, demographics are problematic: the population is projected to decline from 143 million to 116 million by 2050. Laws and regulations are not stable, making it difficult for foreign capital to invest. The country is highly dependent on energy and raw material exports and has no other way to generate wealth. The position is sinking fast.</p>
<p>[China
Needless to say, the economic growth was terrible. China is covered so much in this book that I can’t write about it here, on the contrary, I’ll make a note of it when I have room.</p>
<p>[Japan</p>
<p>The biggest challenge is dealing with aging. We are entering an area that no other country in the world has experienced, and in some ways it is the frontier. We have experienced a roller coaster ride of rapid change in the past half century. We have had the fastest economic growth in the world, becoming the second largest economy in the world, but in 2018 we are much poorer than the citizens of the United States. It has turned inward and put the lives of its citizens first. Sony, Toshiba, Panasonic, and others have lost the dominance they had 20 years ago.</p>
<p>The world has much to learn from Japan. It has the lowest crime rate in the world and the longest life expectancy in the world. They have a relationship of support and help each other to solve problems efficiently, the quality of their services is high, their cities are clean, and they have built a society that is unmatched in the world.</p>
<p>Japan has the world’s most aged population, but it is coping really well with demographic changes. Social cohesion is strong, cooperation is high, and families are cherished.</p>
<hr/>
<p>1/4 of the Japanese workforce will be over 75 years old by 2045. In this case, what will Japan’s standard of living be? Productivity is clearly declining, with the lowest output per worker among the G7 countries. It will be quite difficult to increase productivity, although outdated business practices are a major cause.</p>
<p>Now, while life is calm, orderly, clean, crime is low, and citizens are comfortable, it is no longer the innovation-producing society it was in the 1980s, and it is unlikely to regain its dynamism. The economy has barely grown since the 1990s and will continue to do so for a long time.</p>
<p>This would change if there were a large influx of foreign visitors, but the Japanese seem to refuse to accept it.</p>
<p>An aging society can function smoothly if young people are prepared to accept the fact that the standard of living will decline as the birthrate declines and the population ages.</p>
<p>The more other countries are disrupted by immigration in the future, the more they will be convinced that “it was a good thing we closed our borders and didn’t let in too many foreign workers!” I am likely to become more and more convinced that this is a good thing. The spirit of helping each other in times of need has been the glue that holds Japanese society together, and this kind of social contract will remain.</p>
<hr/>
<p>In short… Japan continues to be Japan. Japan will become more Japanese, more alien to the rest of the world, more disconnected from the world’s way of thinking, and more likely to develop the feeling that “the current society is right for the Japanese! and this is likely to deepen the feeling that “the current society is right for the Japanese people!</p>
<p>Turn inward, not outward looking to the outside world.</p>
<p>Despite its relatively smaller economy, even in 2050, Japan will remain the world’s fourth largest economy. Its alliance with the U.S. is unshakable. Japan will continue to be a highly capable manufacturing powerhouse. Japanese culture will continue to have a strong influence on other countries. Japan will continue to be a role model for an aging society.</p>
<hr/>
<p>There is a reality that we have to face.</p>
<p>One is the structure of the economy. Can we maintain our position as technology leader? Today’s high technology is built on skills developed a generation ago; we will continue to be a world power in 2050, but we are likely to move away from the world’s leading edge in most areas of the economy.</p>
<p>The other is the fiscal situation. The ratio of public debt to GDP is the highest among the world’s major economies and continues to rise. This situation is unsustainable. Somewhere in the next 30 years, the debt will need to be restructured. We do not know what form default will take, but it may be triggered by developments outside the country, for example, rising global interest rates. The labor force is shrinking rapidly and this public debt level is unsustainable, right?</p>
<p>Geopolitics is also a concern. We cannot be a force against China. It will defend its own territory, but will not join the shield of China’s territorial expansion.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Japan will remain a cohesive and stable society in 2050, but will no longer be concerned about the world. Supporting the people will become Japan’s priority. Low crime, cleanliness, and respect for order.</p>

I think it’s pretty interesting. The change is too flashy.</p>
