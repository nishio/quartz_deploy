<p>Suppressing pages that have already appeared should be limited to those appearing in vector searches.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you happen to pull something at random, but it seems relevant, you should again do a vector search on that content and use the most relevant part, so</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="./AI-Reading-Notebook" class="internal alias" data-slug="AI-Reading-Notebook">AI Reading Notebook</a> is working for now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No vector search.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m running it on GPT-3.5, and it’s only up to 4K.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the 16K version or</li>
<li>Then, on the other hand, it’s like, “Well, we’ve got a lot of space, so let’s put more information in.</li>
<li>But then the ratio of “what you read” to “what you write” would increase, and you might find yourself disappearing more and more!
<ul>
<li>Maybe it will.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the end, what matters is the amount of your output.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh, I thought I was using 3.5, but it was 4.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Assuming IO to Scrapbox, there’s only one input/output port and error messages come to the same place, but with that mechanism, if I loop it mechanically, I’ll read the error message and write the rest.</p>
<p>Oh, with 3.5, I sometimes translate what I read and write it down as I read it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Once you do that, you look at it and do the next one, so it’s like a translation, not a note.</li>
</ul>
<p>Rough estimate, it costs about $0.48 per step, and each book is going to take about 100-500 steps, so, well, that’s a pretty expensive mess.</p>
<p>The fill_with_related_fragments system is now returning a string that fills the given token and a list of the titles of the pages used, but this should change.</p>
<ul>
<li>Because now it’s got that “stack the relevant stuff and random chunks for the rest” behavior.</li>
<li>In this implementation, I want to pass half of the frame and pour the text data into the remainder and the other half.</li>
<li>That kind of flexibility in the current design is not good.
<ul>
<li>There’s a whole bunch of code that shouldn’t be tightly coupled because it’s tied to the interface in the beginning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I forgot to push again today and the code for periodic execution is a bit old…</p>
<ul>
<li>push and manual trigger, or</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s add lots of heads with multi-heads.</p>
<ul>
<li>Generating a story about what to read on your phone on the train ride home from camp.</li>
<li>Changed cron to once an hour.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s see if we can make it by the time we take off.</p>
<ul>
<li>Perspective of ✅ title</li>
<li>✅ Pile on the NG list of vector searches.</li>
<li>Increase the percentage of ✅vector searches
<ul>
<li>OK for now, since “up to 3” has been changed to “3”.</li>
<li>I would like to do some initial, balancing in the future in case of low input.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Distinguish between titles picked up at random and those picked up in a vector search.</li>
</ul>
<p>leaving (fleeing) the venue</p>
<ul>
<li>I made a lot of parallel notes for now.</li>
<li>I’ll have to remember to stop this one tonight…
<ul>
<li>It runs once an hour, so it’s going to be tough tomorrow morning.</li>
<li>The theory that we are already in a lot of trouble even now.</li>
<li>TODO Back to once a day when you get home.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Good to run many themes in parallel.
<ul>
<li>If you remove the 🔁 mark, the auto-renewal will stop.</li>
<li>But I’m thinking that explicitly cutting the mark is not a very good experience.</li>
<li>Wouldn’t it be nice if the frequency slowly decreased?
<ul>
<li><a href="./Spaced-Repetition" class="internal alias" data-slug="Spaced-Repetition">Spaced Repetition</a></li>
<li>Gradual increase in span.</li>
<li>If a human reacts, it goes back to day one.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Generation date and time are indicated.
<ul>
<li>If the update date is later than the generation date, it means that the edit was made, so it will be updated at the next regular timing.</li>
<li>If not updated, updated only if the “difference between the last generation and the previous generation” multiplied by 1.5 is exceeded
<ul>
<li>So it would be 1,2,3,5,8,13, and so on.</li>
<li>Almost <a href="./Fibonacci-series" class="internal alias" data-slug="Fibonacci-series">Fibonacci series</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When an error occurs, all the fragments are output, so I have to delete them, very tedious to do from my phone.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you didn’t turn it off, you should still get an error the next time the context width is over, which is a bad implementation w</li>
</ul>
<p>I just counted and you have 20 pages of parallel topics, you are making too much!</p>
<ul>
<li>Some of them are keywords that I learned today from listening to the LT of the Lab Youth people.</li>
<li>Some of these keywords have been mentioned for years.
<ul>
<li>GPT4 can also be answered since it is a general keyword</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some are keywords such as Kozaneba so raw GPT4 is not answered
<ul>
<li>So far you’ve answered well, picking up information from Scrapbox.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I get a release notification from Github at 16:07, but 20 GPT4s run after this, huh? Then an overwrite runs in about 30 minutes? Hard to write…</p>
<ul>
<li>I still think we should move during sleeping hours.</li>
</ul>
<p>16:58 I thought maybe an update would come while I was lost at Yokohama station, but it didn’t.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is this down to some kind of error?</li>
<li>It hasn’t even fallen off!
<ul>
<li><img src="https://gyazo.com/ab7d0180a5019f3dce73d8847244610d/thumb/1000" alt="image"/></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I think you may have committed with pdb.set_trace on without looking at it carefully again.
<ul>
<li>Doesn’t sound like it.</li>
<li>I’ll have to look at the logs to be sure.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Or work tethered from home on the next transfer.
<ul>
<li>I don’t know if such a place exists.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Stopped the action running.</li>
<li>I thought I changed the schedule and forgot to push again…
<ul>
<li>I got an email notification that it was released.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Debugging, mystery solved.</p>
<ul>
<li>Embedded API failure retries endlessly</li>
<li>So why do they fail?</li>
<li>Previous Note” is an empty string.</li>
<li>How did that happen?</li>
<li>A case where the GPT4 API failed and the error log was written as a previous note, and I didn’t want it to be read as a note, so when I deleted it from my phone, it left a blank line</li>
</ul>
<p>Hmmm, what to do.</p>
<ul>
<li>A: Fundamentally, it is not good that the error log can be read as a note</li>
<li>B: When there is only a blank line above the marker, it is strange to make a blank line the previous note, which can be caused by inadvertent mistakes in the future.</li>
<li>C: It is strange to do a vector search when the previous note is really empty in the first place
<ul>
<li>The original design was randomly filled in, but we decided to ignore that use case.</li>
<li>Even if it is empty, the title exists, so use it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>D: It is strange that the embedded API retries infinitely when an empty string is really passed to it
<ul>
<li>Immediately throws an exception because it is strange that an empty string is passed in the first place.
