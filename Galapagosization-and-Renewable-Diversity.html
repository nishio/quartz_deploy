<p>Galapagosization (Galapagos-ka)</p>
<p>problem
Loss of international competitiveness: Technology or products developed only in Japan may lose competitiveness in global markets because they differ from international standards. For example, unique Japanese cell phone features may be unnecessary or unsupported overseas.
High cost: Developing products for a specific market can cause R&amp;D costs to increase, ultimately leading to products that are more expensive for consumers.
Technology isolation: fewer opportunities for technological collaboration and joint development with other countries, which can delay the introduction of the latest technologies.
advantage
Market-driven products: Products specifically tailored to the Japanese market are designed to meet the unique needs of Japanese consumers, resulting in very high customer satisfaction.
Fostering innovation: The unique market environment encourages the development of new ideas and technologies, sometimes resulting in creative solutions that can serve as the basis for expansion into international markets.
Reflection of cultural characteristics: Products may contribute to the reinforcement of cultural identity because they reflect Japanese culture and values.</p>
<p>Galapagosized features
Foldable Design (Flip Phone): Foldable phones became all the rage in Japan in the 2000s. This is in contrast to the quick transition to smartphones in Western markets.
One-seg TV function: The one-seg TV function, which allows users to receive TV broadcasts, is a service unique to Japan and has rarely been adopted in other countries.
Osaifu-Keitai: A system that uses NFC-like technology to allow users to pay for public transportation and make purchases in stores using their cell phones. While widely used in Japan, different systems are used in other countries.
Deco-mail: An e-mail function using pictograms and decorative text that became popular in Japan but did not spread internationally.
The term “Galaga
Galapagos cell phone” is an abbreviation for “Galapagos cell phone,” which refers to a conventional cell phone with features and styles unique to Japan that differ from international standards. With the advent and spread of smartphones, traditional cell phones have come to be regarded as obsolete, and the term “Galapagos” has come to include the nuances of being old and inefficient. However, over the years, they have remained popular with many users due to their ease of use, robust construction, and long battery life.</p>
<p>The reason these characteristics are considered “Galapagosization” is that while these technologies and features have been very successful in Japan, different technologies have become mainstream in global markets, and this is one reason why Japanese cell phone manufacturers have struggled in international markets.</p>

<p>The birth and development of pictograms is closely linked to the evolution of digital communication. Pictograms have revolutionized international digital communication as a visual means of conveying emotion and intent in a concise manner.</p>
<p>birth
The origins of emoji go back to Japan in the 1990s, when Japanese engineer Shunsuke Kurita developed the first set of emoji in 1999 while working for NTT DoCoMo, a cell phone company. His goal was to make pagers and cell phone text messaging more attractive and emotionally expressive. The first set he created included 176 12x12 pixel icons representing weather, transportation, time of day, etc.</p>
<p>development
The use of pictograms quickly spread in Japan and eventually became popular around the world. In 2007, when Apple launched the iPhone, it made a major contribution to the spread of pictograms by supporting them for the Japanese market. Following Apple’s move, other OS developers began supporting pictograms, and pictograms became an international phenomenon.</p>
<p>Emoji Internationalization and Standardization
In 2010, pictograms were officially adopted as part of the Unicode standard, ensuring compatibility across different systems and platforms. With their inclusion in Unicode, pictograms continue to be further subdivided and icons added that reflect a wide variety of expressions and cultural characteristics.</p>
<p>The development of pictograms has cemented their status as the global language of digital communication and revolutionized the way people express feelings and ideas. Today, pictograms have become a universal language widely understood and used across cultures.</p>
<p>The term “Galapagos” usually refers to the Galapagos Islands, an Ecuadorian territory located on the Pacific coast of South America. The archipelago is famous for its unique ecosystems and diverse wildlife, and was the inspiration for Charles Darwin, the father of the theory of evolution, to construct an important part of his theory.</p>
<p>Geography and Biodiversity
The Galapagos Islands consist of numerous volcanic islands that are known for the evolution of unique life forms. These islands are home to a number of endemic species found nowhere else, which form the uniqueness of the archipelago’s biodiversity. Representative species include the Galapagos giant tortoise, the Galapagos finch (Darwin’s finch), and the marine iguana.</p>
<p>Cultural Meaning
In addition to being important from a scientific and ecological perspective, the term “Galapagos” is sometimes used metaphorically in other fields as well. For example, the term “Galapagosization” in Japan is used to refer to technologies and products that have developed independently in Japan and deviated from international standards. This is due to the fact that the organisms on the Galapagos Islands evolved independently in their isolated environment.</p>
<p>Protection and Challenges
The Galapagos Islands are now a World Natural Heritage site and are subject to strict environmental protection measures, but face new threats from expanding tourism, invasive alien species, and climate change. Addressing these challenges is essential for the sustainable protection of the archipelago and the maintenance of its biodiversity.</p>

<li><a href="./Bazaar-surrounded-by-private-clubs" class="internal alias" data-slug="Bazaar-surrounded-by-private-clubs">Bazaar surrounded by private clubs</a>
Richard Rorty’s quote “We can urge the construction of a world order whose model is a bazaar surrounded by lots and lots of exclusive private clubs.” while still having diversity, Rorty’s quote, “We can urge the construction of a world order whose model is a bazaar surrounded by lots and lots of exclusive private clubs. In this model, the general market (bazaar) is the site of extensive interaction, but surrounded by exclusive private clubs with individual characteristics.</li>
</ul>
<p>This idea can be considered in relation to the concept of “Galapagosization”. Galapagosization means that a particular culture or technology is isolated from outside influences and evolves on its own. This process is similar to the “exclusive private clubs” Rorty describes, where each club (or country or region) has its own rules and standards, but functions within a larger “bazaar” (global market).</p>
<p>For example, Galapagosization in the Japanese technology market, where products that are highly adapted domestically differ from international standards, can be compared to exclusive clubs of roti. These clubs (or markets) have their own characteristics, but exist and influence each other in relation to the broader market.</p>
<p>Thus, the model proposed by Rorty may help us better understand the challenges of Galapagosization as one way to simultaneously pursue independence and global integration. It suggests seeking ways to function within a larger economic and cultural framework while maintaining uniqueness.</p>

This paragraph emphasizes the importance of the fundamental yet ambitious goal of collaboration across diversity and then defines how that goal may be pursued in various domains. The framework mentioned here is for designs that navigate between the dangers of hasty optimization and chaotic experimentation. It also addresses the risks of tapping into the potential for collaboration across diversity and discusses the need to revitalize diversity to address the danger of diminishing diversity available for future collaboration.</p>
<p>Relation to Galapagosization
The concept of Galapagosization refers to the phenomenon of a particular technology or culture evolving independently and becoming isolated from outside elements in the process. Given the connection between this concept and the above paragraph, an important theme is how collaboration across diversity can work in a Galapagosized environment.</p>
<p>Emphasize the importance of diversity: While Galapagosization encourages unique evolution within a particular environment or community, cross-diversity collaboration seeks to generate new ideas and solutions through interaction with people from different backgrounds and perspectives. This avoids the risk of local optimization caused by Galapagosization and enables problem solving from a broader perspective.
Regenerate and retain diversity: Galapagosization protects certain characteristics and technologies while other options and possibilities are often lost. In the context of cross-diversity collaboration, it is necessary to regenerate this lost diversity and create new diversity for future collaboration. This decreases the risk of relying on a single solution and promotes sustainable innovation.
Applying the Framework: Applying a cross-diversity collaboration framework to a Galapagosized environment can strike a balance between premature optimization and chaotic experimentation. This allows for more innovative solutions that are not bound by fixed thinking or existing frameworks.
Thus, collaboration across diversity can be an effective strategy to overcome the phenomenon of Galapagosization and explore new possibilities beyond its limitations.</p>
