Each of these white dots is a piece of music, and the user is mapped into this space by the listening record.</p>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>It seems that a system like … helps people discover their favorite music from the 400,000 vocaloid songs posted on Nico Nico Nico.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kuchii/icon" alt="kuchii.icon" height="19.5"/>I understand that, but in the first place, Nishio, you are not interested in music, are you? Usually, people create a self-image of “I like this kind of music” in order to give themselves an identity without an identity, or they act like “I should listen to the songs everyone else is listening to 10 times” in order to fit in with society, but you don’t seem to be interested in such things.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>That is certainly true. Of course there is a possibility that after experiencing it for a while, you will say, “This is <a href="./not-for-me" class="internal alias" data-slug="not-for-me">not for me</a>,” but still, I don’t think it is good to say “I think it is not for me” and not experience it without experiencing it.</p>

<p>Kiite World for all songs

If you click on the picture icon, the song seems to play from the chorus.
The smallest I had to scroll hard to get around, but if I click on the icon, it’s a snap to get around.
I guess I should just keep clicking and moving around.</p>
<p><img src="https://gyazo.com/23c2f9c6b26d091d4b6e0a40f2fe9433/thumb/1000" alt="image"/>
I think I can go there by clicking at random, I’m not sure, so I’m just moving around and listening at random.
I tried liking it, I tried putting it on my playlist, but I couldn’t figure out how to find the “where was that song I just played?”
Is this a place to find something new in a once-in-a-lifetime kind of way?</p>
<p>I’ll try to get out of it for a while.

<li>It was fixed after a while, either I didn’t register enough or it needs to be a while since I made it.</li>

<p>I got to the song I was listening to earlier in “From Where I Was Last Time.”

<p>Funny how the same person’s music isn’t always on the side.</p>
<ul>
<li>I explored around this song and found a big “Aquarion of Genesis” cluster next to it.
<ul>
<li>I rather like it, but I’m exploring new things, so I’ll hold off on that.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m starting to verbalize a few things.</p>
<ul>
<li>We all have a “song direction we like,” but we don’t have the vocabulary to describe it.</li>
<li>And in the old days, people would say, “What is this kind of music called? Techno? House? What’s the difference?” and they ran into mismatches and ambiguities as they tried to express themselves with a limited vocabulary.
<ul>
<li>I associate it with “[You’re not capable of classifying you.
On the other hand, unlike the days of records and CDs, when the cost of acquiring music was high, now we can listen to a vast array of music and express our “liking” for it.
So, we live in an age where we can express our preferences and interact with each other as a vector of higher dimensions, without classifying ourselves into N discrete categories at the highest.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Normal people create a self-image of “I like this kind of music” to give themselves an identity without an identity, or act like “I should listen to the songs everyone else is listening to 10 times” to fit in with society, but you don’t seem to be interested in such things.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, as you point out, this doesn’t mean that I have any desire to make “myself liking these songs” my “primary identity,” but it does feel like I’ve discovered a characteristic vector that expresses me that I wasn’t aware of.</p>
<ul>
<li>At present, I have no desire to confirm whether the vectors in the social relationships I have already established match those of other people, but as social networking services in this new vector space develop, I see a future in which I can find “very like-minded people” whom I do not know their faces or names, and who may not even speak Japanese, and we can share “new songs I have explored and found” with each other in a relaxed and mutually enriching way. I think there is a future where we can enrich each other’s lives by sharing “new songs we found through our own search” with each other in a relaxed manner.
<ul>
<li>People do not need to have a single identity, but different identities are used in different community spaces. If this is the case, then if we create a <a href="./vector-identity" class="internal alias" data-slug="vector-identity">vector identity</a> through the power of algorithms, a <a href="./vector-space" class="internal alias" data-slug="vector-space">vector space</a> will be created there and a new <a href="./social-distance" class="internal alias" data-slug="social-distance">social distance</a> will be defined, and a new <a href="./geo-related-community" class="internal alias" data-slug="geo-related-community">geo-related community</a> will be created through proximity there.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As for “let’s listen to the song everyone else is listening to 10 times,” that kind of behavior is what focused <a href="./attention" class="internal" data-slug="attention">attention</a> on the top instead of the <a href="./long-tail" class="internal alias" data-slug="long-tail">long tail</a> in the first place.</p>
<ul>
<li>Positive feedback <a href="./what-gets-attention-gets-even-more-attention" class="internal alias" data-slug="what-gets-attention-gets-even-more-attention">what gets attention gets even more attention</a>.</li>
<li>As long as this mechanism is in place, even if you say, “Let’s focus on the long tail,” you’re looking at <a href="./the-top-of-the-clipped-tail" class="internal alias" data-slug="the-top-of-the-clipped-tail">the top of the clipped tail</a>.</li>
<li>By eliminating any “ranking by number of likes” or “ranking by number of list subscriptions,” we are preventing collapsing into the one-dimensional evaluation axis of ranking, and creating a world in which diverse values are maintained.</li>
