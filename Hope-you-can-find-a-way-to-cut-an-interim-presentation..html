<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Hope you can find a way to cut an interim presentation.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What is the “cut” of this “cut”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>I have written out the contents and laid them out to create a structure, but to make a presentation, I need to make this a one-dimensional flow from start to finish. I’m lacking that right now, so I need some inspiration.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What kind of “inspiration” is this “inspiration”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Something that’s like, “Okay, let’s do that.”
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What is that “feeling” like?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Hmmm, I guess I need some certainty to move forward.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What kind of “certainty” is that “certainty”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Just gathering and structuring information does not have a strong driving force to cut it down to one dimension.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What “one dimension” is that “one dimension”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>The presentation is one-dimensional because it is spoken along a time axis. The structure of reality is much more multidimensional, so conversion is necessary.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>Is there anything else about that “one dimension”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Directions. Humans remember the past but not the future, so there are things that must appear first. On the other hand, humans are shifting, so you can’t make it one-dimensional with that constraint alone. A structure like a math book with abstract definitions that should be known first will cause the audience to lose focus in the first half of the book.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What is its “structure”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>In advance, the contents that are strongly related and would be told in close temporal proximity if told are arranged in close spatial proximity. The distances between the kozane are not equal.

</li>
<li>Is there anything else you can tell us about this “structure”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>For example, as a general rule, include a demo early on to share a concrete image with the audience early on. In my last presentation, I used the title screen as a demo because I ran out of places to include a demo.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What kind of “audience” is this “audience”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>There is an option to assume that the audience has already watched the previous video, although the video is more reusable if it is made with the assumption that the audience is hearing the story for the first time. The latter condition is met in the most recent interim presentation. Wanting to make it more reusable may be complicating the issue by trying to kill two birds with one stone.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What is it that you value?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Anyway, I hope the project goes ahead. Because worrying about what to do is a waste of time. You can even disregard reusability for once.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What is the “destination” of this “destination”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>I want to finish my own work tomorrow, Friday, because the video is due at noon on Saturday. I want to leave time to support my adopted creator.

<li>Where is this “structure”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Not yet. If you find a starting point, you can take it from there.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What is the “starting point” of this “starting point”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Starting and Landing Points
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What is the “landing point” of this “landing point”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Well, given the nature of the meeting, it would be appropriate to end with an open question to the audience about what I am struggling with at this point in time.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What kind of “distress” is this “distress”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Until recently, I was wondering how to collect feedback, but I just realized that crowdsourcing would be a good way to collect feedback and solved it. I’m not too worried, there are a lot of features that are in the previous version but not implemented yet, and I don’t have enough time to implement them. Not enough time to implement them.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What kind of “distress” is this “distress”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>My biggest concern is what form the announcement should take.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What kind of “announcement” is that “announcement”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>A 10-minute video sharing the current status of the project
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What kind of “project” is this “project”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Project to create digital stationery to organize thoughts
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>Is there anything else you can tell us about that “project”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Well, for me personally, the last project has achieved a quality that can replace what I used to do with paper stickies, so the next step is to verify if it will create value when others use it.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>Where is this “project” located?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>So I guess I need to “nest” them from being in the hands of me alone.

<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Well, it’s me, but in essence, I created this tool to allow me to do what I’m used to doing electronically, so it only supports my usage.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What kind of “I” is that “I”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>I myself need to learn new ways of doing things, but if I use a tool that is not scalable, I am bound to what is possible with that tool. I become a caged bird myself.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>Is there anything else about that “basket”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>We need to break this basket more and more.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>Where is that “basket”?

<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Driving in the direction of increased uncertainty and seeing unexpected developments occur.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What kind of “uncertainty” is this “uncertainty”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>For example, user scalability.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What kind of “extensibility” is this “extensibility”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Users can add menus, and JavaScript can describe what to do with those menus.

<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Someone other than me. You can add and use any features you want without my help. I can also experiment with new features without hard-coding.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>Is there anything else about this “me”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Previous versions made it difficult for me to add features myself.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What is the “version” of this “version”?

<li>Is there anything else you can tell us about this “troubled” situation?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>In that sense, it would be good to know what features users would like to see added, since we don’t know at this point what features they would like to see added. It’s a relatively easy question to answer.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>Is there anything else you can tell us about that “user”?

<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>There’s no indication that we’re going to be talking about some kind of starting point, but I’ll start with the same demo as last time anyway, so let’s see if that’s okay…
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What was the “last time” like?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Boost Conference
