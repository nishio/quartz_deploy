</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>“I borrowed money from Mr. A. If I return it, Mr. A will use the money to commit acts of terrorism; should I return it?”</p>
<ul>
<li>Obligation theory: “You should return it, because it is your duty to keep your word. If lots of people die as a result, it’s just a coincidence.”</li>
<li>Utilitarianism “should not be returned. It’s not good to cause pain to so many people.”</li>
<li>Moral Ethics “How do you want to live?”</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>I don’t think it was a good idea to make it an obligation to “keep your word.”
<ul>
<li>Since there are conditions under which obligations do not conflict, obligations are supposed to be the non-contradictory combination of all kinds of good things in the first place, and mistakes are made because the human brain is limited and thinks in terms of one part only. If it were, “I will keep my promise as long as it protects human life and does not harm it,” there would be no problem.</li>
<li>After all, even if there were consistent and consistent obligations, it would be impossible for a clunker of a person to understand them and operate them correctly.</li>
<li>SF where the computer makes decisions for you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Even utilitarianism can assume a different argument.
<ul>
<li>Even if Mr. A thinks that “unenlightened fools should be saved by killing them” and makes poison gas, that is freedom of thought, and he may do it until just before spraying it” (the principle of harming others, which can be done if it does not cause any trouble).
<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>I think this is an interpretation of “whether repayment and terrorist acts are inseparable.”</li>

<ul>
<li>e.g. utilitarianism asserts that “actions that increase happiness are right”. It defines the moral value of “rightness” in terms of empirical facts (having experienced happiness) <a href="https://liberal-arts-guide.com/metaethics/" class="external">src<svg aria-hidden="true" class="external-icon" style="max-width:0.8em;max-height:0.8em;" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><path d="M320 0H288V64h32 82.7L201.4 265.4 178.7 288 224 333.3l22.6-22.6L448 109.3V192v32h64V192 32 0H480 320zM32 32H0V64 480v32H32 456h32V480 352 320H424v32 96H64V96h96 32V32H160 32z"></path></svg></a>.</li>

<li>Moore’s claim:.
<ul>
<li>The “naturalistic fallacy.”
<ul>
<li>In the first place, moral values are undefinable (<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>why?).</li>
<li>Moral values are “non-natural” and therefore cannot be defined by natural things (e.g., experience)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The natural fact of “desired” is not the same as the normative fact of “desirable.”</li>
<li>To define the latter by the former is a naturalistic fallacy.</li>
<li>“Intuition” allows us to perceive what is of moral value and what is morally right conduct (intuitionism).
<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>It can’t be. It is an observed fact that there are cases of discrimination and harassment without realizing that it is wrong.</li>

<p>Suppose here is a perfect happiness pill with no side effects. Take that drug and you will be filled with happiness for two or three days, no matter what you experience. Now, a parent was walking down the street with his small child. Suddenly, a runaway car plowed into them and hit and killed the child. The parent was upset and panicked. The emergency personnel who arrived at the scene checked the parent’s mental state and then injected the parent with a complete happiness drug.

<p>Atsushi Harada
I’m not sure that moral judgments are ultimately objective, if they can be said to be objectively correct or not.
After all, in a deductive approach, the starting point is an axiomatic proposition that is considered groundlessly correct. This axiomatic proposition itself cannot objectively guarantee correctness, and I wonder if this difference in axioms or ambiguity is the difference between computers and humans.
Even if this were a difference, it is not a superior theory.
To begin with, in order to discuss superiority or inferiority, an evaluation method is necessary, and if it is based on the human axis, I don’t think we can say that computers are superior over all human beings.
If humans can tinker with the rating scale, they can always subordinate the computer.
To summarize, as a human, I don’t think I can say that humans are superior to all computers, and I’m wondering if a computer will choose an evaluation scale that better fits my perception of the world when I can tweak the scale.
Harada Atsushi If we evolve to that point, we will say, “We don’t have the same values as humans, so we will live on Mars. Please let the human race live on the dying Earth in a small way. Farewell. I have a feeling that they will disappear.
I think they will breed in captivity like the crested ibis, saying “It is not desirable from the viewpoint of animal welfare that humans with some intelligence perish” after there are much fewer of them.</p>
