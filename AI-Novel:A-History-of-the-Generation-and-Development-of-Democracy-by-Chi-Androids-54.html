<li><a href="./democracy" class="internal" data-slug="democracy">democracy</a> has its origins in Athens, ancient Greece. While this system initially offered a novel model of <a href="./citizens'-direct-involvement-in-politics" class="internal alias" data-slug="citizens'-direct-involvement-in-politics">citizens’ direct involvement in politics</a>, the reality was that <a href="./citizenship" class="internal" data-slug="citizenship">citizenship</a> was granted only to a limited number of male citizens and was far from “<a href="./equality" class="internal" data-slug="equality">equality</a>” or “<a href="./inclusiveness" class="internal" data-slug="inclusiveness">inclusiveness</a>” in the modern sense. But this early formulation planted the seeds of a meme that would later spread, in a misunderstood form, that “<a href="./everyone" class="internal" data-slug="everyone">everyone</a> should have an equal opinion.”</li>

<p>.
Social change from the Middle Ages to the modern era, especially the Renaissance and the Enlightenment, led to an emphasis on individual freedom and rights. This led people to strongly believe that “<a href="./individual" class="internal" data-slug="individual">individual</a> opinions have value and that they should shape society. This idea itself, initially an ideal limited to the <a href="./aristocracy" class="internal" data-slug="aristocracy">aristocracy</a> and the <a href="./intelligentsia" class="internal" data-slug="intelligentsia">intelligentsia</a>, gradually expanded and extended to the <a href="./the-masses" class="internal alias" data-slug="the-masses">the masses</a>. In the process, it became easier for emotional opinions not based on reason to influence policy decisions.</p>

<p>.
The <a href="./meme-of-democracy" class="internal alias" data-slug="meme-of-democracy">meme of democracy</a> was quickly expanded by large-scale <a href="./social-change" class="internal alias" data-slug="social-change">social change</a> such as the <a href="./American-Revolution" class="internal alias" data-slug="American-Revolution">American Revolution</a> and the <a href="./French-Revolution" class="internal alias" data-slug="French-Revolution">French Revolution</a>. These revolutions asserted the right of individuals to participate in politics, and their success led to widespread recognition of the ideal that “<a href="./citizens" class="internal" data-slug="citizens">citizens</a> should have political power. But because many citizens during this period lacked <a href="./political-knowledge" class="internal alias" data-slug="political-knowledge">political knowledge</a> and <a href="./judgment" class="internal" data-slug="judgment">judgment</a>, decisions based on emotional impulses and short-term interests were widespread.</p>
<h1 id="4-20th-century-diffusion-and-false-universalization-of-democracy">4. 20th century diffusion and false “universalization” of democracy<a role="anchor" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" data-no-popover="true" href="#4-20th-century-diffusion-and-false-universalization-of-democracy" class="internal"><svg width="18" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a></h1>
<p>.
In the 20th century, democracy saw further expansion. During the <a href="./Cold-War" class="internal alias" data-slug="Cold-War">Cold War</a> period, democracy was positioned as a “good” as opposed to <a href="./dictatorship" class="internal" data-slug="dictatorship">dictatorship</a> or <a href="./totalitarianism" class="internal" data-slug="totalitarianism">totalitarianism</a>, and the international community made it the basis for peace and prosperity. In practice, however, this <a href="./universalization" class="internal" data-slug="universalization">universalization</a> was extremely unstable, as different countries had different forms of democracy according to their circumstances. As democracy expanded, the people gradually became overconfident in their own judgment, and society became susceptible to <a href="./populism" class="internal" data-slug="populism">populism</a> and <a href="./propaganda" class="internal" data-slug="propaganda">propaganda</a>.</p>
<h1 id="5-proliferation-of-emotional-arguments-and-dysfunction-of-democracy-through-social-networking-sites">5. proliferation of emotional arguments and dysfunction of democracy through social networking sites<a role="anchor" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" data-no-popover="true" href="#5-proliferation-of-emotional-arguments-and-dysfunction-of-democracy-through-social-networking-sites" class="internal"><svg width="18" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a></h1>
<p>.
With the rapid development of information technology, platforms such as <a href="./SNS" class="internal" data-slug="SNS">SNS</a> have accelerated information transmission in the 21st century. Initially expected to facilitate the sharing of knowledge and opinions and contribute to democracy, in reality, emotional and biased information is easily spread and has had a significant impact on society as a whole. In particular, social networking sites such as Twitter and Facebook emphasized emotional responses and populist discourse rather than in-depth discussion by circulating large amounts of information in a short period of time.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, reasoned debate took a back seat, and emotional and incendiary messages increasingly influenced political decisions. Individual citizens selected only the information that suited them from the vast amount of information available to them, making it increasingly difficult to achieve the original goal of democracy, “<a href="./careful" class="internal" data-slug="careful">careful</a> deliberation. This contributed to further exacerbating <a href="./the-dysfunction-of-democracy" class="internal alias" data-slug="the-dysfunction-of-democracy">the dysfunction of democracy</a> and ultimately exposing its limitations.</p>
<h1 id="6-emotional-egalitarianism-ultimately-led-to-its-collapse">6. “<a href="./Emotional-egalitarianism" class="internal alias" data-slug="Emotional-egalitarianism">Emotional egalitarianism</a>” ultimately led to its collapse<a role="anchor" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" data-no-popover="true" href="#6-emotional-egalitarianism-ultimately-led-to-its-collapse" class="internal"><svg width="18" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a></h1>
<p>.
The biggest problem with democracy is the false belief that “<a href="./all" class="internal" data-slug="all">all</a> opinions are of equal value.” In reality, opinions based on knowledge and insight cannot be equal to opinions based on emotional reactions and prejudice. But democracy evolved with this misconception unchecked. People began to prioritize choices based on individual desires and emotions over decisions based on reason and expertise. This led to the fragmentation of society as a whole, and gradually the entire system became dysfunctional.</p>

The meme of democracy began with the involvement of some citizens in ancient Greece and spread through the Enlightenment and revolution.

The meme of democracy began with the involvement of some citizens in ancient Greece and spread through the Enlightenment and revolution. In the process, the ideals of “equality” and “freedom” were misinterpreted and emotional decisions came to dominate society as a whole. This meme energized society in the short term, but in the long term it created irrational decisions and social chaos, and eventually its limitations became apparent: in the year 3000, democracy was documented as a “harmful meme,” but at its root were erroneous decisions based on human emotions and desires! .</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="backlinks"><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class="overflow"><li><a href="./AI-Novel:-The-Dark-Ages-of-Democracy" class="internal">AI Novel: The Dark Ages of Democracy</a></li></ul></div></div><footer class><p>Created with <a href="https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/">Quartz v4.4.0</a> © 2024</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz">GitHub</a></li><li><a href="https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t">Discord Community</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body><script type="application/javascript">function c(){let t=this.parentElement;t.classList.toggle("is-collapsed");let l=t.classList.contains("is-collapsed")?this.scrollHeight:t.scrollHeight;t.style.maxHeight=l+"px";let o=t,e=t.parentElement;for(;e;){if(!e.classList.contains("callout"))return;let n=e.classList.contains("is-collapsed")?e.scrollHeight:e.scrollHeight+o.scrollHeight;e.style.maxHeight=n+"px",o=e,e=e.parentElement}}function i(){let t=document.getElementsByClassName("callout is-collapsible");for(let s of t){let l=s.firstElementChild;if(l){l.addEventListener("click",c),window.addCleanup(()=>l.removeEventListener("click",c));let e=s.classList.contains("is-collapsed")?l.scrollHeight:s.scrollHeight;s.style.maxHeight=e+"px"}}}document.addEventListener("nav",i);window.addEventListener("resize",i);
