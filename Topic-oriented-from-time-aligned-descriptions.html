The “Experiential Processes and the Creation of Meaning” Study Group 2 and the “Nodes of Thought 2023-08-10-2” fragment describe the conflict between time-aligned and topic-oriented descriptions and their ideal integration. This is related to the theme of the note, which is the transition from time-aligned descriptions to topic orientation. The Kozaneba:neri fragments are proposed as a tool to help Kozaneba address this issue. These fragments represent a new approach to resolving the conflict between time-based and topic-oriented.</p>

<p>The conflict between time-based and topic-oriented perspectives has a profound impact on the way information is organized and interpreted.

<pre><code>### &quot;Experiential Processes and the Creation of Meaning&quot; Study Session 2
　　　　I thought about why I did it and found that I chose one of several schemes.
　　　One community on Scrapbox describes this as [/villagepump/time-oriented] v.s. [/villagepump/context-oriented]or[/sta/topic-oriented
　　　　There is an opposition between the &quot;felt meaning&quot; pointed to by the symbol &quot;theme, context, topic&quot; and the &quot;felt meaning&quot; pointed to by the symbol &quot;time frame.&quot;
　　　Perhaps the ideal groupware should not only allow discussions to be stored and searched over time, but also facilitate organization by topic
　　　　Scrapbox &quot;can do both&quot; by making every page editable by anyone
　　　　　Add to that the author's philosophy that it should not be &quot;[a] warehouse of dead texts&quot; and that simply storing chat logs is using them as a warehouse of dead texts, and it only encourages organization by topic among those who share that philosophy.
　　　　　It's not a constraint as a system, so I'm sure in many cases if you introduce it into a random organization, it would become a minute book repository.
　　Q: Mailing lists can also be viewed in time or in a tree.
　　 A: But it's hard to use a topic that was spoken about in another tree


### node of thought 2023-08-10-2

Q: Is it ideal to be able to move freely between temporal and contextual schemes?
　A: I think it would be ideal for me to be able to come and go.
　When I'm organizing, I want to organize on the topic axis, but when I don't understand a fragment by itself, I want to shuffle around and see the time line where it came from, and then I see, and then I want to go back to the topic axis and organize again.
　I have been thinking that it would be nice if Kozaneba had such a function, but now &quot;position&quot; is a two-dimensional vector, which is just a higher dimensional vector mapped to two dimensions, with a time axis behind it. But that's ok.

Q: Essentially what we need is a dependency of information, and I think temporal relationships are a substitute for that
　A: When expressed as a sentence, dependencies naturally tend to be in close proximity in a sentence
　So when you read it, you need to read it once you have preserved the information about the time frame, and then afterwards you need to read it and wonder what the structure would have been like in the author's mind.

 [KJ Method Study Session Reflection Study Session] 
[nishio.icon]I didn't realize how important it was to &quot;draw the line&quot; when I created Kozaneba.


### Kozaneba:Neri Neri
[* human speech and writing]
	Human speech and writing are believed to unfold in a one-dimensional time series. This linear structure fragments information and may require breaking the structure when exploring specific topics or thematics.

[* Topic and time series].
	The conflict between topic-oriented and time-series, or time-oriented, is highlighted. It is suggested that the structure of time series may have to be destroyed in order to create a new topic-oriented structure. This may pose a challenge in organizing and interpreting information.

[* Spaced Repetition]
	This concept is related to learning and refers to a method of repeatedly reviewing information at regular intervals. This time-based approach is said to have &quot;gradual value&quot;. Perhaps it helps to connect information that is scattered over time and deepens understanding.

[* associative search].
	The expression &quot;2,000 dimensions&quot; could refer to a high-dimensional search and analysis to relate information in multiple dimensions. A multidimensional analysis would help to capture a richer view of the structure and relevance of information.

[* Kozaneba]
	Following the preceding discussion, the properties of Kozaneba are mentioned again, emphasizing the organization of information in a two-dimensional space and the representation of associations by drawing lines. And this approach is said to reduce the &quot;pain of destruction.


### Organize in reverse chronological order
Organize in reverse chronological order
For example, in a dialogue between two people, as the dialogue progresses, things that have not been verbalized are verbalized, knowledge on both sides increases, and new insights are gained, so the later the richer the description of the world should be!

Chat logs and minutes in chronological order are good for reliving the passage of time in the process.
But it's not about &quot;[Bring the important stuff first.
　Bringing important things first is a useful guideline for organizing information for re-reading
　People usually read from top to bottom, so if you put the important stuff at the top, you can adjust the time it takes to read according to demand, such as &quot;I want to know roughly the important parts&quot; or &quot;I want to know every detail.
　　In other words, &quot;[Just read as far as you want and stop.

What would happen, for example, if [Kozaneba] were to place them in reverse chronological order, starting with the newest statement?

impressions
　Kozaneba sorted out some of the words that were not mine, which were split into multiple posts.
　I didn't see a strong advantage to organizing in reverse order to the time line.
　　What I thought was &quot;important&quot; after organizing on Kozaneba does not match the &quot;last post&quot; before organizing.
　　　As I was sorting through it, I kept coming up with new insights.

### Read in the direction of execution time
Read in the direction of execution time
>What would reading in the run time direction equate to in a book? I do not have the answer.
 [The Intellectual Production of Engineers]  p.125  [(Column) Time Direction Reading] 

I thought it was to observe how the author, or someone who fully understands the contents of the book, behaves in his/her daily life.

As for reading in the direction of creation time, when one person writes several books (or articles or lectures), I imagined reading them in order from the oldest to the newest. However, this is more like &quot;reading the person&quot; than &quot;reading the books.
It would be nice to have a commit log of the book writing process, but many authors don't make it available, and the Stream on Scrapbox is very detailed, but now it's too hard for the reader.

More specifics.
	Timeline 1: A person who left one of the largest companies, X, claims that he was on the fastest track to success.
	Timeline 2: My friend who recently received an unprecedented promotion responds, &quot;No, no, you're running on existing rails and you say you're the fastest, but to someone who doesn't run on rails, it's like we're all on different sides of the same coin.
	Timeline 3: After some time has passed, I read an anonymous testimonial about a 360-degree evaluation being done at a large company, Y, that was not very good.
	Timeline 4: I think that superiority in that evaluation method is just a matter of who is ahead on the rails in big company Y, and most people in the world aren't on those rails.
	Time Series 5: Recalling the events of Time Series 2

	I think &quot;tactics ←→strategy&quot; is too abstract.

### Try Thinking Fireworks
　I see, so this is how you promote multifaceted thinking around a theme.

　I'd like to fill in the subtle gap on the left.

[https://gyazo.com/05dbe5875a33d29fc79b15b273def32c]
　Oh, I'm connected.
　Next, we're going to fix this and island it 2-5 sheets at a time.
　Or take a screenshot and write it down on your iPad.

Oh shit, it's too small.
I took more screenshots and shrunk them down.

Sounds good, let's make this into a narrative tomorrow.
　The flow that was created is counterclockwise, but I think I'll go clockwise when I make the narrative, because it fits better.

About 2 hours so far.

### Gradual iterations of a story are difficult to split up.
Slowly devolving stories are hard to divide.
When ideas develop on a time scale, they get lost in a one-dimensional output.
If you try to connect the end and the tip of a story after you've written it, they're too far apart to connect.
The lack of connection reveals &quot;not one topic&quot;.
But each line is so densely interconnected that you can't even separate them.
