*1305465673* I bought a MacBook Air.
Reprinted from Twitter:.
>>
MacBook hard drive is ticking and crying...
&lt;&lt;

>>
I rebooted my MacBook and the ticking noise from the hard drive wouldn't stop and it said it couldn't find the startup drive, so I stubbed out the front right corner and it started up!
&lt;&lt;

>>
Backup is complete. But the hard disk is ticking and the battery is swollen, so I've been using it with two disposable chopsticks underneath for a while now. I think I should buy a new machine. I'll probably use a MacBook Air since it's a portable machine...
&lt;&lt;

>>
tgbt: that should be replaced. I'm scared > battery pregnancy
&lt;&lt;

>>
dnobori: I've had my MacBook Air for just over a month and it's pretty good
&lt;&lt;

So I went to the AppleStore in Ginza and bought a MacBook Air! At first, I was thinking of getting a 128GB disk with 4GB memory, but they didn't have 128GB disk with 4G memory in stock, so I had to decide whether to add 30,000 yen and get 256GB disk with 4G memory or 128GB disk with 2G memory. I had to decide whether to buy the more expensive one or the cheaper one in such a situation. That's the price after deducting the 5334 yen discount for the academic pack.

>>
When I get back, I'll measure the time it takes to restore from a backup and then compare the times for various processes!
&lt;&lt;

>>
I chose to restore from time capsule and after about 5 minutes of calculating the size, I discovered that I was 5.8GB short... 4.6GB of downloads and 24.2GB of documents for now... I'll do the movies and music later. I'll put them off for now, since they look good.
&lt;&lt;

The original HDD used 130GB, and the MBA's capacity is 128.... However, 20GB of movies and music, which are supposed to be movies and voice memos taken with iPhone, are absurd, so I decided to remove them and restore them for the time being. It was easy because I just unchecked the boxes while looking at the size.

>>
It has been 7 minutes since the transfer started and it shows 33 minutes left.
&lt;&lt;

>>
It took them about 20 minutes to finish the transfer and then they said it would take 55 minutes to transfer the documents. I thought that was the whole time. Then 10 minutes later, it said there was still an hour to go.... Maybe I didn't need to transfer the documents now. I probably have all the PDFs and stuff I made with the ScanSnap.
&lt;&lt;

>>
I was going to compare the speed of various processes between the old MacBook and MacBookAir since it took 1 hour and 22 minutes to restore from the backup, but since mdworker of spotlight was running and taking most of the CPU, I decided to wait for another time.
&lt;&lt;

But it was over in less than an hour, because of the SSD?

I'll try it right away.

First, Firefox; with QuickSilver ready to launch when you press Enter, press Enter and the stopwatch at the same time, and measure the time it takes for the white window to open. It took 11.2 seconds on the old MacBook and 3.4 seconds on the MBA, or 3 to 4 times longer.

What other apps take a long time to start up? 16.6sec vs 3.1sec for XCode, 27.3sec vs 7.3sec for Photoshop Element...hmmm...I guess these apps that take a long time to start up are usually 3 to 4 times faster.

I tried to install iWork, and since my MBA does not have a disk drive, I tried to &quot;network share&quot; the drive on the machine next to me. I clicked on &quot;Remote Disk&quot; in the Finder. Then I saw a button in the upper left corner of the screen that says &quot;Ask to borrow&quot;. Pressing this button brings up a dialog on the machine that has the drive, and if you choose to accept it, you can use it. And it worked just as easily as if the drive was on my machine. Hmmm.

Oh, it's fully charged, so I unplugged the power and it says something about 11 hours left!

&lt;img src=&quot;http://gyazo.com/58153646bee82a0d9bab7c684761861a.png&quot;>

But it soon dropped to about 9.5 hours. Well, it was still more than enough.

GoogleIME was not restored for some reason, so I installed it. I wonder if it is positioned as not an application. But it remembers all the words I registered. The bookmarks, history, and various settings of the browser are the same as those of the machine I was using until yesterday, so I can easily transfer to the new machine.

By the way, the machine I used until yesterday had a JIS keyboard, but I took this opportunity to change it to a US keyboard, so I sometimes get backslashes when I try to type a new line, and the modifier position has changed so much that I can't type without trying.

&lt;hr>
I delete files that I don't seem to need to save disk size. it's rather obvious that Documents is large, and in it I found Steam content and the data I downloaded when I put Wikipedia on my iPhone. I'm not sure if Windows allows you to use the license key for anything else unless you do an abbreviated activation, I'm not sure. I'll put this one on hold.

Now that I have a lot of space left, let's restore the videos and music I didn't restore earlier by connecting the external hard drive I use to TimeMachine...so what am I going to do? Actually, I have never restored from TimeMachine normally. I'm told to back up regularly, so I just connect the hard drive and do a &quot;backup now&quot;. Oh, you can go back in time on this? I can look at the file tree with the state I backed up yesterday. I look in the video section and see that it's just about 8GB of my processed video material, so I don't need to put it back here. But the music file has my iTunes library in it, so I don't want to put it back. There are some songs in there that I don't want. Well, I'll just restore it all and then delete it when I feel like it.

Then it asked me &quot;where do you want to restore it to?&quot;, perhaps because the Music folder was not empty, and I mishandled the operation and created ~/Music/iTunes/Music. $ mv ~/Music/iTunes/Music/iTunes/* ~/Music/iTunes/

You can also change CapsLock to Ctrl by clicking the &quot;Modifier Keys&quot; button in the keyboard section of the System Preferences without installing any special software. I think I did this before, but I forgot, so I'll make a note of it again.

That's about 16GB of free space.

iTunes activated.
>>
This computer has been de-authorized to use the Apps installed on the iPhone &quot;Nishio_iPhone&quot;. Do you want to?
&lt;&lt;
I wondered what was going on, but all I was asked for was my AppStore password.
>>
Of the five computers available for authentication, two are authenticated.
&lt;&lt;
I was a little concerned about what would happen when I replaced four more units, but I decided to evaluate the delay because I'd forget about it anyway even if I looked it up.
&lt;/body>

&lt;body>I've never been to 5 computers, so I don't know, but I think you should access it on your old computer and de-authenticate iTunes. It's in the pull-down menu somewhere. &lt;/body>
