<p>What is “<a href="./Clean-Language-as-a-Board-Game" class="internal alias" data-slug="Clean-Language-as-a-Board-Game">Clean Language as a Board Game</a>”?</p>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>I’d like to verbalize a little more about “Clean Language as a Board Game.”
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>What kind of “clean language” is that “clean language”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>The original Clean Language was people talking to people. We’ve made that a reality in the form of chatbots, using ChatGPT to make the conversation natural, but I feel like we’ve moved away from value. In fact, I think it is more appropriate to view it as a “board game” rather than a “conversation,” which is what I realized last time.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>Is there anything else you can tell us about that “clean language”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>And when I say board game, I mean figuratively, not literally creating a board game.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>What kind of “board game” is this “board game”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Right now, the UI is like a chat screen with a dialogue metaphor, but if it’s a board game, the information should be presented in such a way that humans don’t have to remember it.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>Is there anything else you can tell us about that “board game”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>The “status,” “degree of goal attainment,” and “approaching goal” need to be visualized in a way that is easy to understand.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>What is the “degree of achievement” of this “degree of achievement”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>I think it is important to “gain awareness” and “decide on the next action,” and since the latter is only one of them, it is better to set the latter as the final goal. However, I feel that there are cases in which it is not necessary to decide on the next action, so it is a question of what to do.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>What kind of “latter” is this “latter”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>“Next Action Language” I feel like this one should be a one-shot clear once accomplished. I think this should be cleared once achieved, because it is better to move on to the implementation of the action without continuing the chat. I think “Awareness” should be cleared when 3 points are earned.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>What kind of “Next Action” is this “Next Action”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>To decide what to do next.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>What kind of “what next” is that “what next”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>When you are bothered and unable to verbalize and worry, it is like standing still in a fog, but if you stand still, the scenery will not change and you will continue in the same state. It is not essentially important what you do next, but what is important is that you feel like doing something and move forward
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>What is it that you value?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>To have your concerns resolved and lead to action.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>What kind of “action” is this “action”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Anything is fine. It is important that he/she is willing to do it.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>What are those “feelings”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Enthusiasm? A state of heightened motivation
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>What kind of “enthusiasm” is that?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Image like energy for action.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>Is there anything else you can tell us about that “action”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Actions lead to results, right, and you feel negative about critiquing without acting.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>Where is the “action”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Coming out of the people.

</li>
<li>Where does this “action” come from?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>When the goal is a blur, you can’t see it, but when it’s clear, it comes out, it separates from the blurred goal and takes shape.

<li>How do you know this “behavior”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>I can tell if I am acting or not. We can’t observe what others are doing because their actions are often not public. It’s called “trial and error is hard to see.” So you have to take many times more actions than others seem to be taking to get the same amount of action.

</li>
<li>What does this “behavior” look like?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Actions do not correspond one-to-one to rewards. This is because actions do not always lead to results. So if you expect a reward, you lose motivation when the action is not rewarded. I imagined a lottery or a gacha, but it’s not quite the same. Even if you don’t win the lottery, you need to feel satisfaction when you take the action. I wonder what it is. Jelly beans?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>What would you like to see happen with respect to that “action”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>If you’re going from not seeing the action, you better see it. If you can see the action, you better be enthusiastic about doing it.

</li>
<li>The original Clean Language was for conversation, realized in the form of chatbots</li>
<li>Realized as a board game rather than a dialogue, visualization of information is important.</li>
<li>“Becoming aware” is cleared by earning 3 points, with one Next Action as the final goal.</li>
<li>It is important to feel like doing something and moving forward. We need to see action and do as little as possible.</li>
<li>Behavior does not have a one-to-one correspondence to reward, but must be satisfying at the time it is acted upon</li>
<li>Jelly beans?”</li>
<li>What to do next is blurred and invisible, but once the action is taken and the goal is clear, we think about it.</li>
<li>Next Action: Start by taking action</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>(Yes, I know, GPT can’t find a next action in the current situation, either.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Let’s delve into information visualization.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>What kind of “visualization” is this “visualization”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>The appearance of metaphors is approaching awareness. I haven’t visualized it yet in this case, but it would be nice to visualize the degree of development for each keyword. I haven’t noticed it because I haven’t visualized it, but it might help improve the algorithm. It might be better to visualize the score for each keyword as well.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>Is there anything else about that “visualization”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Simply visualizing it will help debugging and improvement. As for general user use, it’s confusing when there’s a lot of mystery out there, so it needs to be hidden. It would be nice if it could be turned on or off in the developer options.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>Where is this “visualization”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Still no. When I put it on my phone screen, it’s narrow. On a phone, it’s a tab, on a PC, side by side, maybe.

<li>Where is this “clean language”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>I’m not sure where the clean language element is in the visualization, there are two things, the stack of stories and the development of key words. I’ve done this in coaching with human counterparts, but I’ve never mechanically visualized it in a chat log in Keichobot. I’ll do it manually first, then figure out how to do a mechanical visualization. This is a Next Action.

<li>He realized that it is important to encourage action.</li>
<li>Direct alignment of goals and rewards is not important; rather, enjoyment and satisfaction must be found in the action itself.</li>
<li>Information visualization on the chatbot is under consideration. The stack of utterances and the degree of keyword development are considered key factors.</li>
<li>After manual visualization, mechanical methods need to be considered.</li>
<li>Next actions are manual implementation of visualization and consideration of mechanization methods.

<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>The original Clean Language was people talking to people. We’ve made that a reality in the form of chatbots, using ChatGPT to make the conversation natural, but I feel like we’ve moved away from value. In fact, I think it is more appropriate to view it as a “board game” rather than a “conversation,” which is what I realized last time.</li>

<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>I think it is important to “gain awareness” and “decide on the next action,” and since the latter is only one of them, it is better to set the latter as the final goal. However, I feel that there are cases in which it is not necessary to decide on the next action, so it is a question of what to do.

  - What does this &quot;behavior&quot; look like?
  - <img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Actions do not correspond one-to-one to rewards. This is because actions do not always lead to results. So if you expect a reward, you lose motivation when the action is not rewarded. I imagined a lottery or a gacha, but it's not quite the same. Even if you don't win the lottery, you need to feel satisfaction when you take the action. I wonder what it is. Jelly beans?

I haven’t visualized it yet in this case, but it would be nice to visualize the degree of development for each keyword. I haven’t noticed it because I haven’t visualized it, but it might help improve the algorithm. It might be better to visualize the score for each keyword as well.</li>

<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Simply visualizing it will help debugging and improvement. As for general user use, it’s confusing when there’s a lot of mystery out there, so it needs to be hidden. It would be nice if it could be turned on or off in the developer options.</li>

I'll do it manually first, then figure out how to do a mechanical visualization. This is a Next Action.
