<blockquote>
<p>When we reduce abstract concepts that have no physical form to physical sensations, we often create parables. Since abstract concepts have no form in reality, we compare them to other things that exist in reality. A metaphor can be taken as a physical sensation or experience that has not yet been verbalized below the surface, but is barely verbalized through the uncommon use of language.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you drop an abstract concept that does not have a physical shape to a physical sensation, a parable tends to be born. Since an abstract concept does not have a form in reality, it can be compared to another existing thing in reality. In parable stories, it can be thought that body sensations and experiences that are not yet linguished under the water are barely linguisticized by using words that are not common.</p>

<p>Uh‚Ä¶</p>
<ul>
<li>Abstract concepts have no physical form. When we bring them closer to concrete physical sensations, they often give rise to parables.</li>
<li>Why. Abstract concepts cannot be captured by the physical senses because they have no physical form. By trying to capture it with the physical senses, we begin to use objects that have physical form in place of the concept.</li>
<li>In a parable, words are used to mean something different from their common meaning. Through this uncommon use, your experience, which is not yet in the form of words, barely partially becomes a form of words.

<p>+Experiments that elicited creativity in the previous picture included the metaphor of plants and the metaphor of nuclear fusion. Young also compared the process of idea creation to a coral reef.

Ideas are also the final fruit of countless small activities going on beneath our consciousness.</p>

<p>-A metaphor is a parable that does not explicitly state that it is strictly metaphorical. Warming up an idea is a metaphor: ‚ÄúAn idea is like an egg. However, for the purposes of this chapter, this distinction is not important, so you can think of a metaphor as a parable.
+A metaphor is a parable that does not explicitly state that it is strictly metaphorical. For example, ‚Äúwarming up an idea‚Äù is a metaphor. An idea is like an egg. When it is first produced, it does not move, but by warming it up, it becomes a chick and begins to move on its own.

<p>It‚Äôs unclear who the ‚Äúet al.‚Äù are.
I‚Äôm referring to the author of the Symbolic Modelling one.
Do you refer to the source as ‚Äúin this book‚Äù rather than the person?</p>
<p>This part is translated as ‚Äúwhat kind of‚Äù in existing Japanese translations, but when actually used by Japanese people, it is often translated as ‚ÄúKind! but when actually used by Japanese people, it is often translated as ‚ÄúKind!
In Keichobot, ‚ÄúWhat ~ is?‚Äù changed to ‚ÄúWhat is it?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Especially ‚ù∂and‚ù∑ are important. For example, when the other person says ‚Äúthe sound of a bird,‚Äù you can ask, ‚ÄúWhat kind of bird is that?‚Äù You can ask, ‚ÄúWhat kind of bird is it?
If the other party answers ‚Äúduck call,‚Äù the abstract concept of ‚Äúbird call‚Äù becomes more concrete.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs how you keep digging deeper and deeper, and your horizons get narrower and narrower. So you can broaden your horizons by asking, ‚ÄúIs there anything else you can tell us about ducks?
For example, he/she replied, ‚ÄúI keep them at home.‚Äù We were able to get some information around the ducks.
The clarity of the metaphor is quite different between ‚Äúthe sound of birds‚Äù and ‚Äúthe sound of ducks at my parents‚Äô house.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Regarding the question of location, perhaps more examples would make it easier to answer.
I‚Äôm giving you an example first of thinking that creativity belongs to the team.</p>
<p>For example, ‚ÄúWhere is that ‚Äòcreativity‚Äô?‚Äù and you think, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs in my head,‚Äù then it‚Äôs ‚Äúin your head so the other team members can‚Äôt see it.‚Äù
When it comes to ‚Äúbetween team members.‚Äù
It derives from, ‚ÄúThat may not be consistent with the ideas the individual has,‚Äù or ‚ÄúHow do we get in a new team member?‚Äù</p>
<hr/>
<blockquote>
<p>and ‚ùπ heard almost the same thing. They focused on the position of the metaphor.
Those questions seem to contain a prejudice that X is not an abstract entity, but a concrete entity that occupies a place. This prejudice is driving the change from an abstract concept to a physical metaphor.</p>
<p>For example, ‚Äúcreativity‚Äù is obviously an abstract concept. Let us dare to ask. Where is your creativity? Think about it for a moment. Some will say it‚Äôs your head, others will say it‚Äôs your fingertips. It is a personal metaphor, so it is natural that it will differ from person to person.</p>
<p>I gave some examples in <a href="./6.2.3.1)-Drawing" class="internal alias" data-slug="6.2.3.1)-Drawing">6.2.3.1) Drawing</a>. One designer believes that creativity is initially in the brain and eventually spreads outside the brain. Another designer believes that creativity exists among team members.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhere is creativity?‚Äù Suppose you are asked. If you think ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs in my head,‚Äù that suggests that the creativity cannot be seen directly by other team members. If you thought, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs among the members,‚Äù that suggests that the creativity may not be aligned with each member‚Äôs thinking.</p>

<p>So far, I have compared what is verbalized and what is not to the part of the iceberg above and below the surface of the water.
We have progressed from an abstract concept near the summit to a physical sensation or metaphor near the water‚Äôs surface and approaching the water‚Äôs surface.
What is the closest thing to the surface of the water? I believe it is discomfort. In this section, I will explain tacit knowledge and discomfort. This is because tacit knowledge and discomfort are two sides of the same coin.</p>

<p>What I found particularly interesting was the step of using a dictionary. You look up key words in the dictionary that seem important in the short sentence and compare the dictionary description with what you meant to say. Since the words in the short sentences are words that I have tentatively applied to a felt sense that I cannot express well, there is often some discrepancy when I compare them with the dictionary explanation. I pay attention to that discrepancy, or discomfort.
What I found particularly interesting about TAE was the step of using a dictionary.
First, select key words from a short sentence that expresses your sense of what is important.
Then, look up the keywords in a dictionary.
Then, compare the dictionary description with what you want to say.
Words in short sentences temporarily point to a felt sense that you are unable to articulate well.
So, in many cases, there is some discrepancy with the dictionary description.

<p>I was strongly disconcerted when I looked up meditation in the dictionary and found that it means ‚Äúto meditate deeply and quietly with one‚Äôs eyes closed. The felt sense I was trying to describe with the word ‚Äúmeditation‚Äù does not require closing one‚Äôs eyes. Also, the expression ‚Äúmeditate on a thought‚Äù does not fit the image of trying to turn something and slowing down its rotation. The only words that fit me in this description are ‚Äúdeeply‚Äù and ‚Äúquietly‚Äù.
However, the sense does not match the dictionary definition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I looked up the word ‚Äúmeditation‚Äù in the dictionary.
Close your eyes and think deeply and quietly‚Äù.
I felt a strong sense of discomfort.</p>
<p>The felt sense I have tried to describe by the word ‚Äúmeditation‚Äù does not require closing your eyes.
Also, the expression ‚Äúthinking about‚Äù is trying to spin something, which is not consistent with the image of slowing down the spinning. This dictionary description only accepted the words ‚Äúdeep‚Äù and ‚Äúquiet‚Äù.</p>
<p>In other words, ‚Äúdeep‚Äù and ‚Äúquiet‚Äù seem to be the right words to describe my feeling. This seems to correspond to ‚Äúslowing down‚Äù. Conversely, the opposite of ‚Äúdeep‚Äù and ‚Äúquiet‚Äù should correspond to ‚Äúspinning at high speed.</p>
<ul>
<li>‚ÄúAre they spinning noisily?‚Äù
What is the opposite of ‚Äúdeeply‚Äù? Shallow‚Äù? High‚Äù?
Both are uncomfortable.
‚ÄòFloating‚Äô or ‚Äòoff the ground‚Äô is OK.</li>

<p>A philosopher Maurice Merleau-Ponty argued that personal private ‚Äúspeaking language‚Äù become shared public ‚Äúinstituted language‚Äù. By using the instituted language  multiple people can communicate. But at the creation of words, it is not instituted.</p>
<p>---almost rewrited
There are two types of words: public words and private words.</p>
<p>Consider two people, Alice and Bob. Dictionary definitions of words are shared, public terms. They are institutionalized for multiple people to communicate. In other words, these words are in the common domain of Alice and Bob.
On the other hand, the words Alice just spoke are in Alice‚Äôs private sphere. Therefore, we do not know whether Bob will feel that they mean what Alice expects them to mean.</p>
<p>The words you just spoke are private words, so don‚Äôt worry about whether or not others will understand them.
At the same time, the words we just spoke are private words, and we need to refine them to better express them in order to communicate them to others.</p>

<p>While you are arranging the cards, you sometimes feel that there is something wrong with placing this card next to that card.</p>
<p>I wrote about KJ method in X and Young‚Äôs method in Y.
In those method we write information on the card and then arrange those cards.</p>
<p>As you are arranging the cards, you often feel that there is something wrong with putting this card next to this card.</p>
<p>In the KJ method, after arranging the cards in a ‚Äúthis looks good here,‚Äù you ask yourself, ‚ÄúWhat is the reason for arranging them this way?‚Äù I ask myself.</p>
<p>Symbolic modeling had a similar question. It is ‚ÄúWhat is the relationship between X and Y?‚Äù The question is ‚ÄúWhat is the relationship between X and Y? Or, ‚ÄúAre X and Y the same or different?‚Äù That is.</p>
<p>Initially, the relationship between cards that have not yet been written is expressed.
The relationship, not yet verbalized, has become an observable entity.
Asking yourself questions about the expression of these relationships encourages them to become words.
Finally, write a short sentence describing the relationship, use it as a nametag, and bind the cards together.</p>
<p>I think this is why Jiro Kawakita said, ‚ÄúCards should not be classified. If you arrange cards according to existing classification criteria, you will answer the question, ‚ÄúWhat is the reason for arranging them in this way?
It does not have the effect of facilitating the verbalization of what has not yet been verbalized.</p>
<p>This is the most important part of the KJ method.
I have taught the KJ method to someone doing it for the first time.
Many people use reasons that are already verbalized when they lay out their cards.
The question ‚ÄúWhere is the right place?‚Äù is also asked verbally.
For first-timers, it is a natural question.
However, the use of verbalized reasons undermines the usefulness of the KJ method.</p>
<p>This is a technique that assists you in putting into words what is still unspoken within you. If you look outside of you for the right answer, you will never find it.</p>

<p>Note 41 On the other hand, this argument by Eric Ries assumes that there are a myriad of potential clients and that the experiment can be repeated over and over again. For example, if you have one evaluator and you are trying to get a job by appealing to his/her ability, you may not get another chance if the quality is too low. It is a trade-off between the effort you put in and the likelihood of being evaluated.
This is the difference between situations in which repeated experiments are possible and situations in which only one attempt is possible. Experimental science methodology assumes a situation in which repeated experiments are possible.
If you can only try once, you have to make difficult decisions in the tradeoff between the likelihood of being adopted and the effort you put into your appeal.</p>

In order to get out of this state, we need to encourage them to verbalize how they are feeling and absorb it.

<p>A difference of opinion is an opportunity to notice blind spots. When you do not accept information that contradicts your point of view, it is the Seeing state of U-theory. In this state, you cling to your existing frame of reference and do not accept information from others‚Äô perspectives.
Written by X.</p>
<p>To get out of this state, we need to understand the perspectives of others. To understand, we need to translate the unverbalized sensations of others into words. We cannot understand information while it is in someone else‚Äôs head. It is necessary to take it into oneself in as undistorted a state as possible.</p>
<p>Here again, the verbalization methods learned during the plowing phase come in handy. You can practice on yourself the skill of getting information out of your own mind. And you can use that skill to retrieve information from the minds of others, even if your opinion differs from theirs.</p>

<p>The customer wanted to express something. However, they did not know a good word to express it. So, I chose the word ‚Äútime machine‚Äù from among the words I knew. I thought that was the closest to what I wanted to express. This ‚Äútime machine‚Äù is a <a href="./metaphor" class="internal" data-slug="metaphor">metaphor</a>. This ‚Äútime machine‚Äù is the private language of the individual client who just spoke (I wrote about it in ‚Äú(6.2.5.5) Public and Private Words‚Äù).</p>

<ul>
<li>Suppose that after questioning the customer, he learned that the customer had inadvertently overwritten an important file and wanted to use a time machine to go back in time and retrieve the file. He wanted to use the term ‚Äútime machine‚Äù to describe a tool that would allow him to obtain the file after it had been overwritten but before it was overwritten. On the other hand, a programmer‚Äôs term would be ‚Äúa mechanism that automatically backs up and restores past files when needed. The client was not familiar with the concept of automatic backup, so he chose ‚Äútime machine‚Äù because it seemed the closest among the words he knew.
After questioning the customer, we learned that the customer had unintentionally overwritten an important file and wanted to go back in time and retrieve the file.
What is needed is ‚Äúa way to retrieve the file before it was overwritten‚Äù. That is a ‚Äútime machine‚Äù in his/her words.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, in the programmer‚Äôs words, it is ‚Äúsoftware that automatically backs up and restores past files when needed. Since the client was not familiar with the concept of ‚Äúautomatic backup,‚Äù he chose ‚Äútime machine.</p>
<p>These question are similar to the clean question described in <a href="./(6.2.4.2)-Clean-Language-and-Symbolic-Modeling" class="internal alias" data-slug="(6.2.4.2)-Clean-Language-and-Symbolic-Modeling">(6.2.4.2) Clean Language and Symbolic Modeling</a>.</p>

<p>There are not just a few knowledge fields, but countless. Knowledge fields have no clear boundaries. Knowledge areas are not independent, and learning one area increases the amount of knowledge in a nearby area.
To express this, a smoothly connected distribution chart with no clear axes is preferred, rather than a representation with values on several axes.</p>
<p>The field of knowledge is not static, but new and increasing every day.
To express this, it is more appropriate to use open lines rather than closed circles.</p>

If you have read ‚ÄúBlue Ocean Strategy,‚Äù you may recall the Cirque du Soleil strategy map. In comparing one‚Äôs own business with that of one‚Äôs competitors, the axes of comparison are not fixed, but newly created. If you are implicitly ignoring this newly created axis, you have a blind spot.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Many people think of learning as bringing something outside of you into you, and generating ideas as bringing something inside of you out of you, which are two opposite things.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It‚Äôs a difficult syntax, though I wrote it down because it‚Äôs kind of obvious in Japanese.</p>
<p>Many people think of learning as bringing something outside of yourself into yourself.
And they also think of creating ideas as bringing something inside of yourself out.
They think learning phase and creating phase are opposites.
Many people may think that learning is about taking what is outside of you and bringing it into you.
We also believe that generating ideas is about getting what is inside of you out.
We believe that the learning phase and the creating phase are opposites.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, this is not the case. If we divide the process of idea generation into three phases: the cultivating phase, the sprouting phase, and the nurturing phase, the cultivating phase was closely related to information gathering and the nurturing phase to verification. Information gathering and verification are the elements introduced in the learning cycle. I feel that learning and idea creation are not opposites, but almost the same thing. In other words, what happens at the moment of the germination of an idea is a new combination, the discovery of a connection between different things, the discovery of a pattern, modeling, and abstraction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh no, you don‚Äôt explain this well enough.
In ‚ÄúInformation Gathering and Verification, the Elements Introduced in the Learning Cycle.‚Äù
So what we think of as the ‚Äúidea creation process‚Äù is really a ‚Äúlearning cycle.
So what is called ‚Äúthe germ of an idea‚Äù is a new union, the discovery of a connection between different things, the discovery of a pattern, a modeling, an abstraction!</p>
