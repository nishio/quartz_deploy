While I think that there will certainly be difficulties and that there is a need for the cultivation and cultivation of the non-cognitive aspects, the article made me a little concerned that the Japanese universities and companies that came to visit may be asking for too much humility and cooperation.

I think that the PI’s in the laboratory of experimental science are required to have a very high management ability nowadays. However, on the other hand, the field of “individual play and risk-taking” has not disappeared. However, it is a field that is easily left behind due to the recent university reforms.

He had more than 10 siblings, didn’t read or write until he was 11, but was good at learning the flowers and plants in his garden. And as I recall, Kant was the son of a craftsman, and I think he was sent to college in a similar way.</p>

I nodded my head so much I thought I was going to lose my neck.</p>

I think it’s important to note that “there is no skipping a grade in the development of a child’s ability to successfully lead a life in society. Basic academic skills, cooperation, and the ability to get things done are still essential for growth.”</p>

<li>Maybe it’s too early to judge in 3 years, it will be 20 years before we know if this education is a success or not.</li>
<li>Comparing the loss in the lives of the children who have been told here that they were failures, to the benefit to society from the publication of this article, isn’t the benefit too little? What makes you happy?

<li>Parents expect their children to have a 100% chance of success, but my skinny is that these things are like “30% reach the line that about 3% of the average person reaches! Ten times the odds, wow!” It’s strange to expect a high success rate because it’s like that.</li>
<li>I think there are a lot of kids who feel that they give up too soon when things don’t go well, but there’s nothing wrong with running around with your interests until you’re 30 or so, is there?
<ul>
<li>I wonder if learning about multiple disciplines in this way will lead to <a href="./unforeseen-connections" class="internal alias" data-slug="unforeseen-connections">unforeseen connections</a> and <a href="./innovation" class="internal" data-slug="innovation">innovation</a> after the fact.</li>

<ul>
<li>Most of the public doesn’t even know enough to look it up on the Internet, though.</li>
<li>Well, that’s why even kids who can do just that are misidentified as “geniuses” by the dumb adults around them.</li>
