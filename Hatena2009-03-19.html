*1237421541*Diary covered with pollen
Yesterday, I stayed up all night and traveled outside for longer than usual, spoke orally a lot, and went to bed without showering after returning home, so when I woke up, my eyes, nose, and throat were in a terrible state.

&lt;hr>

In the past few days, the &quot;let's do that&quot; spills out of my head fast when I'm thinking of doing something. I find myself doing nothing and several hours have passed.

*1237445664*Leverage memo &quot;Pattern Language of Project Promotion and its Evaluation&quot;
I read it because @tnzk said he read it.
&lt;hr>
pattern language
Tacit knowledge sharing
40 patterns extracted from 15 project management books
Projects are &quot;in progress&quot;: Pattern Maps
It is only a hint, and the point is that actual experience is still important.
Patterns are not constraints.
Language does not create anything, but it makes people creative ‚Üê This is not an answer to the point that language constrains people's creativity. Sapir-Whorf.
&quot;The rules of the English language allow one to focus on fewer (though still quite a few) sentences that make sense, without having to wade through a vast number of meaningless sentences. As a result, one can devote one's full attention to the more subtle differences in meaning.
Display the co-occurrence frequencies in a graph ‚Üê A case with n selections will have n(n-1)/2 edges, but is there a risk that the case with many selections will be overemphasized? Is it necessary to check whether cases with many selections and cases with few selections show similar patterns? What if we normalize by the number of edges?
There was a project pattern 1.1: http://ilab.sfc.keio.ac.jp/2007/spring/conference/proceedings/ilab1-2007s-pattern1.1.pdf
Let's read this side.
&lt;hr>
bodystorming
Praise and praise, positive chain: don't start with negatives
Avoid snowballs: don't neglect even the smallest mistakes. Listing.
Prototyping: It may not be what you imagined when you put it into shape
Need a place to escape
Naming names makes it easier to discuss.
Machine gun process: isn't this an explanation of bodystorming?
Map it: If you can't see the goal, you'll get anxious.
Critical Point: When things are somehow not going well, you may be turning a blind eye to the problem. What is the critical point that is slowing down progress?
Gamification: Monotonous tasks reduce motivation. Turn it into a game.
Persona modeling: Assume a fictitious personality as the user of the deliverables
Storytelling: Check if it is not unreasonable to express how the deliverables are used as a single story, including the encounter with the user.
CHANGE! Don't force yourself to continue doing something you're tired of doing. Let's switch things up even within the same framework.
Improvisation: improvisation = improvised theater. Acting out the role of the user. Synthesis of persona modeling and storytelling
Scale conversions: avoid the middle ground. Think about what happens in extreme cases.
Dialogue Step: Conflicts of opinion are inevitable. We cannot move forward together without resolving conflicts. We need to talk about it thoroughly. It says, &quot;One side's opinion must be deleted,&quot; but it's OK for both sides to change. If one of us deletes the other's opinion, we may end up pointing out the flaws in each other's proposal, which would lead to a parallel line.
Prioritize: Once you have prioritized, you must be willing to discard the lower priorities if you don't have time to complete them. There is no point in prioritizing if you are so concerned about the low priority items that you complete the high priority items without finishing them in a timely manner.
Negative design: Don't pack in all the good stuff. You need to discard and select. The same can be said for this project pattern.
Worst point: By asking those who have major complaints what they are dissatisfied with, we can get a clear picture of what is being sought to the contrary.
Negative check: Once a proposal has taken shape, look at it with a critical attitude and list its flaws.
Review meeting: Set aside time to share lessons learned, experiences, and failures from the project.
Create patterns: Patterns are not something that binds users, but something that they create for themselves.
Nothing beats enthusiasm.
&lt;hr>
It was quite interesting. 1.1 is a draft of 2.0, I guess. I thought it was worth a read, although some formatting errors were noticeable. By the way, in &quot;Create Patterns,&quot; it was written, &quot;Let's add new patterns,&quot; and that's where &quot;negative design&quot; is important. 40 pieces is close to the limit of my memory or there is still room for more, I don't know, but at least &quot;the minimum text that I can remember the contents&quot; on a sheet of A4 paper. I think it's excessive if you can't list them. At any rate, I'm going to discard them and put only the ones that look good in my notebook.

*1237454594*Leverage memo &quot;Project Pattern 1.1&quot;
While writing the &lt;a href='http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nishiohirokazu/20090319/1237445664'>leverage memo &quot;Pattern Language of Project Promotion and Its Evaluation&quot;&lt;/a>, I got focused on the work (I get into a groove when I start working) and I was so excited that I was cutting it down and renaming it to put it in my notebook, and it looked good. I was writing the &lt; href='_blank'>leverage memo &quot;Pattern Language of Project Promotion and Evaluation of Project Promotion&quot;&lt;/ href='_blank'>leverage memo&lt;/ href='_blank'> and I was in the mood to cut it down and rename it for my notebook.

The original is at the URL below, but I didn't try to be faithful to the original (it was intended as a memo for my own use) and changed a lot, so it's more like &quot;inspired by&quot; than &quot;summarized&quot;.
http://ilab.sfc.keio.ac.jp/2007/spring/conference/proceedings/ilab1-2007s-pattern1.1.pdf

&lt;hr>
Bodystorming: If you can't think of it in your head, move your body. Go to the site. Make crafts.
Future Vision: To avoid &quot;it was surprisingly boring when I made it&quot;, I'll try to write down the scene when it's completed. Is it attractive?
Critical Character: While it is undesirable for criticism to create likes and dislikes among members, it is even worse to not criticize out of emotional consideration. Provide opportunities to play the &quot;criticizing character.
Clear goals: If goals are vague, a sense of accomplishment will not be achieved. You cannot check the degree of completion.
Praise and Praise: A positive chain of events: If you start with a negative and the other person goes into self-preservation mode, you will not be able to continue the dialogue. Continue the dialogue by first listening to what the other person has to say and starting with affirmation.
Avoid snowballs: Even small problems can grow if left unchecked. List and share at an early stage.
Be with design: Pay attention not only to functions and systems, but also to appearance. If we don't think something is in good taste, it will not be used.
Prototyping: It may not be what you envisioned when you put it into shape. You should confirm it at an early stage.
Schedules are alive: Schedules are not meant to be kept, they are meant to guide people. If circumstances change, you should change them.
Escape: When you get stuck, you need a place to escape. Forcing yourself to cling to a desk when you have lost your motivation and concentration will only wear you out.
Naming: Naming and defining facilitates discussion.
Break down: Complex problems should be broken down into smaller problems.
Small teams: Large teams are slow. However, if information is not shared closely among teams, there will be waste.
Clarify deadlines: If tasks are dependent on each other and one team's work is delayed, the other teams will have nothing to do. Clarify deadlines that must be met, and reschedule if they cannot be met.
Map it out: If you can't see the goal, you get anxious. Drawing the big picture and writing down what you are going to do makes your contribution visible and motivates you.
:Critical Point: People tend to move by inertia. When things are somehow not going well, they may be turning away from the problem. What is the critical point that is slowing down progress? If you don't defeat the middle boss, the story will not progress.
Gamification: Monotonous work lowers motivation. Add game elements. Make them compete for scores, time attack, etc. cf. Quantify results, the enemy is your past self
Quantification of results: Objective measurement and quantification of results will give a sense of accomplishment and frustration.
The enemy is your past: Don't compare yourself with others and don't get depressed. Look at how much you have grown compared to your past self.
Storytelling: Set up a fictitious persona as a user of the deliverables and check if it is reasonable to express how the deliverables are used as a story, including the encounter with the user. Act out the story as if you were the user.
: Other pollination: You can't remember what you don't know, even if you work hard with the same menagerie of people. Innovation is a new combination. You should seek new information.
: Change! : Don't force yourself to continue doing something you are bored with. You can replace many things even within the same framework. Physical changes cause changes in perspective and mood.
Extreme assumptions: avoid the middle ground. Consider the best case and the worst case. Consider what would happen under extreme circumstances.
Dialogue Step: Conflicts of opinion are inevitable. We cannot move forward together without resolving conflicts. It is necessary to discuss thoroughly. However, be careful not to follow parallel lines.
Prioritize: Once you have prioritized, you must be willing to discard the lower priorities if you don't have time to complete them. There is no point in prioritizing if you are so concerned about the low priorities that you complete the high priorities without finishing the high priorities.
Minus design: Don't cram all the good stuff in. You need to choose between the good and the bad.
Worst point: By asking people who have major complaints what they are complaining about, we can get a clear picture of what is being asked of them, as opposed to the other way around.
Negative check: Once you think something is good, you can't see its flaws. Once the idea takes shape, look at it with a critical attitude and list its flaws. cf. Critical Character
:Review meeting: Set aside time to share lessons learned/experiences/failures from the project. It is &quot;repeating failure&quot; for the organization to do what others have failed to do themselves.
Verbalization: Verbalize and record your ideas and images.
Create patterns: Patterns are not something that bind the user, but something that the user creates on his/her own.
Closing with emotion: Whether it is success or failure, make the end clear. If it ends somehow, you will not feel a sense of accomplishment or frustration.

*1237473636*[GAE]Try using app-engine-patch
I've been doing some development with Django on Google App Engine, but I think I'm missing out on about 80% of my Django life if I can't use that beautiful admin screen, so id:voluntas recommended I use the app-engine- patch recommended by id:voluntas.

http://code.google.com/p/app-engine-patch/

It's been about two weeks since version 1.0 was released. It should be considered a stable version - and it is. First, I read &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/app-engine-patch/wiki/GettingStarted&quot;>GettingStarted&lt;/a>. I see.

- Download Sample Projects
- In app.yaml, change &quot;application&quot; to the name of the application created by GAE's create application.
- Rewrite SECRET_KEY in settings.py with a random string. This is used in Django's standard anti-CSRF code or something like that: http://www.mail-archive.com/django-ja@googlegroups.com/msg00434.html
- Delete myapp. Well, I didn't really delete it, just commented it out.
>|diff|
 INSTALLED_APPS = (
 ...
-    'myapp',
     'registration',
     'mediautils',
 )
||&lt;

chmod +x manage.py and then . /manage.py runserver to start the development server. http://localhost:8000/„Å´„Ç¢„ÇØ„Çª„Çπ„Åô„Çã


Gee, it's &quot;Caught an exception while rendering: unknown encoding: X-MAC-JAPANESE&quot;.


Phew, calm down. I guess all I have to do is map X-MAC-JAPANESE to utf-8 at the beginning of settings.py.

>|python|
def register_x_max_ja():
    &quot;workaround of 'Caught an exception while rendering: unknown encoding: X-MAC-JAPANESE'&quot;
    import codecs
    from encodings.utf_8 import getregentry
    codecs.register(lambda name: getregentry() if name == 'x-mac-japanese' else None)

register_x_max_ja()
||&lt;

Well, let's reload. Hmm, the error message has changed. Caught an exception while rendering: Reverse for 'settings.myapp.views.list_people' with arguments '()' and keyword arguments '{}' not found. Is this Reverse?
There is an error here in the template.
>||
&lt;a href=&quot;{% url myapp.views.list_people %}&quot;>Generic views sample&lt;/a> |
||&lt;
According to id:voluntas, this is a function that allows you to write {% url func1 arg1 arg2 %} instead of /some/url/prefix/of/func1/and/{{ arg1 }}/{{ arg2 }} using URL mapper's information I heard that's what it is. Hmmm...I guess they're just mad that they can't find it because I deleted myapp. I'll put it back.

&lt;img src=&quot;http://gyazo.com/f26620ca4bd7b568a316766dba8d471a.png&quot;>
Motion!

Oh, there is such a thing as generate admin user. I'm going to create an admin account and access the admin screen.

&lt;img src=&quot;http://gyazo.com/c6d1a9c7ea2068f306941a7a948ae519.png&quot;>

It is working perfectly. I tested if it is OK to use Japanese. I think it's OK because it's displayed in Japanese.

&lt;img src=&quot;http://gyazo.com/72c56c90c292d0e19fdf818681bcf902.png&quot;>

Yup. It's working perfectly fine. It's easy. It took me only an hour to do it, starting from reading the documentation. I'm going to upload the file to Google today.

&lt;hr>

Postscript:
Create application foobar with -startapp
Look at -myapp/urlauto.py and imitate
Write -foobar/url.py
Create -foobar/template/index.html
Write -foobar/views.py
Write -foobar/models.py
I looked at -/admin and the model I just created doesn't show up in the admin panel?
Look at -myapp/admin.py and imitate
-I went out to the admin screen!
-Create an application
-manage.py update
-I could have done it.

It's already 6:00 in the morning and I don't feel like writing a polite commentary.
&lt;/body>
