- Differences between books and Scrapbox
- Scrapbox is excellent for pointing to information because it comes with human-readable permalinks and redirects to connect even if renamed.
- Scrapbox-like if ebooks had the ability to select portions of text and create permalinks
- Content first, <a href="./title-after-the-fact" class="internal alias" data-slug="title-after-the-fact">title after the fact</a> method is better

- Scrapbox
- No attributes on the link itself
- Instead, contextual information is made an attribute of the link by bracketing its occurrence in the sentence.
- A method for extracting meaning from the occurrence of surrounding words

- > A: Knowledge is the accumulation of facts and ideas; wisdom is the application of knowledge to make decisions in real-world situations.
- > Knowledge may come from books, but wisdom must come from experience.
- A better form of knowledge representation may be “a form that is easy to apply”.
- Then the next question becomes, “What is the application of knowledge?” becomes

- > Knowledge transfer without verbalization by sharing the work process.
- A better form of knowledge expression may not be words.
- Well, LLM’s weight is not in words.
- We use language as an interface for human beings and communication.
- <a href="./I-know." class="internal alias" data-slug="I-know.">I know.</a>
- > Knowing” is better than “not knowing. However, there is not much difference in knowledge that can be easily acquired through search, because those who realize they “don’t know” can easily change to “know”. Those who “think they know” and believe in false knowledge are worse off than those who “don’t know” because they don’t have the opportunity to search for and acquire correct knowledge.
- The value of “knowledge that can be easily acquired through search” is low.

- In other words, in order to create a system that works for me, I can’t just let people read my Scrapbox, I need to let them read what I don’t know and find the quickest way to connect it to what I already know.

- > Decline in the correlation between “storing useful knowledge” and “being able to generate useful knowledge”
- > Usefulness of applying “knowledge accumulated in the past” to a new environment/compared to “acquiring knowledge quickly from a new environment
- When the time came to start thinking about “better forms of knowledge representation,” it was “how to store knowledge.”
- But maybe it’s not about “storing” but about “creating” and “acquiring.”
- “Generating” may be a prelude to “applying” by “finding a relationship.”
