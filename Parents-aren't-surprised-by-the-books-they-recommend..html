I think even adults have experienced that the more strongly a book is recommended to them, the less likely they are to read it. It is as if the credit for discovering something interesting has been preempted! You found it interesting, didn’t you? or “You found it interesting, didn’t you? Even adults have this psychological reaction.</p>

It seems to me that they don’t read books and illustrated books because their parents expect them to and force them to, and they don’t study. Dislike of books and study seems to be a phenomenon caused by people who expect or force them to do so.</p>

The child hates books, doesn’t study, doesn’t do his/her homework, etc. The child doesn’t like books, doesn’t study, doesn’t try to do his/her homework. They try to relieve their own frustration by putting labels on their children out of spite.</p>

The parents would enumerate the things that were wrong with their child, perhaps with the intention of showing humility. The child would turn away with a bitter look on his/her face. I would read all the bad things the parents said into the child’s strengths and be amazed, “You have such an interesting point! I was surprised.</p>

I have heard that when a third party says such a thing to a child, it makes the child reevaluate the label that had been attached to him or her, and he or she is motivated to observe the child again calmly. When you observe, you realize that this child is often doing his/her best in his/her own way. They also realize that they had been frustrated with their own expectations of their own child, who was not able to keep up with them.</p>

It seems that if a person does not deserve our expectations, we do not expect them from the beginning, and if we do expect them, it is because we recognize them, and we should be grateful for the “gift” of recognition.</p>

But in more than a few cases, the expectations make us feel overwhelmed. What if we don’t deliver what is expected of us? The anxiety often precedes the expectation, and the mind often becomes overwhelmed. They may lose their energy and motivation.</p>
