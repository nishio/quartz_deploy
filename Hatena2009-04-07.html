Hmmm, CopyPast copies RemoveCard, so if I put it on MakeBit, it has a 1/2 chance of being erased (the AI is still not smart enough to erase with a probability of 1).

I wonder if Float copies Reverse, chaos ensues. I'm not sure if I can win with 9 pieces on the table. If there is no danger of MakeBit being erased, I can make a loop with MakeBit, Reverse, and CopyPast of the weak AI and make a lot of bits in Crack. I'd pile up a lot of bits in Crack, and then pass Reverse, but I'm afraid that there's a 1/2 chance that it will be erased.

Execution.

With the alternating placement rule, I'd have to win by about the 4th piece against the current AI. I'm too weak at the beginning of the game. Well, let's play it as a check of operation.

Bomb, Crack, Float(Crack), Crack, and that's it? I didn't even feel like organizing the logs. It is too bad that there is no strategy at all at the beginning of the game, because the game is decided at the beginning of the game. Maybe I should try to implement Monte Carlo.

*1239081211* Oh my god.
We can find many problems by letting the AIs fight each other automatically. At the same time, they forgot to check the cases that meet the death conditions.

The error that the card cannot be found is due to CopyPast disappearing in [Charm][MoveCard][CopyPast (Y)] and then MoveCard causing the move, followed by &quot;reconfigure PC with the location of the currently running card&quot;.

{'draw': 29, &quot;ValueError('list.remove(x): x not in list',)&quot;: 35, &quot;RuntimeError('Too Long Play',)&quot;: 120, &quot;ValueError('list.index(x): x not in list',)&quot;: 18, &quot;IndexError('list index out of range',)&quot;: 57, 'Computer': 370, 'You': 371}

{'draw': 33, &quot;ValueError('list.remove(x): x not in list',)&quot;: 34, &quot;RuntimeError('Too Long Play',)&quot;: 125, &quot;ValueError('list.index(x): x not in list',)&quot;: 17, &quot;IndexError('list index out of range',)&quot;: 35, 'Computer': 380, 'You': 376}

{'draw': 35, &quot;ValueError('list.remove(x): x not in list',)&quot;: 34, &quot;RuntimeError('Too Long Play',)&quot;: 128, &quot;ValueError('list.index(x): x not in list',)&quot;: 17, &quot;IndexError('list index out of range',)&quot;: 21, 'Computer': 382, 'You': 383}

It is slowly being resolved, though.

Hmm.

in the end
>>
 Is it acceptable for the rule [MIMIC][BOMB][x] to execute x after MIMIC is removed? In other words, the interpretation is that the atomic instruction [BOMB &amp; x] has already been fetched. If [GOTO &amp; x] triggers x, it would be less exceptional if it also triggers this one.
&lt;&lt;
So this design decision was wrong. When something like [MIMIC][BOMB][FLOAT], the card that should have been moved has already disappeared. Should I have thrown an exception for card disappearance?
