Mistakes in understanding are often made by those who prematurely assume they &quot;get it&quot; without delving into difficult concepts.
<p>It is natural to be tempted to argue “that’s not true,” especially when a newcomer denies a concept that you have previously appreciated. It is important to understand, however, that “understanding” is subjective, and that simply bouncing “senses” off each other will not lead to a solution. Just because you already know something does not guarantee that your understanding is correct.</p>
<p>The appropriate degree is, “That’s how you understand it; it’s not how I understand it.” If you insist here that “you are wrong,” the burden of proving the error arises.</p>
<p>So how can we do this? The answer is that “understanding” should be tested through experimentation. If you act on your understanding and it produces positive results, then you can assume that your understanding was correct. This is the subject in which we should invest our time and attention.</p>
<p>However, people who engage in “conclusions that are unreasonable from their point of view,” without sufficient context and without sufficient willingness to investigate, are not attractive subjects in which to invest time.</p>

<li>Feeling like you understand something is no guarantee that you really understand it. The feeling of understanding occurs when a provisional model is created in your brain. Whether that model is correct or not needs to be verified. Verification is done by actually using that model and observing the results.</li>

<li>As a result of our experiments in trying to explain, we often find ourselves saying, “Huh? This is a bit fuzzy in my understanding. As we find and eliminate such vague points, a “dense network of interconnected information” is created in our brains. Once this is in place, it is useful to be able to trace the connections and pull them out as needed.</li>

<li>The only way to confirm understanding is to output and observe whether the system outside of you reacts as you understand. If it does not respond as understood, the error of understanding is confirmed. Reacting as you understand does not guarantee that your understanding is correct. It may be a fluke. No matter how hard you try, you will never achieve 100% understanding.</li>
<li>This is a story on a different layer. Each individual has a finite amount of resources (money, time, etc.), so he or she must decide for himself or herself what and how much to allocate resources to. How best to allocate them depends on your objectives and the amount of resources you have.</li>
<li>This is not to say that consulting with others about resource allocation strategies is entirely futile, but it is difficult to have a useful discussion without clarifying the resources you have and the objectives you want to achieve.</li>
<li>Let’s say I want to understand X. Is this “understanding of X” the end goal? Is this “understanding of X” the ultimate goal? If the devil appeared to you and said, “I will give you the understanding of X, but you will die as soon as you understand X,” would you sign the contract? However, as soon as you understand X, you will die. Would you not? Then “understanding X” is not the final goal. It is merely a means to another end.</li>
<li>The suffering of “there are so many things I should learn that I can’t catch up with my understanding” stems from one’s mind pursuing an unrealistic ideal. The gap between the real me and the image of “the me who understands difficult books smoothly” is the same composition as the gap between “the me who lives forever” and “the me who does not grow old”.</li>

<p>You can’t just look up a difficult concept and say, “Okay, I get it! That’s how it is!” about a difficult concept without doing much research.</p>
<p>When that “understanding” is at odds with your own understanding, especially when someone who has recently learned about something you have appreciated positively for a longer time is evaluating it negatively, you want to say, “That’s not so.</p>
