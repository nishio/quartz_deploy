*1203474464*RSS
I just realized that subscribing to a blog's RSS feed is a growing pile of reading. If you buy a book that looks good and just pile it up at home, the book itself will not increase, but if you find a blog that looks good and pile it up in your LDR, it will increase and increase. The amount of time people spend reading does not increase. I have 4679 unread items in my LDR and 7339 unread items in my GMail.

*1203475172*Bits of life
I was thinking on my walk to work this morning that a year is halfway through, like 365 days. But there are about 50 holidays, which would be nice if I counted more of them. If I count Saturday as double the number of weekdays and Sunday as triple the number of weekdays, I get 150 more days, which is roughly 512!

Let us call one unit of activity time 2 hours. Assuming 2 units on weekdays and 5 units on weekends, the total number of activity hours in a year is 1024 units. That's a good number!

And if life's active time is roughly 64 years, life is 16 bits! That's a lot of bits!

*1203477403*Continued BlockSorting(BWT)
BlockSorting - NISHIO Hirokazu's Hatena Diary http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nishiohirokazu/20080218/1203322931

After reading it properly, I understood it. So the nth &quot;X&quot; leads to the nth &quot;X&quot;. I wonder how to write it elegantly...

I wrote the letters as they were written.

>|python|
# Restore
from collections import defaultdict
count = defaultdict(int)
def inc(c):
    count[c] += 1
    return count[c]

tails = [(c, inc(c)) for c in tails]
heads = list(sorted(tails))

cur = start
result = []

print start # => 1
print tails # => [('b', 1), ('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('a', 2)]
print heads # => [('a', 1), ('a', 2), ('b', 1), ('b', 2)]

for i in range(len(tails)):
    pair = heads[cur]
    result.append(pair[0])
    cur = tails.index(pair)

print &quot;&quot;.join(result) # => abba
||&lt;

Hmmm... I wonder what the person who came up with this was thinking when he came up with it. It's amazing.

-----

I guess I should call it BlockSorting or maybe BWT since I still sort everything normally.

I did a BWT on this source to try it out and this is what I got. It sure looks like it shrinks easily.

*1203513776* Handwritten
[f:id:nishiohirokazu:20080220222157p:image]

Wow. What I wanted to do got done first.

You can't edit it, can you?

*1203522287*[Perl]local is a great case.
Write before you forget what you have been taught.

>||
C:\>perl -e &quot;$a = {x=>0}; {$a->{x} = 1; print $a->{x};} print $a->{x};&quot;
11

C:\>perl -e &quot;$a = {x=>0}; {my $a->{x} = 1; print $a->{x};} print $a->{x};&quot;
Can't use an undefined value as a HASH reference at -e line 1.

C:\>perl -e &quot;$a = {x=>0}; {local $a->{x} = 1; print $a->{x};} print $a->{x};&quot;
10
||&lt;

local $a = ... I can understand if $a reverts to its original value after exiting the scope with &quot;$a = ...&quot;, but I don't understand that even what is written in the hash reverts to its original value!

-----

Postscript. Notice that $a->{y} is properly obtained in the block.

C:\>perl -e &quot;$a = {x=>0, y=>1}; {local $a->{x}=2; print $a->{y}} print $a->{x};&quot;

>>
Youchan 2008/02/21 08:33 Isn't it a variable that points to a different area rather than a value being restored?
I'm a little uncomfortable with the expression &quot;back to normal.
&lt;&lt;

Of course, that's generally why the value of a variable appears to revert back to its original value when it leaves scope, but the emphasis of this entry is &quot;even what appears to be a destructive rewriting of a hash (appears to be) reverting back to its original value!&quot; That's what I'm talking about. If you're talking about why that kind of behavior happens, of course $a is supposed to point to a different region at &quot;local $a->{x} = 1;&quot;. But I wonder if it copies the whole thing. Or is it in such a way that it only goes to refer to the original $a when it can't find the key?

*1203524977*[Perl]OOP
>|Perl|
C:\>perl -e &quot;sub makeCounter { my $class = shift; my $self = {}; bless $self, $c
lass; $self->{count} = 0; return $self; } sub push { my $self = shift; $self->{c
ount}++; print $self->{count}; return $self; } main->makeCounter()->push()->push
()->push();&quot;
123
||&lt;

I made a counter for now.

>|Perl|
sub makeCounter {
    my $class = shift;
    my $self = {};
    bless $self, $class;
    $self->{count} = 0;
    return $self;
}
sub push {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->{count}++;
    print $self->{count};
    return $self;
} 
main->makeCounter()->push()->push()->push();
||&lt;

I got stuck in a strange error where I wrote &quot;bress&quot; for &quot;bless&quot;, &quot;return $self;&quot; for &quot;return self;&quot;, and &quot;there is no package named self&quot;.
I guess the latter means that return self; was interpreted as a package name because it returned a string in bareword and used -> for a non-blessed string.

*1203525751* Written by.
I was depressed, but I had the most fun when I was asking about Perl OOP. I feel like you'd have more fun listening to me talk about Perl for 2 hours than spending 2 hours or something on a game.

*1203526884* nameplate
>>
Good thing I had my name tag ready.
This time, for the first time, I prepared nametags for the study group. If you go to a regular stationery store and buy a set of 50 nameplates, you can get them for only about 3,000 yen, while the price of one proper nameplate is about 200 yen. I bought mine at Tokyu Hands, but I think you can find them at larger stationery stores.
&lt;&lt;

Ah.
I had thought about making nametags for the next conference when I attended the 1st 1000 Speakers Conference, but I completely forgot about it until now. I can't afford to go out and buy one.

*1203527560*[Python] block comment
When you are writing code, there are times when you want to temporarily comment out a block of code without executing it. In Python, which does not have block commenting, you can put the block in triple quotes to make it a string literal or disable it with if 0:~, but while messing around with it, you may lose track of what block it was. I would not recommend this to others.

Today, I suddenly thought of this code and tried it:

>|python|
...
if not &quot;generate sample data&quot;:
    ...

||&lt;

If you think of &quot;not&quot; as &quot;don't,&quot; it is easy to understand that you can put &quot;not&quot; when you don't want to do something, and you can take &quot;not&quot; off when you want to do it again. In general, commenting out a block of code strongly implies that the block is a semantically related block, so it may be promoted to a function in the future, as shown below.

>|python|
...
def generate_sample_data():
    ...

||&lt;

I wonder.

*1203528974*CRF
http://hillbig.cocolog-nifty.com/do/2008/02/post_7fbc_1.html

I found out today what CRF is and how it differs from HMM:
http://www.geocities.co.jp/Technopolis/5893/publication/NLP2006.pdf

HMM is a generative model, which adjusts some parameters of the model based on the actual observed strings so that the &quot;probability (likelihood) of spitting out the observed strings&quot; is the highest....

No, not when learning, but when using it for identification?

Oh well, I'll read it slowly next time.

&lt;body>HMM and CRF both try to learn the training data sequence that has the highest probability of being output (maximum likelihood estimation),&lt;br>but they have different probability models: HMM has a form P(X,Y) that also generates the input sequence, so that the sum of &lt;br>all possible input sequences at training time Σ_{x,y}P(X,Y) can be computed efficiently. Since the probabilistic model of CRF is P(Y|X), the sums for X do not need to be &lt;br>computed, and only the sums for Y need to be&lt;br>computed efficiently. &lt;br>Therefore, CRF offers much more freedom on the X side&lt;br>than HMM. For example, CRF differs from HMM in that duplicated information in X can be freely included in the model. &lt;br>For example, if Y is a part-of-speech sequence, the word immediately preceding it, the word immediately following it, and the part-of-speech information can &lt;br>be used together to determine the part-of-speech of a part of the sequence (i.e., the feature function can be freely defined). &lt;/body>
