<li>He wrote, “You can’t put boxes in the air, they have to be stacked sequentially from the base.”</li>
<li>There are some types of people who don’t have this “need”.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, I recognized one person in the “case that cannot be established” that I am thinking of now after I turned 40, following the path of “Nada Junior High School → Nada High School → Kyoto University” with a high concentration of weirdos, and after a while, I think there was another one in the past, so I think there is no more than one in 10,000 people in the population ratio.</p>
<ul>
<li>A few more, depending on where you put the boundaries.</li>
</ul>
<p>They X can put boxes in the air.</p>
<ul>
<li>We need to ask what exactly “<a href="./ground" class="internal" data-slug="ground">ground</a>” means.
<ul>
<li>The <a href="./ground" class="internal" data-slug="ground">ground</a> is just a <a href="./shared-belief" class="internal alias" data-slug="shared-belief">shared belief</a> that “it is OK to <a href="./delving-into" class="internal alias" data-slug="delving-into">delving into</a> this far” held by the majority of people.</li>

- I recognize this as “someone who tries to put a box in the air and it falls down.”</p>
<ul>
<li>X is different from both.
<ul>
<li>Can put boxes in the air and still assemble things without falling off</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Why is this possible?</p>
<ul>
<li>Thinking of this in terms of the gravity and box metaphor seems impossible, so a different model is needed

<p>Maybe “net.”</p>

<li>In “Knowledge, Capitalism and the Technologist Condition,” which I wrote in 2012, I used the metaphor of a net instead of the metaphor of stacking boxes</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The “stacking of boxes” is a metaphor for “gravity” and “the box below is the support.”</p>
<ul>
<li>In fact, there is no gravity, but “<a href="./the-more-connected-things-are,-the-more-stable-they-are" class="internal alias" data-slug="the-more-connected-things-are,-the-more-stable-they-are">the more connected things are, the more stable they are</a>.”</li>

<li>Not connected to other things, connected to one thing, or connected to several things, the latter being more reliable.</li>

<p>If you can build a body of knowledge that is interconnected, there is not much difference between doing something that is conventionally considered “basic” and something that is not.</p>

<li>The psychological cost to many people of doing things the “right way” when the adults, teachers, and classmates closest to them believe that they should do things the way they are shown on the left is high.</li>
<li>Need “<a href="./My-Values" class="internal alias" data-slug="My-Values">My Values</a>” such as strong <a href="./curiosity" class="internal" data-slug="curiosity">curiosity</a> and “<a href="./ability" class="internal" data-slug="ability">ability</a> not to sympathize” with existing values</li>

<li>
<p>Before the Internet, information sharing through paper books became less and less specialized.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is because specialized content is less profitable for publishers from a business standpoint.</li>
<li>It was necessary to follow one of the few footholds in this era</li>
<li>It usually became something to be traced in order from the bottom up.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Internet has lowered the cost of information sharing, allowing countless pieces of information to be shared.</p>
<ul>
<li>Countless footholds have been created, making it possible to explore as one’s curiosity dictates.</li>
<li>It is now possible to create a “densely connected knowledge network” even when learning in a way that is not on the “rails of existing learning methods”.</li>
