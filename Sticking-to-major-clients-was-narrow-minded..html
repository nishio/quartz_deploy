Sticking to major clients was narrow-minded.</p>
<ul>
<li>When we made the decision to cut our major clients, who account for 60-70% of our sales, we began to see a new landscape.</li>
<li>Not being swayed by major clients, the company has been able to strengthen relationships with other clients and acquire new projects more smoothly.</li>
<li>He regrets that it was his own narrow-mindedness that caused him to stick to his major clients.</li>
<li>Although risky, we keenly felt that we could not expand our company‚Äôs potential if we were dependent on our main business partners.</li>
<li>The company succeeded in receiving orders for prototypes from overseas manufacturers, which is a difficult task, and felt that there was room for growth for their company.</li>
<li>We believe that we are now at a turning point for our company and have made the decision to cut off a major business partner that has been with us for 40 years.</li>
<li>The key to his future success will be his own determination and the empowerment of his employees.</li>
<li>Although there is uncertainty, we have found room for growth by taking on challenges in new fields while respecting our company‚Äôs origins.</li>
<li>We will be able to confidently promote our company at next week‚Äôs sales visit.</li>
