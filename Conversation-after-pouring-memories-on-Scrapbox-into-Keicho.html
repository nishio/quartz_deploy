Conversation after pouring memories on Scrapbox into Keicho</p>
<p>It’s okay to have a conversation from Scrapbox with the logs, because Keicho’s side has the same memory as on Scrapbox, but if the page is written on Scrapbox side, Keicho’s side has no memory, so I’m not sure what to do.</p>
<ul>
<li>The use case could be both.
<ul>
<li>I’m writing in Scrapbox and I’m stuck on the line I’m writing and I need a question on the line I’m writing.</li>
<li>I’m writing in Scrapbox and I’ve finished a piece of writing, but I want to improve it, so I want you to ask me questions wherever you like.
<ul>
<li>A possible workaround for this would be to start with all of the Scrapbox content in “listen first” mode.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>On this one, I thought starting with a range selection would be a natural way to express which range you want the bot to know about.
<ul>
<li>Just a bad idea to make the selection a single statement.
<ul>
<li>The quotes are per statement, so if you make a statement that has one page, you’ll get a one-page citation every time you make a statement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>So if some large area is selected the first time, it seems like it needs to be handled as “put it in phase mode and make it a one-line statement at a time”.</li>
<li>Conversely, if you can do that, I think you can suddenly start Keicho from all selections on any page in the past and “quote the line you are most interested in and ask a question”.</li>
</ul>

Conversely, if you can do that, I think you can suddenly start Keicho from all selections on any page in the past and “quote the line you are most interested in and ask a question”.

I would like to try to have a conversation after pouring over existing sentences that are not in conversational form on Scrapbox in phase mode.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="/nishio/nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What kind of “Scrapbox” is this “Scrapbox”?
Unlike chat, it’s a bulleted wiki, so users seem to be in a different state of mind when they write.

<li>Is there anything else you can tell us about this “Scrapbox”?
Especially with wikis that are co-edited by multiple people, there are cases where the text that flows into the wiki is written by multiple people.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="/nishio/nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What is it that you value?
This is an unanticipated use, but that’s why I want to find some potentially interesting and useful use for it.

I already have a few bullet points written down, and I’d like to move the conversation forward by having the bot ask questions about them.

<li>What do you hope will happen regarding this “Scrapbox”?
If Scrapbox had an API that could be written to programmatically, it would be possible to realize a bot that would ask questions on its own without a human being having to activate it…
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="/nishio/nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What needs to happen to “Scrapbox” for that to happen?
API needs to be added
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="/nishio/nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>As for “Scrapbox,” can it do that?
I don’t think I can.

Beyond the barriers that make participation difficult from the perspective of autonomous bots.

On a server in Nota. Oh, and if you sign up for on-premise, it might come in the form of a Docker image and you can put it on the server of your choice.

I can’t open a browser and write (and I was thinking, after writing all this, if I look at the communication when I paste one line and imitate it, can I write one line like I want to do this time?)

<li>What do you hope will happen regarding this “bot”?
Now, the user can only write in the open text area and cannot decide where to write himself. While in a bulleted wiki, I am only able to add a flat line at the end. It would be nice to be able to write anywhere at any time, just like a human being.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="/nishio/nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What needs to happen to the “bot” for that to happen?
So the world (Scrapbox) side is inconvenienced but not changed, so the self (bot) side needs to change? I wonder if it will be possible to achieve cursor movement on the browser, or if it will be possible to mimic network communication when adding a line to an arbitrary position.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="/nishio/nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>As for “bots,” can they do it?
Both seem like a lot of work, but it could be done.

<li>The keywords selected are “Scrapbox”, “bot”, and “handicap”, so it looks like we’ve narrowed it down to the core of the topic.
