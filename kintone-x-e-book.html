<ul>
<li>
<p>Assume a situation where you have a lot of cut, scanned, and OCR’d PDFs (hereafter referred to as e-books)</p>
<ul>
<li>Tutsumi First of all, this scanning is an act of reproduction, so I’m not sure if it is a legal reproduction or not.
<ul>
<li>I forgot to explain, but I assume that you have legally reproduced it in the following way.</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>(Reproduction for private use)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Article 30 A work that is the subject of a copyright (hereinafter in this Subsection referred to simply as “work”) may be used for personal or family use or other similarly limited use (hereinafter referred to as “private use”). Article 30 A work (hereinafter in this Subsection simply referred to as “work”) that is the subject matter of a copyright (hereinafter in this Subsection simply referred to as “work”) may be reproduced by the person who uses it for personal use or use within the family or other similarly limited scope (hereinafter referred to as “personal use”), except in the following cases (2) A work (hereinafter in this subsection referred to simply as “work”) may be reproduced by the person who uses it for the purpose of personal or family use or other similar limited use (hereinafter referred to as “private use”), except in the following cases</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Naturally, the following systems must not be used for business purposes within the company organization</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>How about uploading this cut and scanned PDF to a web service, e.g. kintone</p>
<ul>
<li>If there’s only one person watching, it should be legal.
<ul>
<li>It’s no different than having it in Dropbox or Evernote.</li>
<li>No infringement of the right to make transmittable since it is not transmitted “to the public.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What if it was more than one person?
<ul>
<li>I think this is also legal if you set the field access rights.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>tsk tsk: did you check the definition of “public” properly?</p>
<ul>
<li>Definition of Public:.
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>The term “public” as used in this Act shall include specific and numerous persons.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>One person is fine, but it’s not clear how many to many when there’s more than one.</li>
<li>Specific but applicable to the public.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>User benefits obtained even when used by one person</p>
<ul>
<li>A permalink on the Internet for the e-books I own.</li>
<li>You can write comments about the book.
<ul>
<li>Not only for cut and scanned e-books, but also for papers, etc.</li>
<li><img src="https://gyazo.com/39bbf7e2d964d6c1eea0caaa932f22d8/thumb/1000" alt="image"/></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cross-searchable from the entire e-book you own.
<ul>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What happens if more than one person uses this?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If it is shared only among a limited number of friends, can it be argued that it is not a public transmission because it is “personal or within the home or other similarly limited area”?</p>
<ul>
<li>Supporting discussion of the extent to which private copying is possible
<ul>
<li>Tut-tut “Public” is a clearly defined concept, so it’s not a good idea to use other arguments to support your argument.
<ul>
<li>If it is specific but numerous, it constitutes a public transmission and is therefore “use of a copyrighted work,” and permission must be obtained.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[There is no such thing as private copying to begin with.

</li>
<li>The author occupies the right to reproduce.” This reproduction is the “use” of the work.</li>
<li>Use and exploit are two different words.
<ul>
<li>The use of the word “use” means any use other than use.</li>
<li>Hear” is not included in use, so it is a use.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The clause states that reproduction for private use is permitted only if the user himself is the one who is making the reproduction.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>One advantage is that it supports intellectual communication mediated by books, such as finding a friend who has the same book and getting excited about it, or searching for a book you are planning to buy and asking someone who has it what they think of it.</p>
<ul>
<li>If it’s legal, I want to do it without hesitation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Solutions that take advantage of kintone’s functionality</p>
<ul>
<li>KINTONE can specify access rights for each field with the default functionality.</li>
<li>In other words, “Attachment fields can only be viewed by the record creator” can be set.</li>
<li>This way, no matter how many people use it, it’s not a public transmission, right?</li>
<li><img src="https://gyazo.com/25131a1fd1baa7a0040f7eca1a559194/thumb/1000" alt="image"/></li>
</ul>
<p>More aggressive use</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For example, if we add a field “friends with special access” and grant them viewing privileges, they will be able to view and search, but is this private in scope?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is legal for the administrator to download and analyze this “PDF that only the uploader can see” for the purpose of, for example, keyword extraction to suggest related books, or to allow everyone to search inside, according to the following provisions.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote>

<p>Article 47-7 A work shall be subject to information analysis (meaning the extraction, comparison, classification and other statistical analysis of information pertaining to language, sound, images and other elements constituting said information from a large number of works and other large amounts of information.

<blockquote>
<p>Article 47-6 In response to a request from the public, a transmission source identification code (meaning a character, number, symbol, or other code to identify the transmission source of an automatic public transmission; the same shall apply hereinafter in this Article) pertaining to information made available for transmission may be used to identify the source of the transmission. The same shall apply hereinafter in this Article.) Article 4 Any person who engages in the search for and provision of the results of the search (including those who engage in a part of said business, and limited to those who collect, organize and provide transmittable information in accordance with the standards specified by Cabinet Order) of information made available for transmission shall not be liable for any loss or damage arising from said search and provision of the results of said search and provision.

Hereinafter in this Article referred to as “record for providing search results”) recorded on said recording medium, together with the provision of the transmission source identification code pertaining to the information enabling the transmission.  (2) A person may make a record of the search results (including a duplicate of a work) However, when the copyright holder becomes aware that the making transmittable of a work pertaining to said record for providing search results infringes the copyright (in the case of making transmittable made outside of Japan, if it had been made in Japan, it would have infringed the copyright), he/she may thereafter refrain from automatic public transmission (including making transmittable) of said record for providing search results using said record for providing search results.

</li>
<li>Based on the statement “If the title is included in a work, there is no need to write ‘a work and its title,’ and therefore the title is not a work”, the company argues that “if the title is included in a work, there is no need to write ‘a work and its title.</li>
