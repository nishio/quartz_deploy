<ul>
<li>We had a junior high school student do a work experience, and we had him do SF prototyping with ChatGPT, and it turned out to be a much better presentation than we had imagined.
<ul>
<li>It sounded like the plan was to have them research the technology that would be available in 2030 and make a presentation about it.</li>
<li>Since it‚Äôs the future, I thought <a href="./SF-Prototyping" class="internal alias" data-slug="SF-Prototyping">SF Prototyping</a> would be a good idea, so I just threw it in on the spur of the moment.</li>
<li>Good story!<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon" alt="/villagepump/nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>
<ul>
<li>I‚Äôm hungry for case studies of experiences.</li>
<li>I‚Äôd appreciate it if you could share what you did and how it went to the extent possible.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I know it‚Äôs a bit bland.<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/mtane0412/icon" alt="/villagepump/mtane0412.icon" height="19.5"/>
<ul>
<li>If you want a novel body or a prompt or something, let me know again!
<ul>
<li>I have permission to share it at organized events, but I would like to ask permission again just in case!<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/mtane0412/icon" alt="/villagepump/mtane0412.icon" height="19.5"/></li>
<li>I‚Äôm more interested in how you communicated the idea of ‚Äútrying SF prototyping‚Äù to middle school students to get them to understand the idea, rather than the prompt or the novel itself!<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon" alt="/villagepump/nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>
<ul>
<li>The core part is to convey your message to others, and I told them that I see potential in SF prototyping because people are more likely to understand a story in this regard.<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/mtane0412/icon" alt="/villagepump/mtane0412.icon" height="19.5"/>
<ul>
<li>I thought the middle schoolers were mainly analyzing and researching, too, so maybe this is where it stung.</li>
<li>I also told him that imagination is necessary when thinking about the future and visions, and the novel seemed to be very powerful in this regard!</li>
<li>We have not yet tried this method, so our ‚Äújob‚Äù during the work experience was to find out how this method actually works!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It was work experience, so no matter how I tried to explain it in words, I had to do it anyway, but I think I understood it by actually doing it!
<ul>
<li>We experienced together how the output of ChatGPT further stimulated our imagination while creating a novel together.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Day 1
<ul>
<li>Ask the participants to look at Yoichi Ochiai‚Äôs <a href="./Technology-Future-Timeline" class="internal alias" data-slug="Technology-Future-Timeline">Technology Future Timeline</a> and choose one of the technologies that will be realized in 2030 (when today‚Äôs junior high school students are 21 years old and thinking about finding a job).</li>
<li>Ask them to research and summarize the technology with a focus on the Internet.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2nd day
<ul>
<li>The participants are asked to present what they have put together, but at this time, they are asked to make it into the form of a science fiction novel (science fiction prototyping).</li>
<li>Have ChatGPT (3.5) used in writing a science fiction novel</li>
<li>Output door picture with midjourney (<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/mtane0412/icon" alt="/villagepump/mtane0412.icon" height="19.5"/> sudden thought)</li>
<li>After presenting the content of the novel, have them also do a presentation on what they wanted to convey and what points they focused on.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The child who chose the moon base
<ul>
<li>The Day 1 summary was simply a summary of what kind of technology was available, and the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù was missing.
<ul>
<li>If we had used the usual method, it would have been a presentation by a junior high school student saying, ‚ÄúThis is what I researched, and that‚Äôs it. The end of the presentation‚Äù.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>At the stage of turning it into a novel on the second day, I needed to have a perspective of what the future would be like and what I wanted to convey.</li>
<li>I honestly thought this subject would be difficult.
<ul>
<li>Space expansion isn‚Äôt going to solve anything right now.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Middle school students were giving orders for unknown elements to be discovered by young scientists for various applications.
<ul>
<li>Furthermore, the first order only featured one person, so we brought in a veteran scientist to oppose this one.</li>
<li>This is a good example of ‚Äúbasic research‚Äù versus ‚Äúselection and concentration‚Äù in today‚Äôs world! I was like ‚ÄúOh my God!
<ul>
<li>The characters were portrayed in vivid drama, so it went right to my head.
<ul>
<li>I see<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/Âü∫Á¥†/icon" alt="/villagepump/Âü∫Á¥†.icon" height="19.5"/></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The middle school students came up with the ideas here, and the text was arranged by ChatGPT.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>AI selected child
<ul>
<li>The summary of the first day was quite high-level, and divided into two categories: jobs that will disappear with AI and jobs that will continue to exist.
<ul>
<li>I have a different opinion on this viewpoint itself.<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/mtane0412/icon" alt="/villagepump/mtane0412.icon" height="19.5"/></li>
<li>Not only did it bring them out, but it also led to what elements are common to each of them.</li>
<li>He even made the final argument that AI and people should coexist.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The second day‚Äôs novel, on the other hand, didn‚Äôt sink in as quickly as it should have.
<ul>
<li>It felt like an analytical thing turned straight into a novel, not much of a story.</li>
<li>I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs appropriate to say this in a work experience, but I tried to convey this point.</li>
<li>Then they rewrote it as fast as they could and it was a lot better.
<ul>
<li>I thought it was the power of AI.</li>
<li>interesting<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/nishio/icon" alt="/villagepump/nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>
<ul>
<li>The cycle of showing it to people, receiving their reactions, and improving it is turning!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Benefits felt from SF prototyping
<ul>
<li>Perhaps if presented as is, it would have been out of the range of junior high school students.
<ul>
<li>What we researched <span>‚Üí</span> What we found out <span>‚Üí</span> Impressions</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I felt that the novel format structurally incorporates the perspective of what is the message you want to convey and what the future should be like.
<ul>
<li>That‚Äôs where I could use my creativity.</li>
<li>AI further assisted it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I got the impression that what he wanted to convey to those listening to his presentation was also easily conveyed.
<ul>
<li>Stories are easier for people to understand.</li>
