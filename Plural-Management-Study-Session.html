<blockquote>
<p>We introduce Plural Management, a model for partially replacing hierarchical organizational authority with plural mechanisms allowing networked authority. Participants earn influence by anticipating and fulfilling organizational priorities and harness this influence to set priorities and validate contributions, fostering a dynamic, merit-based power structure. This approach, which we illustrate with the example of open-source software development, emphasizes valued contributions and diligence without requiring hierarchical choke points, thereby enhancing participation and allowing adaptive collective intelligence.</p>

<p>I‚Äôll nail it first.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes there are sterile debates about democratic systems in the world.</li>
<li>One of the reasons for this is that the following two types of people fight
<ul>
<li>A: Idiots who stop to think that ‚Äúbeing democratic is good‚Äù.</li>
<li>B: An asshole who just mentions the word ‚Äúdemocratic‚Äù in a conversation and assumes that you are a ‚Äútype A‚Äù asshole.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We must properly delve into what exactly the ‚Äúdemocratic system‚Äù is and what its purpose is and how it works.
<ul>
<li>Basically, any system is not ‚Äúuniversal magic‚Äù or a ‚Äúsilver bullet‚Äù and must be used in the right places.</li>
<li>The ‚Äúcurrent democratic system‚Äù is also malfunctioning in many situations.</li>
<li>A ‚Äúnew democratic system‚Äù is proposed to solve the problem</li>
<li>If you don‚Äôt know the system, you can‚Äôt come up with ‚Äúlet‚Äôs use it for this‚Äù for the appropriate subject.</li>

<p>Members of the organization can dynamically earn management credits through their work. Issue boards allow members to prioritize assignments through quadratic funding (<a href="./Quadratic-Funding" class="internal alias" data-slug="Quadratic-Funding">Quadratic Funding</a>) using credits. These credits are paid to members who work on these issues through contributions. Payments are made only after a second vote taken by other members who consume management credits to exercise their authority.</p>

<p>The classic alternative to this dichotomy is the use of markets (Hamel and Zanini, 2020; Coase, 1995). Yet, a critical role of firms is to create internal partially public goods and take advantage of increasing returns, which markets generally do not efficiently supply (Samuelson, 1995). Thus Groves (1973) and Groves and Loeb (1979) argued for using public goods mechanisms to organize pro- duction inside firms in lieu of hierarchies and markets. Yet, these mechanisms have typically been seen as cum- bersome and impractical.</p>

<p>Traditional hierarchical management systems, the backbone of modern corporate and organizational struc- ture, are predicated on power dynamics that traditionally follow a top-down approach (Drucker, 1974). Employees within such systems often climb the ladder by demon- strating value through hard work and alignment of their actions with a culture articulated by those in authority, a practice sometimes pejoratively caricatured as ‚Äòsucking up.‚Äô Detractors note that such practices can suppress cre- ativity, reduce employee engagement, create bottlenecks in decision-making, and often result in the underutiliza- tion of talent at lower levels of the organization.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At the other end of the spectrum, the absence of struc- tured management has its pitfalls, such as the ‚Äòtyranny of structurelessness,‚Äô where the lack of clear roles and re- sponsibilities can lead to chaos, inefficiency, and the emer- gence of informal and often unaccountable power struc- tures (Friedman, 2007). Striking a balance between overly rigid hierarchies and a complete lack of structure has been a complex endeavor. Several innovative manage- ment approaches have been proposed and widely imple- mented, such as flat organizations that minimize hierar- chical levels (Laloux, 2014), holacracy which distributes decision-making through overlapping teams (Robertson, 2015), and sociocracy which emphasizes consensus in gov- ernance (Buck and Endenburg, 2012). Each of these mod- els seeks to address the limitations of traditional hierarchy by promoting a more egalitarian and adaptive approach (Rothschild and Whitt, 1986). None, however, has the mechanistic clarity of either markets or hierarchies, ar- guably undermining their capacity to avoid the challenges Freeman highlights. We aim to harness advances in plural mechanism design to fill this lacuna.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, the lack of structured management also has its problems. For example, there is a situation of ‚Äútyranny without structure,‚Äù where the lack of clear roles and responsibilities leads to the emergence of informal power structures that are confusing, inefficient, and often irresponsible (Friedman, 2007). Striking a balance between overly rigid hierarchies and a total lack of structure is a complex challenge. Several innovative management approaches have been proposed and widely implemented. Examples include flat organizations that minimize hierarchical levels (Lalou, 2014), holacracy that distributes decision-making through overlapping teams (Robertson, 2015), and sociocracy that emphasizes consensus in governance (Buck and Endenburg, 2012). These models seek to address the limitations of traditional hierarchies by promoting a more egalitarian and adaptive approach (Rothschild and Witt, 1986). However, none of these approaches have a clear mechanism, such as markets or hierarchies, and their ability to avoid the challenges highlighted by Freeman is questionable. We seek to fill this void by leveraging advances in multi-mechanism design.

<p>In the proposed model, management credits serve as a dynamic ledger of contribution and influence. Internal, non-financial credits are initially assigned based on role or past contributions and are subsequently earned through direct contributions and triage. The expenditure of these credits in setting priorities and approving contributions is governed by a quadratic cost function, steering towards optimal public goods outcomes by avoiding excessive dom- inance of those with greater authority. Prediction markets are used to encourage those with limited authority to act as ‚Äúanalysts‚Äù, helping authorities triage contributions, and dynamic evolution of priorities on unaddressed tasks act as a sort of dynamic auction-like bounty system to en- sure tasks are addressed in a timely and well-prioritized manner.</p>

<p>Consider an organization that has an issue board where all major tasks or initiatives to be completed are listed (similar to open-source issue trackers as in subsection 2.1). Individuals with management credits can set priorities for an organization by assigning a priority value for an is- sue using credits. The priority on an issue is not simply the sum of the credits assigned to it, but instead may be matched by a matching pool (provided by individuals in their role as administrators) consistent with practical ap- plications of Quadratic Funding, as we will discuss further below.</p>

<ul>
<li>In a crude way, individuals who have a lot of credits can donate to increase the incentive for others to participate.
<ul>
<li>Because we‚Äôve been talking about use cases in the enterprise so far, ‚ÄúIncentives to participate?‚Äù that might be an ‚Äúincentive?</li>
<li>For example, if we consider a situation where engineers are trying to solve a problem that a non-engineering department in the company is having that could be solved by writing a little JS, an individual who thinks ‚Äúit‚Äôs good that such an activity is taking place‚Äù can put his/her token into the matching pool. They can put their tokens into the matching pool.</li>
<li>This would increase the payment of tokens to the engineers who actually write the code and solve the problem, which would be an incentive for more participation.</li>
<li>If engineers participate more, there will be more incentive on the part of issue owners to register their issues on the issue board.</li>
<li>The resulting token donation of ‚ÄúI like that this kind of activity is taking place‚Äù encourages other members to participate in the activity itself.</li>

<p>An individual may perform the role of a worker and provide a solution to an issue in the form of a contri- bution.

<p>Once a contribution has been made, it goes to a con- tribution vote. In this vote individuals can expend man- agement credits to vote if the contribution should be ap- proved or not.

<p>In addition to casting a vote, each individual can choose to ‚Äòbet‚Äô the number of credits they used to vote that their prediction of acceptance or rejection will suc- ceed. If correct, this bet will pay out double the credits used to vote. This vote prediction allows individuals to be rewarded for correctly anticipating the desires of the full community. We introduce a prediction subsidy parameter that can be set by administrators for each contribution vote that reduces the cost of voting and increases the re- ward from betting. By default, voting and then betting on this is strictly unprofitable. However, in many cases, ad- ministrators may wish to increase the subsidy to allow op- portunities for individuals who can anticipate community needs to gain authority. For example, providing a subsidy can incent individuals with fewer management credits to participate in votes that would otherwise be costly, which means that a larger crowd of individuals is performing due diligence on contributions. If many contributions are being made in a large organization, this is akin to reward- ing individuals for administrative processing that ‚Äútriages‚Äù contributions and thus surfaces important divisive votes to managers with more authority.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In this model, in addition to voting, an individual may choose to ‚Äúwager‚Äù the number of credits used to vote on whether his or her acceptance or rejection prediction will be successful. If the prediction is correct, this wager yields a payout of twice the credits used to vote. This voting prediction allows individuals to be rewarded for accurately predicting the desires of the community as a whole. We introduce a prediction aid parameter that is set for each contributed vote by the administrator to reduce the cost of voting and increase the reward from the wager. By default, voting and wagering is strictly non-profitable. However, in many cases, administrators may wish to increase subsidies to provide an opportunity to empower individuals who can predict community needs. For example, providing subsidies can encourage individuals with less administrative credit to participate in voting that would otherwise be costly. This means that more people are paying appropriate attention to contributions, and if many contributions are made within a larger organization, this can be seen as a reward for individuals for administrative processing to ‚Äúscreen contributions‚Äù and highlight critical juncture votes to more empowered administrators.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>In other words, by the mechanism of the prediction market, if, for example, ‚Äúa project that one committer X is making a decision to accept or not‚Äù is transferred to this system, the result will be the same because others will vote the same as X‚Äôs evaluation if they think that X‚Äôs decision is reliable.</li>
<li>Personally, I feel that there would be an incentive to delay my vote until X votes.
<ul>
<li>When X was making decisions alone, the entire burden of decision-making was always concentrated on X.</li>
<li>When there is no longer a guarantee that X will always rate, will those with strong opinions vote to rate first?

<ul>
<li>
<p>I‚Äôm talking about the ‚Äúdemocratic values‚Äù that say everyone should participate in open source projects, and anyone can make a pull request, but eventually that management will be a dictatorship (or oligarchy) by a ‚Äú[benevolent dictator.</p>

<li>
<p>Whether the results it produces are bad or not is beside the point. Personally, I can‚Äôt dismiss the feeling that ‚ÄúIn the OSS, dictatorships by competent individuals have performed well, right? Maybe dictatorships by competent individuals are the best way to govern after all.‚Äù</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Of course, the fact that ‚Äúthere have been a number of OSSs that have done well by dictatorships‚Äù does not logically negate the ‚Äúpossibility of better governance by democratic mechanisms‚Äù</p>

<p>By offering greater clarity and empowerment to con- tributors, plural management can help founders to slowly transition management authority to those who prove their merit by contributing code, diligence, or support in a way that is measurably valuable to the community in question. Since the model is lightweight, iterative, and self-directed, it is well suited for commonly used agile environments and tools of the kinds often used by open-source communities. Consider the most popular open-source hosting plat- form GitHub. For any given project there is a reposi- tory of code, set up by an administrator or maintainer, within which any contributor is listed as a member. At- tached to this repository is an Issues section (extremely similar to our described issue board, just without any ex- plicit priorities assigned numerically). Anyone on GitHub can create a contribution on this board in the form of a ‚Äòpull request‚Äô (shorted to PR) that aims to address one or more outstanding issues. After the pull request is dis- cussed in a comment section, the community can decide whether to accept or reject it, and in turn, maintainers can add or ‚Äòmerge‚Äô the contribution into the repository. Using Plural Management, with minimal changes to workflows, any maintainer or administrator could set priority tags on GitHub, associate a price in credits, and in turn drive more contributions to their repository as a first step in eventually improving their bus factor from the low average of two (Metabase, 2022).</p>

For example, if someone were to be appointed to the social media manager for a project, an issue stating the need for a social media manager could be made, and when someone is to be appointed, a simple PR adding the name of the person to the community notes could be made by the new social media manager. If the community votes to approve this new role, the social media manager will now be rewarded with additional management credits reflect- ing their new role.</p>

<p>A tangible example of the use of plural management be- yond the usual open-source context is the plurality book, an open, git-based experiment around collective author- ship. Initiated by E. Glen Weyl and Audrey Tang, 50 members around the world have contributed to the book, Plurality: The Future of Collaborative Technology and Democracy without any expectation of reward. Using the plural management protocol, this project seeks to tran- sition ownership over future improvements to the book incrementally, including updates to content, translations, and further links to relevant materials. Over time, those who have contributed most meaningfully will therefore help guide not just the book but the field of research itself.</p>

<p>The plural management protocol describes two key ac- tivities: a prioritization subsystem and an approval sub- system. These subsystems exist jointly and constitute a broader organizational structure, where individuals earn management credits that can be used to perform actions. These credits can be initially distributed when an organi- zation is established and are naturally distributed to new members as they participate (in effect lessening the con- trol of founders over time). The credit can be stored in any simple ledger that can be amended over time when interacting with the protocol.</p>

<p>There are many additional considerations surrounding the sharing, control, and visibility of these management credits.

Should individuals be able to directly send management credits to another member (this would ease the setup challenges for new members and allow old mem- bers to gracefully leave, but could also reduce meritocracy and result in off-the-books gambling or scheming)? We re- turn to these open questions in our conclusion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Each member can spend a portion of their management credits on priority setting. This is done dynamically and members can add or withdraw credits from each issue at any time. For each member who sets a priority to an issue by assigning Pi credits, we sum over the square roots of their priority and take the total square to find the total issue priority. Hence, the quadratic priority for issue j is (equation) . This is exactly akin to quadratic funding, from which we further draw on the idea of a matching fund. A matching fund is generated from credits used in voting or further increased by a large man- agement credit holder (such as an early founding member) who may choose to assign funds as a matching pool to dis- tribute to new contributors as incentives to join.</p>

<li>There is much debate about the extent to which ensuring diversity based on individual attributes is beneficial to actual performance, but the idea is that it is difficult to take action to increase diversity in thinking, which is difficult to measure, so why not first strengthen diversity, which is easier to measure?

<p>(5) Currently, individuals cannot directly send man- agement credits to another member, as a way to prevent off-book trading of management credit which could result in a market price for management authority. This helps prevent the financialization of management authority, and makes certain behaviors difficult or impossible. For example, if a founder wants to bring in a new member quickly to provide authority, they cannot directly send credits and must conduct elaborate PR rewards for this contributor that are voted on by the whole community (in some sense also preventing nepotism). Further, if a member wants to leave, they cannot transfer credits to others quickly aside from putting all credits in a matching fund. Future re- search into the implications of enabling direct trading is important before incorporating it.</p>

An analysis of how participants in prurient management vote with and without forecasting opportunities can help us understand what limits should be placed on the rewards from this activity.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>I think the introduction of a prediction market is a new point in this proposal.</li>
<li>Whether it works or not has not yet been verified by practical experiments.</li>
<li>Probably implemented first in Gov4git (since one of the authors is Gov4git).</li>

<p>Plural management is a protocol for bridging between the desired properties of rigid management hierarchies and flat decentralized organizations, allowing for the dynamic al- location of management authority based on longitudinal contributions of individuals to outcomes and management decisions. Through the adjustment of a voting-prediction discount parameter, administrators can reward new or low credit-holding members of a community for their work in performing due diligence of new contributions in line with the expected standards or higher-authority mem- bers. This management approach, which uses quadratic funding to solicit preference from a broad base of partici- pants, creates a closed credit system with no external mon- etary value, that can only be exercised within the project. While this design of a management protocol raises open questions about implementation choices and net outcomes on organizations‚Äô productivity, it can built using standard software design practices and fits naturally into the work- flow of open-source projects. In total, this model of plural management could present a dynamic scalable approach to distributing authority and rewarding participation across projects of any scope, mission, or size.</p>

<p>Prural Management is a protocol for bridging the gap between a rigid management hierarchy and the desirable characteristics of a flat, decentralized organization, allowing for the dynamic assignment of management authority based on individual performance and long-term contributions to management decisions. Through the adjustment of the vote projection discount parameter, managers can reward new members and low credit ownership members for their work in conducting appropriate research on new contributions in line with expected criteria and high authority members. This management approach uses secondary financing to solicit preferences from a wide range of participants, creating a closed credit system with no external monetary value that can only be exercised within the project. The design of this management protocol raises unresolved issues regarding implementation choices and overall outcomes for organizational productivity, but can be built using standard software design practices and fits naturally into the workflow of an open source project. In sum, this prurient management model has the potential to present a dynamic and scalable approach to distributing authority and rewarding participation in projects of any size, mission, or size.</p>

However, it does not seem to be a common number (different people give different weights to different themes and to different pairs of people who vote on them). I agree with the idea of quantification, but I feel that it would be tough to do it in monetary terms.</p>
