<ul>
<li>
<p>I wrote this because I wanted someone other than myself to use it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why is the link so important to Scrapbox?”</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="./Knowledge-Collaboration-Tools" class="internal alias" data-slug="Knowledge-Collaboration-Tools">Knowledge Collaboration Tools</a></li>
<li>It’s not like any other information organizer I’ve ever seen.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write a book in Scrapbox</p>
<ul>
<li>PRIVATE PROJECT by myself and my editor.</li>
<li>Create an index page, zlip the content, then chop it up into pages, then back into one.</li>
<li>Runs faster than Evernote
<ul>
<li>Especially mobile</li>
<li>You can add a little bit of writing in your spare time.</li>
<li>Drawing allows you to quickly draw diagrams.</li>
<li>Sending manuscripts to editors via email has a “please read” feel to it, and Dropbox also notifies them of changes.</li>
<li>Perfect for those who don’t need rich text but want links.</li>
<li>With Evernote, it’s completely rich text, so it’s heavy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I want to manipulate outlines.
<ul>
<li>The book is designed to flow from chapter to chapter, so it is necessary to look at the flow of headings while looking at the text
<ul>
<li>Ability to display only the strongest and second most emphasized symbols</li>
<li>It’s hard without that kind of thing because it’s 10,000 to 20,000 words when it comes to chapter units.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>WorkFlowy was also used in conjunction</li>
<li>More suitable for writing than outliner</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Would I recommend it? I wouldn’t.</li>
<li>Scrapbox Triangle
<ul>
<li>Easy to use, no knowledge required.</li>
<li>The knowledge required to use it expands rapidly.
<ul>
<li>JS customization, etc.</li>
<li>The difficult question is how much to include in the book.</li>
<li>There are two ways of functioning staircase method and tutorial method.
<ul>
<li>Scrapbox is easy and the beginning of yesterday’s staircase is boring.
<ul>
<li><a href="./Predictive-links-and-unforeseen-missing-links" class="internal alias" data-slug="Predictive-links-and-unforeseen-missing-links">Predictive links and unforeseen missing links</a></li>
<li>Prediction links do not occur</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After a brief introduction to the function in chapter 1, we talked about philosophy in chapter 2.
<ul>
<li>Advanced content is explained in Chapter 4.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>Scrapbox is easy to explain because it’s not “Mac and Windows versions” or anything like that.</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s hard to explain the difference between the paid and free versions.

<li>What’s Scprapbox?”</li>
<li>Mr. Kurashita didn’t decide that this was the right answer, either.</li>
<li>However, I don’t know how to explain it to a new user…</li>
<li>Explanation in about 30 seconds</li>
<li>Motivation to start using Scrapbox, why, pivot at some point.</li>
<li>Points of inspiration and awakening</li>
<li>Mr. Kurashita.
<ul>
<li>I learned about it from someone’s blog.</li>
<li>card-type</li>
<li>Similar to Evernote’s card view.</li>
<li>I was looking at it from an Evernote perspective.</li>
<li>That makes it feel underfunctional.</li>
<li>The amount of information that can be automatically captured is small.</li>
<li>I read shokai’s philosophy on Scrapbox and thought, “Really?</li>
<li>It’s not a warehouse of dead texts.”</li>
<li>There is no point in taking it in automatically.</li>
<li>It makes sense to write your own description and add your own links.</li>
<li>I don’t think I would have understood it if I first read the philosophy of shokai, I understood it because I used it for a while before I read it.</li>
<li>The writing itself shows the philosophy</li>
<li>The normal way of writing would be long, blog-like sentences.</li>
<li>That page embodies how it should be used.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mr. Minatogawa.
<ul>
<li>The trigger was Dr. Masui, a newsletter in Nico Nico Douga (which one?).</li>
<li>Description of the person who created the HTML
<ul>
<li>CERN</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Introduced Scrapbox by saying, “I think this is what the developer wanted to create.</li>
<li>CERN</li>
<li>A large research organization with hundreds of researchers coming and going</li>
<li>Paper is hard to find.</li>
<li>Inefficient if you don’t know which papers are connected to which papers.</li>
<li>That’s where the Web was born.</li>
<li>It was designed to achieve a common human resource library, a kind of big library.</li>
<li>In a word: “external memory.”</li>
<li>As for my usage.</li>
<li>There are various ways to use it depending on the project, but the main way is to just keep adding ideas before I forget them.</li>
<li>If you put in a letter with a link to something that your brain can’t come up with, at some point that link will connect, and that will be the story of the book.</li>
<li>Interesting chemical reactions.</li>
<li>What are some of the points that woke you up? →That there is no submit button, it is saved and published as soon as you write it.
<ul>
<li>When I try to write a blog post, I get a bit of a chip on my shoulder.</li>
<li>I feel like I’ve had a good night’s sleep.</li>
<li>The good thing about Scrapbox is that there is no such stress at all.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I started using it as external storage too.
<ul>
<li>I’m looking at a lot of different companies, maybe 10.</li>
<li>You can write directly on site or continue at home</li>
<li>A timeline, noting which clients you went to and what you did on this day</li>
<li>I realized, “If all you want to do is keep track, just use the notes app on your iPhone”, not so much, but really external memory.</li>
<li>Marketing, branding, engineering training, mixed, but can be connected.</li>
<li>The connection is that I’ve been doing this in my head.</li>
<li>I’m putting the findings from Client A in Scrapbox, which will connect with the rest of the company’s.</li>
<li>I dare you to use internal memory for what you need to imprint on yourself.</li>
<li>Use of external and internal memory</li>
<li>I feel like I’m using my head differently.</li>

<li>I originally made paper copi and Evernote got me.</li>
<li>Frankly, I thought I’d done it all and was bored.</li>
<li>I have no interest in Evernote and have never used it.</li>
<li>It was interesting because Mr. Masui used Gyazz.</li>
<li>I thought this should be easier to use.</li>
<li>As you rewrite the title, the file name keeps changing.</li>
<li>You can forget about the existence of files.</li>
<li>Scrapbox also keeps changing the URL as you rewrite the title.</li>
<li>35, but the first time I worked in the business, I worked remotely, I paid people remotely, in 2002.</li>
<li>We can’t do without Scrapbox-like tools.</li>
<li>Difficult with Skype, etc.</li>
<li>I was looking for something that would allow me to write out a lot of information, and that would allow me to communicate with a large amount of people at the same time. Then I saw Gyazz, and I knew this was it.</li>
<li>Stories for customers</li>
<li>Shokai is an inhabitant of a “this is the way it’s supposed to be” kind of world.</li>
<li>Even within our company, we had a hard time spreading the word.</li>
<li>I’m amazed that customers understand.</li>
<li>I think it’s kind of obvious that they don’t understand it, like they do with comics and books.
Mr. Kurashita.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It’s not the same as saying, “There’s an aha.</li>
<li>Don’t teach too much.</li>
<li>Better to be discovered.</li>
</ul>

I’ll tell you the path to some extent, but not the goal.
Get a foot in the door in the direction you think would be good.</p>
<p>It’s not a good idea to teach them too much about how to use it, though.
I think the easy or fun part is the common denominator.</p>
<p>Cartoon, the main character is a sloppy student, Scrapbox makes it easy.
I think I can tell you the emotional part.</p>
<p>I see a Tweet with the keyword “Scrapbox” in it.</p>
<p>The number of Tweets with the keyword “Scrapbox” in them has been increasing a lot in the past few weeks.
He talks about his experiences right up to the top. Lots of “fun,” etc.</p>
<p>I think the speed of response to my actions of linking and writing UserScripts is the reason why I enjoy it so much.</p>
<p>Fast is important.</p>
<p>It’s fun when you discover something, or when you find a link in a place you never thought of.</p>
<p>Some use it with their team, some use it on their own, but I feel like I’m discovering a new me when I use it on my own.</p>
<p>I enjoy looking at other people’s Scrapboxes.
Customized to the gory details.</p>
<p>Know that others have ideas that you don’t know about.</p>
<p>Next Theme
Who would you like to use it? When should we use it?</p>
<p>I think it can be used for any kind of work.
The threshold is low.
I’ve been struggling with the issue of not being able to use Markdown, but this one is more open to various users.</p>
<p>Not all sentences are converted to HTML, so if you’re looking for speed and output without thinking about h2 and h3, Scrapbox is a better choice.
I’m doing a live feed here on Scrapbox! it’s interesting to see the cursor appear and see more and more edits being made.</p>
<ul>
<li>I think the world is going to become a <a href="./remote-work" class="internal alias" data-slug="remote-work">remote work</a> or <a href="./autonomous-decentralized" class="internal alias" data-slug="autonomous-decentralized">autonomous decentralized</a> way of working.
It is strange that young engineers are also learning new ways of doing things in the lab, but when they enter the company, they are stuck in a mold.
I want young people to have an open-source, out-of-company experience that contributes to the world.</li>

<p>Useful for process improvement.
There is an assumption that there must be a set tool, a way of doing things, a formula.
Unravel it and think by yourself or in a team.
Scrapbox is useful as a tool for unraveling it.
Think and write your own ideas, others will see them, and generalizations will be made by them.
This is due to the origins of the Wiki.
They can be used to develop the habit of thinking.</p>
<p>When I write a letter, I think, “Okay, I’m going to write,” and then I stop writing.
Head to Scrapbox and let your brain hang out.
Even with markdown, it’s like, “I’m going to write a headline now.
Brain Direct UI
Scrapbox is saying that what you think is dripping out of you, and it is one step away from that.</p>
<p>If it’s a site that says, “We have to do it right,” I say, “Why don’t we do some sloppy sharing?”
If there’s a word you don’t understand, make it a link and someone will write it down for you.
If I can’t write if I don’t know everything, I can’t go on.
Even if you don’t know what you’re doing, just write it down anyway.
Imagine a team member as a direct brain connection.</p>
<p>Multiple people’s brains are directly connected.</p>
<p>Q: How do you guys view and use projects? With Evernote you can move notes around and put them in other notebooks, but what do you do with Scrapbox? A wall of files or a wall of folders.
A: If it is for your own use alone, it is better to put everything in one place without separating anything. Divide by members. Divide by who you want to share this information with.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There is one private for myself and the rest is mostly public.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All in one on the inside.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don’t think of subdivisions too much.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can start with one.
A: Things like moving notes between Evernote can be copied by exporting them in JSON and importing them into another project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are considering searching for multiple projects, and the parts are being assembled bit by bit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It would be nice to be able to export only those projects that meet the criteria</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A: RakuSai-san also only divides his personal notebooks by person, and he writes his personal notebooks in the company’s projects. If no one links to your personal notebook, you will have your personal notebook in a corner of the company’s project.</p>
<ul>
<li>I really want to share the same Scrapbox with the shareholders.</li>
<li>It is more useful to link from as wide a range as possible</li>
</ul>
<p>A: People ask about departments and information control, but if you do that, the form of intellectual property depends on the structure of the organization.</p>
<ul>
<li>We can discuss this information when it actually comes out.</li>
<li>There’s no right answer, so it’s done in one first, then gradually divided as needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite the ability to share information widely, the pre-IT practice of communicating in sequence remains.
There are many people out there who already work in a way that doesn’t drag out those practices, and it’s actually more efficient.</p>
<p>Q: If you had 20 people, you could do it, but if you had 10,000 people, you wouldn’t be able to do it.
A: At most 30 people, I don’t know if I can do it.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I’m optimistic because I don’t recommend starting with a large group out of the blue and it won’t work, and expanding what has worked with a small group is more likely to work.
A: There are companies with 200 people doing this, Masui Lab has 90 (not all active)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You need a sense of trust, what you write can be erased, and there will be an editing war, so</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wikipedia in Japan has 15 editorial board members, none of them full time, and that’s how it runs, so if you have a problem with a large company, just put an editorial board member on it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Manga’s Scrapbox also hangs a tree with icons instead of the editor directly erasing it.</p>
<ul>
<li>operation procedures</li>
<li>Basically, don’t erase, and a clean copy is a separate notebook.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>We will need to foster a culture.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>shio I use it in seminars and the only rule is “never turn it off.”</p>
<ul>
<li>When I get feedback on my writing, I want to erase it and fix it, but instead of erasing it, I duplicate it and fix it there.</li>
<li>One project if the members are the same, one project if the objectives are the same, originally five separate projects for five different seminars, but eventually merged into one.</li>
<li>I want the ability to put a specific tag on every page, and I put it in manually at that time.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>It’s sterile to go back and re-connect pages that were split up in Scrapbox to make a book, and it’s sterile to delete links,</li>
<li>Maybe selling it in Scrapbox format would be a good idea.</li>
<li>Strange to publish a paper book and then an e-book.</li>
<li>We should sell the Scrapbox version first, get feedback and fix it, and then release the paper.</li>
<li>Books are a finitization tool, and if you keep inflating them in Scrapbox, you’re going against the direction of publishing, which is finite and trying to cut them out.</li>

<p>Don’t import mechanically, it’s no fun when a lot of different text is plugged in with no links attached.

<p>salt (i.e. sodium chloride)
The links below will be in the order in which the tags appeared.
The first card that comes up first never comes up again, so if you put “tags that apply to a lot of things” first, the later tags will be shadowed. So write from the narrowest tag.</p>
