<li>To use a <a href="./crane-game" class="internal alias" data-slug="crane-game">crane game</a> analogy, it is as if you had only been able to move the crane left and right, but then you realized there was a button to move it in the depth direction, and you thought, “If I press this button, it will move back and forth!

- I first wrote an application that can play chords as a way to study [[musical (music) theory]].
    - After that, he learned [[electronic construction]] and made [[RakuChord]] as hardware.
    - In the process, I realized that playing the piano with both hands (if you play it in a kindergarten teacher way) doesn't seem to be a superb skill.
        - There might have been a sense of [New doors opened.
        - I figured this out recently.<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/villagepump/基素/icon" alt="/villagepump/基素.icon" height="19.5"/>
    - And [[InstaChord]] is having fun.
- An example of how learning electronics in the first place opened new doors.
    - [[AHA experience]] I remember that term too.
    - This one is more like a light &quot;awareness&quot;?
    - Since I bought a [[3D printer]], I think I've started to look at plastic products as something to be made.
        - I don't have any knowledge of [[Injection Molding]] yet, though,

- There is a sense in which the skill of illustration does not grow linearly with the amount of practice, but rather in steps in the extreme, and this is something that others have often said
    - Various people express it in terms of being able to do that when they become &quot;aware.&quot;
    - Could it be something close?

<ul>
<li>Let’s compare going from not being able to draw at all to being able to generate pictures with AI to going from not being able to play an instrument at all to being able to play it with InstaChord.</li>
<li>Ah, I see, so there is an increase in the axis of “something to play” as well as the perception that a song is “something to listen to” (observation).
<ul>
<li>Level 1: The
<ul>
<li>Recognizes a song as “something to listen to” and does not recognize the possibility of playing it himself</li>
<li>Recognizes illustrations as “something to look at” and does not recognize the possibility that he/she produces them</li>
<li>This phase is “no”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Level 2: The
<ul>
<li>Recognize the possibility of playing a song and begin to think about which one to play</li>
<li>Realizing that I can generate illustrations, I start thinking about what to generate.</li>
<li>This phase is the “can-do” phase.</li>
<li><a href="./&quot;Every-song-you've-ever-heard-is-eligible-for-performance&quot;" class="internal alias" data-slug="&quot;Every-song-you've-ever-heard-is-eligible-for-performance&quot;">“Every song you’ve ever heard is eligible for performance&quot;</a>&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Level 3: The
<ul>
<li>Try to play some and recognize what is easy and what is difficult.
<ul>
<li>You’ll be able to understand things like, “Oh, I see, this song modulates twice.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Generate some illustrations and be able to recognize what is easy and what is difficult</li>
<li>Maybe it’s not appropriate to summarize this place with an illustration and a narrative.
<ul>
<li>The former creates from zero, the latter reproduces what is already there with good physical manipulation.</li>
<li>They share the “moving” aspect, but not the “making” aspect.</li>
<li>The “making” in music is going to be composing.</li>
<li>Maybe when you get used to insta-chords and gain some experience in “playing a song while watching the chord progression”, a physical sense of “chord progression” will be created in your brain</li>
<li>If you can do that, you can try to do the chord progression on your own as you see fit.</li>
<li>And if you play the notes in the chord at random, you can create a melody that sounds like it, and it becomes an experience of “I’m not very good at this, but I was able to generate it from scratch”.</li>
<li>Is this phase equivalent to the “I put in a prompt and a picture came up” phase for the image generation AI?</li>
<li>AI image generation feels “from scratch” but in reality, just as AI learns a lot from the past, does music generation need to learn a lot from the past first?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>InstaChord also said that there is “creating from zero”.
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>That feeling of being able to create a song as you are playing along… (With InstaChord), you can do that… Many people say that as they play with InstaChord, they gradually come to understand how a song is made. You can notice that after this chord, it often becomes this chord.</p>

<li>I used to think, “There are difficult songs and easy songs; let’s find the easy ones and play them.”</li>
<li>Now the definition of “difficult” has changed.
<ul>
<li>Because I can now convert difficult chord notation into easy chord notation in my brain in no time.</li>
<li>I’ve come to believe that Yuichi was right when he said, “You don’t have to choose a beginner’s chord chart, just ignore the sevens and sus4s.</li>
<li>On the other hand, the swap in 3~ should not be omitted and the b in 7b should not be omitted
<ul>
<li>I can now make this decision without any particular thought.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I sometimes get confused because I don’t know “when to play” maybe I haven’t developed much of a sense of “beat” yet I learned the concept of stroke patterns after writing this.
<ul>
<li>Play the upstroke.”
<ul>
<li>When it took me so long to switch fingers, I couldn’t play upstrokes because I didn’t have enough time.</li>
<li>The concept of “beat” is clearer if you are always jerking around, not just jangling the chord changes.</li>
<li>The chord chart is distorted in time because the lyrics are written in Chinese characters and there are many moras in one character, and there are sections of rests with no lyrics.
<ul>
<li>We’re naturally expected to compensate for that in our brains.</li>
<li>Lyrics and chords are not enough information.</li>
<li>When you’re doing jaka-jaka, you’ll know, “Oh, that’s next,” or “That’s the pattern, 3 jaka-jaka, 1 jaka-jaka, 4 jaka-jaka.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The combination of “brain conversion to easy chords” and “acquisition of the concept of time signatures” has changed the way I used to be able to play only easy songs with video plus: I am now able to play songs that are easy to play and have a video plus.

<li>I was wondering if my perception was correct, so I looked it up and found just the right sheet music.</li>
<li>Words like “wind, chest, beat, me, smile” are split.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you’re like me, who hasn’t developed the skills to feel the measure, you’ll recognize this melody in the following blocks
<ul>
<li><img src="https://gyazo.com/505502a01fcc2ede9053c887d2f3d016/thumb/1000" alt="image"/></li>
<li>If you play a chord at the head of this block, it will be out of alignment or out of number.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I felt like I took a step forward last time with “Play the Upstroke,” but today I took another step forward.
<ul>
<li>Better forget about the melody and lyrics.</li>
<li>It’s the melody on top of the chords, not the chords on top of the melody.</li>
<li>Chords are more important than lyrics or word breaks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I wrote about a month ago: I recognized when I started doing it that there are often cases where the “timing of the play” does not match the word boundaries in the first place.”
<ul>
<li>I needed <a href="./be-well-spoken" class="internal alias" data-slug="be-well-spoken">be well-spoken</a> time to be able to articulate this realization.</li>

- > Merleau-Ponty, on the other hand, believed that the movement orientation of the subjective body provides an understanding of the world
- > Heidegger considered tools to be separate from the human body, whereas Merleau-Ponty considered the human body itself to be a tool, and even when artifacts are used as tools, they are subjectively perceived as an extension of the body

- ❌increase resolution.
- ⭕There seems to be an emphasis on “moving it”.
- This is a case where our understanding of the world is being promoted not by “increasing cognitive resolution” but by “improving our skills in using tools.”
- I wrote “Merleau-Ponty-like vocabulary,” but I didn’t need to distinguish between Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty on this one.
- Can we say “phenomenological vocabulary?” Would that be the opposite, or would Husserl get mixed up and become something different…</p>

- This is a description of the process of increasing cognitive resolution in the process of playing the game “Guess my current location by looking at Google Street View”
- I had the feeling that it was a little different than what we’re talking about here.
- Perhaps it’s the difference between “increasing cognitive resolution” and “improving skill in using tools.”</p>
