<p>I’ve been studying macroeconomics because I don’t know what the news about “negative real GDP” means, but are all of the following propositions true?</p>
<p>Situation: Mr. A produces three apples, sells them to Mr. B, and then buys processed apples from Mr. B to eat.</p>
<p>1: If Mr. B buys 3 apples for 3 yen and processes them and sells them for 2 yen each, Mr. B’s production is 3</p>
<p>2: If Mr. B buys 3 apples for 3 yen, processes them and sells 2 apples for 2 yen each, and consumes the remaining one at home, production is 3 and consumption is 2.</p>
<p>3: If Mr. B buys 3 apples for 3 yen, processes them and prices them at 2 yen each, but cannot sell them at all and they all rot, production is 3 and consumption is 6.</p>
<p>4: If the government takes a tax of 2 and invests it in something, this is an import 2 (because that 2 is not passed on to any of the citizens, so it has gone overseas).</p>
<p>5: If the government takes a tax of 2 and makes it ODA or something, this is also import 2.</p>
<p>6: If the government takes a tax of 2 and spreads it around as a farm subsidy to Mr. A, production + 2 (because if Mr. A does not consume it, his savings will increase by 2).</p>
<p>If all of this is true, then I think it makes sense. On the other hand, I also think that there is a significant deviation from what is generally imagined from the terminology.

Nishio Hirokazu As for 6, if we make the rule “subsidies are offset against taxes”, does it make sense without accepting the rule “subsidies are also considered production”?

Nishio Hirokazu
Nishio Hirokazu Ohkubo Kohei That still seems odd. If that is the case, I should consider that the production took place when the processed goods were sold, not when they were processed, so it would make sense if I assume “production 2 (number sold x profit), consumption 1 (raw material cost of goods consumed at home)” in case 2, and “production 0, consumption 3 (raw material cost)” in case 3.

Jun Harada
Jun Harada My knowledge of GDP has stopped since high school, but since GDP only includes final goods, I think that in case 1, the production is 6. The amount of money obtained by the vendor who sold apples to Mr. B should be treated as an intermediate good, and intermediate goods should not be included in GDP.

Jun Harada
Harada, Atsushi As for 2, I didn’t know this until I googled it, but I heard that farmers’ own consumption is included in GDP, so I think this also makes the production 6. If Mr. B produced 6, sold 4 in the market and consumed 2 at home, it would be neat as an explanation of 3-sided equivalence since production and expenditure are equal. I think this would be a cleaner explanation of the 3-sided equivalence.</p>
<p>But I’m not sure how to handle rotten cases and such after 3. ・・・・

Nishio Hirokazu I understand that the interesting point of Rickard’s theory of comparative advantage is that even an absolutely inferior country can benefit from trade, but I am suspicious of the assumptions that “an absolutely inferior country must have items in which it has a comparative advantage” and “the cost of trade is zero,” and I think that if the If the cost of trade is somewhat high, the inequality is inverted and “trade 0 is the maximum value”, and how high the cost is inverted depends on the size of comparative advantage, right?

Masaki Iwata Ah, I didn’t see the middle of the discussion. Farmer’s (Mr. A) own consumption contributes to GDP, but processor’s (Mr. B/individual) own consumption (rotten, not sold) is completed in Mr. B’s P/L. Is this not a good idea?

Masaki Iwata For Mr. A, if he wants apples, he has to buy them in the market. If there is a liquid market with a price of 1 yen per apple, then the production of apples contributes to real GDP.

Masaki Iwata
Masaki Iwata The first problem is that the fact that the government is also a market participant is missing (government spending should appear in the GDP calculation formula), and the second is that in 4. the reason for “(because)” and “because~” is not set as a proposition, since the 2 is not passed on to any of the citizens, which means it went abroad. The reason for “because” is not set as a proposition.
Then the government is not a participant (it can only take the same actions as the private sector), and the “yen” is credited without the presence of the government. Then, the action of ‘I studied macroeconomics because I don’t understand the meaning of news like “real GDP is negative”’ is itself an attempt at a false understanding.

Yu Kobayashi Sorry, Japan, not only real GDP growth rate, but also nominal GDP growth rate is negative…

Kobayashi Yuu GDP deflator, if it grows positive, it will be the first time in 17 years (not ‘95, not ‘97?)

Masaki Iwata The reason why I’ve been rambling against 4.~ from the beginning is because I think the proposition itself is wrong for the original ~ to be understood. I think that is the reason.

Nishio Hirokazu Well, I don’t mind if you conclude that I tried to understand incorrectly, but what I wanted to do was to “understand what GDP is”, and for that purpose, I made a country with only two citizens and examined what could be included in each element of the identity equation. I then started to consider what could go into each element of the identity equation, and I came up with a number of propositions, “If my understanding is correct, then this proposition is true, but it doesn’t feel right. I listed them here.</p>
<p>Therefore, I have no objection to the statement in 4, “When government expenditures are recorded, they can only be considered as imports,” whereas “acts that are not imports, such as currency repurchases, are not recorded as government expenditures.</p>
<p>So what about deflators and the difference between nominal and real is off-topic, right? Or am I still wrong in my understanding that this is off-topic?

Yu Kobayashi Sorry, I am only talking about the “news that real GDP growth is negative” deflator.</p>
