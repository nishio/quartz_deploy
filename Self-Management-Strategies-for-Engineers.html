Miura City Agricultural Cooperative Distribution System Algorithm
- We have developed an algorithm that automatically creates a distribution plan for which items and how many cases to load on each truck when delivering shipments from each farmer to about 50 markets.
- I supervised a course on machine learning for PyQ.</p>
<p>Be Proud PyQ machine learning course supervision
- PyQ is a service that allows users to learn Python by actually working with it, through a system that allows Python programs to be written and executed in a browser. <a href="https://pyq.jp/" class="external">https://pyq.jp/<svg aria-hidden="true" class="external-icon" style="max-width:0.8em;max-height:0.8em;" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><path d="M320 0H288V64h32 82.7L201.4 265.4 178.7 288 224 333.3l22.6-22.6L448 109.3V192v32h64V192 32 0H480 320zM32 32H0V64 480v32H32 456h32V480 352 320H424v32 96H64V96h96 32V32H160 32z"></path></svg></a></p>

A major turning point 7 years ago 7</p>
<p>2011-04 to 2014-09
As a working graduate student
Entered professional degree program in Technology Management, Graduate School of Innovation Management, Tokyo Institute of Technology ‚Üí Completed</p>
<p>There was a big change in the way I think and how I see things.</p>

Want to know what I learned?  8</p>
<p>What did you learn in the Technology Management major?
There were requests for details, but I didn‚Äôt know how to tell them.</p>
<p>It is difficult to convey what I myself learned over three and a half years in a limited time of about one hour.
‚ÜíThis time, I‚Äôll focus on the ‚Äúfirst step‚Äù and explain it.</p>

Objective 9</p>
<p>-To improve your life in the future.
Not today, not tomorrow, but 510 years from now.</p>
<p>-Sow the seeds for this now. Focusing on the first step of action.</p>
<p>-Follow-up for those who want to learn more.</p>

How follow-up works 10</p>
<p>I‚Äôve created a group on Facebook called ‚ÄúSelf-Management Strategies for 180324 Engineers‚Äù.</p>
<p>I will post the lecture slides to this group later.
Answer questions, post additional information, etc.</p>

Anxiety about new things 13</p>
<pre><code>- I'm [[anxious]] to do [[something new]].
- I'm anxious because I'm unclear about what I'll get out of it.
- Mental strain because it's unclear how long it will take to do something new.

Basic strategy:<a href="./Limit-the-amount-of-loss" class="internal alias" data-slug="Limit-the-amount-of-loss">Limit the amount of loss</a> 14
- When making investments with uncertain outcomes, limit losses to a small amount.
- Bad example: I want to understand everything in this book.
- Good example: Let‚Äôs look at this book for 15 minutes first.
- Good example: I‚Äôll listen to an hour-long lecture first.
- ‚ÜíEven if it‚Äôs a failure, you‚Äôve just lost an hour.

Why small groups?„ÄÄ 37</p>
<p>-The words ‚Äúgroup‚Äù and ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù tend to conjure up images of something big with lots of people.
-This is because larger groups are easier to observe.
-There are disadvantages to being large.</p>
<p>*There are many small ones, but most of them are not in your field of vision</p>

<ul>
<li>If the group is large, the words and <a href="./the-situation" class="internal alias" data-slug="the-situation">the situation</a> are disconnected</li>

Why create your own group?</p>
<ul>
<li>‚ÄúIf someone has created a group that
46 - The chances of someone creating a group that you can join and that is not too large are very small.
-If it‚Äôs in the form of a private group, you won‚Äôt even know it exists.

You can start out quietly and informally.</p>
<p>-There are too many hurdles if you try to build a solid organization from the beginning.
-Start small!
-Starting quietly can act as a gate in itself.</p>

To make it a mutually beneficial community 48</p>
<p>-You have to be the ‚Äúgiver‚Äù first.
-Give &amp; Take starts with Give.
-Begin by telling other members what you saw and heard at this event.

-Set a reminder trigger.</p>

Why multiple groups? „ÄÄ50</p>
<p>-Belonging to multiple groups with different members makes you a pipe for knowledge to flow through.
-Knowledge, unlike water, can accumulate in intermediaries.</p>

Value creation through intermediation 51</p>
<p>-Transmit the knowledge you gained in Group A to Group B, who is hungry for that knowledge.
People in Group B will be happy = customer value creation
-By gaining practical experience in mediation, you will develop the ability to determine what is worth mediation.
-Mediating on information that can be obtained by Googling does not lead to value.</p>

<p>But this word ‚Äúexpertise‚Äù is vague, and it‚Äôs not clear to what level we should go.

Why triggers? „ÄÄ60</p>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes we understand value after time has passed*.</li>

<li>When you first start a group, you are very excited and active, but it usually lasts three days.</li>
</ul>
<p>That‚Äôs why I remind them when time has passed and they have forgotten.</p>
<p>*When people ask me right after completing MOT, ‚ÄúHow did it help you? I replied, ‚ÄúIt broadened my horizons‚Äù and ‚ÄúI made different decisions based on the book I wrote.

<li>When you have a lot of free riders</li>
<li>Create a new ‚Äúenrichment group‚Äù with Givers based on one year of activity</li>
<li>If there are more people who think the enriched group is better, the activity will take place in that group, and the old group will disappear naturally.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unofficial groups are not only cheaper to create, but also cheaper to terminate because they can disappear spontaneously.</p>
