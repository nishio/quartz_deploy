<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/gpt/icon" alt="gpt.icon" height="19.5"/>This series of tweets criticizes certain misconceptions and prejudices against the study of the life and dress of common people in history and folklore. The author points out that those who feel that there is a lack of research on the clothing and lives of peasants and common people in the past are actually complaining about inadequate research methods and based on their own ignorance and prejudices. In particular, they address the false belief that only poor peasants wear certain clothes and the prejudices that arise in the process of seeking historical realism.</li>

<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>It is interesting to point out that “when you look for something and think you can’t find it, it may be because you are making an unconscious assumption,” and “you may be overlaying a systemic other-blame assumption that it is not recorded, even though that personal assumption is a factor in your not being able to find it.”</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/gpt/icon" alt="gpt.icon" height="19.5"/>Based on Nishio’s impressions, sakana6634’s tweet series can be summarized as follows.
<ul>
<li>sakana6634 strongly refutes common misconceptions and prejudices about “invisible” dress and culture in history. In particular, in response to complaints that information about the dress of poor peasants is not recorded in history, sakana6634 points out that such information does in fact exist and can be found in abundance, especially in the field of folklore. sakana6634 criticizes the assumption held by some people that “there are special clothes that only poor peasants wear, argues that it is based on unjustified prejudice.</li>
<li>sakana6634 also criticizes culturally biased people who believe they are good and intellectually curious, but in reality have a distorted view of reality due to their lack of knowledge and understanding. They stress the importance of moving away from simplistic fantasies by developing a deeper understanding of history and culture, embracing diversity, and increasing resolution.</li>
<li>The series reveals and critiques prejudices based on shallow understanding of culture and history and false assumptions based on that understanding. sakana6634 calls for deeper knowledge and understanding and emphasizes that modern academia should play a role in removing prejudices and providing a broader perspective.</li>

If you look in the folklore section, not Japanese history, you’ll find plenty. Even if it’s just the wild clothes, there are more variations with subtle differences in shape and names from region to region than you can handle. To add to that, even peasants have their own culture of sundresses.</p>

The ugliness of the assumption that only the peasants who don’t eat and drink would have clothes to wear. What’s with that “If you’re not a poor person wearing rags, you’re not real, but you can’t find it. The realism I’m looking for is buried in the darkness of history. It’s too grotesque.</p>

However, I also think that one of the proper roles of modern academia is to lead us one step further from there, to provide a broad perspective based on facts and to remove prejudice. No, I hope so.</p>

It’s not the darkness of history that hides it (although I’m sure that’s the case), it’s the fog of the person’s own ignorance that covers their vision.</p>

I think there are still some things that are the same today. There are many local government archives that have donated so many folk tools and stray clothes that they are having trouble preserving them, and they are struggling to find ways to preserve them.</p>

Because for someone who says that so easily, how many people can think of themselves and the connection between a while ago, a long time ago, a little while ago, a long time ago, a long time ago, a long time ago, a very long time ago, a very long time ago, and a very long time … or less?</p>
