<p>I used to take notes a lot, but I learned how to use sticky notes in class. If we write on sticky notes and divide them into groups, we can combine them within those groups to generate ideas that we never would have thought of.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>One additional point is that notebooks also have a good point. It can be stored for a long time.</li>
<li>One of the advantages of sticky notes compared to notebooks is the listability. In a notebook, for example, you cannot compare fragments of ideas written 10 pages apart side by side.</li>
<li>It is best to take advantage of the best aspects of each method.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Science is not only about controlled experiments, but also about the laws and facts of the world in general, and rather than science being unable to cope, philosophy can be seen as a different perspective from science, a proof that facts alone cannot be true.</p>

<ul>
<li>Well, it looks like I have created a misunderstanding because I spoke verbatim during the Q&amp;A about something that was not on the slides. My apologies.</li>
<li>The tone of the message is as if it is refuting me, but I don’t see any particular discrepancy between the content of the argument and my argument.</li>
<li>As for “only facts can’t be the truth,” I’m like, “Yeah, right.”
<ul>
<li>To put a finer point on it, “In what sense do you use the word ‘fact’ and ‘truth’ interchangeably?” I would like to ask the question back…</li>

<li>Slides here <a href="./What-is-correctness" class="internal alias" data-slug="What-is-correctness">What is correctness?</a>.

<blockquote>
<p>I thought that by differentiating experience (3 dimensions) into charts (2 dimensions) and words (1 dimension), I could communicate to others, and what was communicated to me could be executed by integrating in the opposite direction.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Interesting metaphor.</li>
<li>I think it would be more convincing if you think about what exactly those “derivatives” and “integrals” are.
<ul>
<li>You could involve your own specific experiences.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no room for opinions. Maybe you should put in some content that the instructor hasn’t been able to fill in and put it out in the form of a question.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Maybe!</li>
<li>But others have many opinions.
<ul>
<li>So the observational facts tell us that “the interpretation of ‘no room for opinion’ is wrong.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I think there is a lot of room for opinion without deliberately planting it.</li>

<p>I want to find something that I can continue throughout my college life.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Hmmm, do I have to keep going on and on?</li>
<li>I think that college students have a much narrower perspective than working adults because they have no experience in the business world. In such a situation, what you decide “this is it! is just a matter of what seems to be the best in a narrow viewpoint.</li>
<li>If you find something that looks better, you can switch right away.</li>

<p>If you ask a question online, a lot of people will answer it.</p>

<ul>
<li>I doubt it. I think you are overlooking what the people who answer are acting in exchange for.
<ul>
<li>For example, “A sense of being needed in society” that by answering a question, “I am <a href="./providing-value-to-society" class="internal alias" data-slug="providing-value-to-society">providing value to society</a> by answering the question.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If my lecture this time was uploaded as a 90-minute video on YouTube, would people watch it and give feedback like they did this time? Wouldn’t they have come to listen because they thought their attendance would lead to credit, and wouldn’t they have submitted an answer sheet because submission was a requirement for credit?</li>
<li>Also, when seeking an answer to a question, the questioner needs to be clear about what he or she wants to ask.

<p>I think the risks of practicing what you’re interested in are high.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Then, on the other hand, what’s less risky?</li>
<li>Is it less risky if your life is one of diligently doing “things I’m not interested in but those around me tell me to do?”
<ul>
<li>That may have been true in the days when once you joined a company, you were secure until retirement.</li>
<li>But we live in a time when you risk being restructured in middle age.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I’ll do what everyone around me tells me to do! If you were in charge of human resources, would you hire a middle-aged person like that?</li>
<li>If his current knowledge is very useful for the company’s business, that’s one thing, but if not, I’d rather have someone younger and stronger for the same salary.</li>
<li>That means those middle-aged people will only be paid less than the young people.</li>

<li>The phenomenon is true.</li>
<li>But to think that it is “ruined” is an interpretation.</li>
<li>The reason why many people use computers instead of writing by hand to maintain their “ability to write Kanji characters” is that many people value “convenience” more than “ability to write Kanji characters”.</li>

<p>To contain the flood of information on Twitter and other sites, each individual should be able to set keywords and interests and only see information related to those keywords and interests.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Actually, it’s partially achieved through keyword searches, hashtags, etc.</li>
<li>I think the only thing that Twitter’s search functionality achieves at this point is to display Tweets that contain certain keywords.</li>
<li>On the other hand, how to express “interest” and how to determine “related to it” are a little less powerful than keywords alone.
<ul>
<li>For example, I am interested in “unexplored”, but if I use this as a keyword, I get hits for “unexplored peak”, “unexplored summons”, “unexplored confirmation”, and other unrelated things.</li>

<p>Philosophy of receiving from others and philosophy of really doing it oneself</p>

<ul>
<li>I found the distinction between “received philosophy” and “philosophy that does its own thing” very helpful.
<ul>
<li>When I said “philosophy is important,” I implicitly envisioned a “philosophy that does its own thing.</li>
<li>I know it’s a received wisdom, but Plato wrote that “essential knowledge must produce itself,” and I agree with him!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Conversely, “received philosophy” that talks about what is written in books with an attitude of “it was written in a book, so it is right” is “<a href="./Rootless-Knowledge" class="internal alias" data-slug="Rootless-Knowledge">Rootless Knowledge</a>” and “<a href="./Cherry-blossom-branches-taken" class="internal alias" data-slug="Cherry-blossom-branches-taken">Cherry blossom branches taken</a>” and therefore has no “usefulness” because it does not lead to useful application, A silly act. I connected with the slides here and there!</li>
<li>Similar to the cutoffs of “received philosophy” and “philosophy that does its own thing”: “history of philosophy” and “practice of philosophy”.
<ul>
<li>There is philosophy as a discipline that collects and categorizes historical facts about who and what, and there is philosophy as a practice that we constantly ask ourselves.</li>

<li>I think you are right. This presentation of mine has also been made by trying to communicate.</li>

<p>The idea that failure is an opportunity to learn is interesting. However, repeated failures are mentally taxing. How can we overcome this?</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>It’s hard when you think, “This should not fail,” and you fail, but if you try it with the mindset, “I don’t know if it will work, but I’ll give it a try,” then even if it fails, you’ll be like, “Oh, I guess it didn’t work.</li>

<li>I hit the random button and found this, which made the train ride more enjoyable than looking at Twitter.</li>
<li>This page is a “big chunk” so it might be better to break it up.</li>
<li>Immediately after an event, it is more beneficial to have a coherent set of items related to the event; however, over time, cohesiveness becomes less meaningful and more fluid when broken down.</li>
<li>A large tree called lecture material is grown for the event, and after the event, the tree stops renewing itself and becomes a dead, fallen tree. The tree then decomposes and becomes rich decaying soil.</li>
