<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>I’ve read Merleau-Ponty’s commentary on Husserl’s phenomenology and want to see how well I can explain it without looking at it.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>What kind of “hussar” is this “hussar”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>A philosopher famous for his phenomenology, who, according to Merleau-Ponty, introduced the discussion of language, which was not so mainstream in the philosophical genealogy.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>What kind of “Merlot Ponti” is this “Merlot Ponti”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Merleau-Ponty is also famous for his philosophy on language, the contrast between institutionalized language and the language that is being born.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>Is there anything else you can tell us about this “Merlo Ponti”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Now I want to talk about Hussar.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>What is it that you value?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>I would like to verify the extent of my understanding of Husserl by answering the question.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>Is there anything else you can tell us about this “hussar”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Early on, I was interested in the unifying nature of language, but later I came to believe that language becomes a unified system when people try to use it to express themselves.

<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>I hope that now that I know a lot about Husserl, I’ll read Heidegger next.

<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>As for “hussar,” can it be done?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>I’d like to do a test to see if I can answer that question.

<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>Yes, sir.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Let’s see, if we consider that language is the accidental result of various past events, it is incomprehensible that it should be a unified system of meaning, it would be chaos!

<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>And so, instead, we approach a unified system by trying to express what people want to say about themselves.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>Hussar.”
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Well, I can’t explain it anymore, I don’t understand much.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>Hussar.”

<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>I wanted to verify how much I understood, but it was still hard to explain without seeing anything.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>What kind of “verify” is that “verify”?

<li>Where is this “hussar” located?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>That’s before Merleau-Ponty.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>What is it that you value?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>You’re talking about why I’m trying to understand Husserl, because Eugene Gendlin’s ideas were very much in line with my practical purpose, which was to focus on how to put the unverbalized into language, so I was studying that, and I was studying the Merleau-Ponty text that he was introducing me to. I ordered and read the Merleau-Ponty text that he was referring to, and it was a commentary on Husserl and then a development of Husserl’s commentary, so I decided to experiment with that as a test bed and try to use Kozaneba to go through the process of reading and understanding a difficult book.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>What does that “hussar” look like?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>It’s a source, I don’t know if it’s useful per se, Eugene Gendlin and Merleau-Ponty both developed a lot of things based on Husserl’s story, so it would be good to know where it’s Husserl-derived.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>Where does this “hussar” come from?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>I was interested in it because Eugene Gendlin introduced it, and I originally went through my “phenomenology” thinking “hmm, I don’t know, it doesn’t seem useful for my life”, but I’m finding out that it’s actually quite relevant in regards to my current interests.

<li>How do you know this “Merlo Ponti”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Maybe you should read the rest of the article and figure out Merleau-Ponty’s argument.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>What is the relationship between this “Merleau-Ponty” and “Hussar”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>Yes, so far I don’t see the difference between Merleau-Ponty’s and Husserl’s arguments, I don’t think they are equal, but what is the difference?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/kei/icon" alt="/nishio/kei.icon" height="19.5"/>Is that “Merleau-Ponty” the same as “Hussar”? Is it the same as “Merleau-Ponty”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="/nishio/human.icon" height="19.5"/>They should be different, but I can’t tell the difference right now.

<li>Where does this “Merlo Ponti” come from?
