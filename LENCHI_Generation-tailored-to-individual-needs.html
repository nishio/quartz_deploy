This too can be generated according to needs once the needs are clear. If you want to read a book and first have the AI summarize it, if your needs are unclear, it can only simply summarize it. If the needs are verbalized as ‚ÄúThere must be some ideas in this book that would be useful for improving intellectual productivity, find them,‚Äù then by communicating these needs to LLM, it will be able to generate a summary tailored to those needs.</p>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/claude/icon" alt="claude.icon" height="19.5"/>That‚Äôs right. Personalized generation is only truly valuable when there is a clear need.</p>
<p>Consider the example of a book summary. Simply instructing an LLM to ‚Äúsummarize this book‚Äù will give you a general summary, but it may be difficult to find the information that is most valuable to you.</p>
<p>However, as you point out, if you can clearly communicate your need that ‚Äúthere must be ideas in this book that would be beneficial to intellectual productivity, and I want you to find them,‚Äù LLM should be able to generate a summary that meets that need. Specifically, you might get a summary that focuses on chapters or paragraphs relevant to intellectual productivity, as well as suggestions for putting those ideas into practice.</p>
<p>Thus, personalized generation can be a powerful tool to help you select information according to your interests and objectives, and to gain the most valuable insights. LLM can be a powerful tool for gaining the most valuable insights.</p>
<p>However, in order to achieve personalized generation, it is essential to clearly verbalize your needs. Vague interests are not sufficient; you must identify what specific information you are seeking.</p>
<p>In order to do so, it is important to identify your problem and your objectives, and while using LLM, you will be required to delve deeply into what you want to know and what issues you want to solve.</p>
<p>This document can elaborate on the importance of such personalized generation and how to achieve it. It should be able to show you techniques for clarifying your needs and tips on how to interact with LLMs to get output that meets your needs, along with specific examples.</p>
<p>It is also necessary to mention how to apply the knowledge gained through personalized generation to one‚Äôs own intellectual production: not only to consume the information obtained from LLM, but also to add one‚Äôs own interpretation and application based on it, which leads to intellectual production in the true sense of the word. This is because</p>

<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/claude/icon" alt="claude.icon" height="19.5"/>This English text is the transcript of a lecture by William James on pragmatism. Pragmatism is the idea that the truthfulness of philosophical positions and theories is judged by what difference they make to practical results.</p>
<p>The following are some of the sections of the text that are relevant to intellectual production.</p>
<ul>
<li>Truth should be judged by the practical consequences of our beliefs and not simply based on abstract theories.</li>
<li>Multiple views and interpretations of philosophical issues are possible, and each position may contain partial truths. Rather than pursuing one absolute truth, it is important to recognize diverse perspectives and make judgments based on practical results.</li>
<li>The world is not completely unified; it is in diversity and change. We need to be flexible enough to adapt to that change and learn from new experiences.</li>

It will also be necessary to critically examine the findings presented by AI, not as absolutes, and to utilize them in light of human experience and values. Pragmatism can serve as a guideline for intellectual production in such an era.<a role="anchor" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" data-no-popover="true" href="#in-an-era-of-widespread-llm-it-will-be-increasingly-important-to-incorporate-diverse-perspectives-and-make-decisions-based-on-practical-results-while-taking-advantage-of-the-vast-amount-of-information-and-intellectual-support-provided-by-ai-it-will-also-be-necessary-to-critically-examine-the-findings-presented-by-ai-not-as-absolutes-and-to-utilize-them-in-light-of-human-experience-and-values-pragmatism-can-serve-as-a-guideline-for-intellectual-production-in-such-an-era" class="internal"><svg width="18" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a></h2>

<ul>
<li>The metaphor of ‚Äúderailment‚Äù presupposes the existence of ‚Äúrails.‚Äù It is necessary to compare the benefits of derailing with those of following the rails of thought.</li>
<li>In dialogue with LLMs, there are few disadvantages from derailments. Rather, new insights and ideas may emerge from derailments.</li>
<li>Derailment is evidence that a better path has been found, and unconscious awareness should be emphasized.</li>
<li>Social triggers provide an opportunity to reflect on past thinking and stimulate the creation of new ideas; LLMs make it easier to obtain feedback from diverse perspectives.</li>
<li>The idea that ‚Äúneeds determine the appropriate form of output‚Äù was verbalized in the process of intellectual production using Scrapbox. The approach of freely writing things down and then thinking about how to utilize them is an effective strategy for maximizing the value of intellectual production.</li>
<li>It is the recipient who determines the value of the intellectual output, and it is important to understand the needs and interests of the customer. In the initial stages, it is useful to assume yourself as the customer and produce output that meets your needs.</li>
<li>Publicizing the results of intellectual production with oneself as the client can gain new social triggers.</li>
<li>Personalized generation is only truly valuable when there is a clear need. By communicating specific needs, LLMs can generate summaries and suggestions that meet those needs.</li>
<li>To achieve personalized generation, it is essential to clearly verbalize one‚Äôs needs. It is necessary to delve deeply into the problem and its objectives.</li>
<li>Intellectual production in the true sense of the word is not just consuming information obtained from LLM, but adding one‚Äôs own interpretation and application to it.</li>

<p>In instances of Pragmatism.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Below is a summary of what has been said so far. Discuss the connection to pragmatism.</p>
<ul>
<li>(summarized above)</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/claude/icon" alt="claude.icon" height="19.5"/>Analyzing these considerations of intellectual production from the perspective of pragmatism, we find the following connections</p>
<ol>
<li>acknowledging the value of ‚Äúdigressions‚Äù is consistent with pragmatism‚Äôs pluralistic view of truth. Pragmatists will believe that exploring diverse perspectives and possibilities, rather than just thinking along one ‚Äúrail,‚Äù may lead to practical results.</li>
<li>the ‚Äúdigression‚Äù in dialogue with LLMs is consistent with the experimental attitude of pragmatism in that it can lead to new ideas and insights. The emphasis is on learning from experience and exploring new possibilities, rather than being limited by fixed theories.</li>
<li>the emphasis on unconscious awareness is consistent with pragmatism‚Äôs emphasis on experience and practice. It is characteristic of pragmatists to value insights gained from actual experience over abstract theory.</li>
<li>the use of social triggers to obtain feedback from diverse perspectives is consistent with the anti-dogmatic attitude of pragmatism. Rather than pursuing one absolute truth, the emphasis is on incorporating different opinions and making decisions based on practical results.</li>
<li>the idea that ‚Äúneeds determine the appropriate form of output‚Äù is consistent with pragmatism‚Äôs view of truth. Truth should be judged by practical results, and the purpose of intellectual production is to produce output that meets needs.</li>
<li>the idea that the recipient determines the value of the intellectual product is related to the pragmatist concept of ‚Äúcash value. It is the pragmatist‚Äôs contention that the true value of an idea should be measured by the practical results it produces.</li>
<li>the public display of the results of intellectual production with oneself as the client reflects the experimental attitude of pragmatism. The emphasis is on putting ideas into practice and learning from the results.</li>
<li>the importance of needs in personalized generation is consistent with the problem-solving orientation of pragmatism. The emphasis is on focusing on concrete problems and needs rather than abstract theories.</li>
<li>the importance of clearly verbalizing one‚Äôs needs is related to the anti-intellectualism attitude of pragmatism. The emphasis is on understanding concepts based on practical results rather than on definitions of words.</li>
<li>interpreting and applying the information obtained from the LLM in one‚Äôs own way is consistent with the empiricist attitude of pragmatism. It is important to make sense of the knowledge given to us in light of our own experience, rather than accepting it as given.</li>
</ol>
<p>As discussed above, these reflections on intellectual production have much in common with the ideas of pragmatism. The emphasis on practical results, incorporating diverse perspectives, and learning from experience are consistent with the core tenets of pragmatism, and intellectual production using LLM is a new form of intellectual practice that reflects pragmatism‚Äôs ideas.</p>

It will also be necessary to critically examine the findings presented by AI, not as absolutes, and to utilize them in light of human experience and values. Pragmatism can serve as a guideline for intellectual production in such an era.</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="backlinks"><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class="overflow"><li><a href="./Intellectual-production-techniques-for-engineers-who-use-LLM" class="internal">Intellectual production techniques for engineers who use LLM</a></li><li><a href="./LENCHI_needs-determine-the-appropriate-form-of-output" class="internal">LENCHI_needs determine the appropriate form of output</a></li></ul></div></div><footer class><p>Created with <a href="https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/">Quartz v4.4.0</a> ¬© 2024</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz">GitHub</a></li><li><a href="https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t">Discord Community</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body><script type="application/javascript">function c(){let t=this.parentElement;t.classList.toggle("is-collapsed");let l=t.classList.contains("is-collapsed")?this.scrollHeight:t.scrollHeight;t.style.maxHeight=l+"px";let o=t,e=t.parentElement;for(;e;){if(!e.classList.contains("callout"))return;let n=e.classList.contains("is-collapsed")?e.scrollHeight:e.scrollHeight+o.scrollHeight;e.style.maxHeight=n+"px",o=e,e=e.parentElement}}function i(){let t=document.getElementsByClassName("callout is-collapsible");for(let s of t){let l=s.firstElementChild;if(l){l.addEventListener("click",c),window.addCleanup(()=>l.removeEventListener("click",c));let e=s.classList.contains("is-collapsed")?l.scrollHeight:s.scrollHeight;s.style.maxHeight=e+"px"}}}document.addEventListener("nav",i);window.addEventListener("resize",i);
