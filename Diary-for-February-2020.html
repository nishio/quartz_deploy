<li>At the time, I was thinking, ‚ÄúBut I can‚Äôt afford not to go.</li>
<li>I think it was something like, ‚ÄúThe only people with a higher mortality rate are the elderly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A sense of urgency is heightened after hearing many stories at the reception.
<ul>
<li>Will the March 10 Unexplored Conference be held physically? The question is</li>
<li>Acquisition of the concept of medical collapse
<ul>
<li>It doesn‚Äôt matter how many deaths you have, you have to reduce the opportunities for people to be in concentrated contact with each other.</li>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>17-20</p>
<ul>
<li>Originally, Monday and Wednesday were off in lieu of working on weekends and holidays, but I thought a lot about it on Monday the 17th and started working from home full time early in the morning on the 18th for now.</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Tuesday, 2/18/2020 5:56 p.m. I will be working from home on Tuesday, on Wednesday I will be working in lieu of a holiday, and on Thursday I will be working from home.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Friday, 21st</p>
<ul>
<li>There are study sessions and regular meetings at the lab, which I physically attend.</li>
<li>This was my last day at work.</li>
</ul>
<p>24-27</p>
<ul>
<li>The following week, he worked from home all the way through Thursday.</li>
<li>I had planned to come in on Friday because the lab‚Äôs study session was my responsibility.</li>
<li>However, on the evening of Thursday, the 27th, a notice was issued stating that, ‚ÄúIn principle, avoid contact within 2 meters and for more than 30 minutes (intense contact).
<ul>
<li>Until then, ‚Äútelecommuting was encouraged,‚Äù but from the 28th it became ‚Äúnecessary for the general manager to deem it necessary to have intensive contact.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem here is that the monthly meeting of the Unexplored Association, METI, and IPA was scheduled to be held on March 3 in a conference room at Cybozu</p>
<ul>
<li>Definitely falls under the category of ‚Äúintensive contact‚Äù.</li>
<li>Mr. Kawai noticed this before I did and asked me about it, and we started the process of checking with METI and IPA to see if videoconferencing was possible.</li>
<li>Sakura Group also went to telecommuting in principle at a time when it was not much different. Unable to provide meeting rooms.</li>
<li>Confirmation results ‚Üí.
<ul>
<li>With Zoom, it‚Äôs possible because you can do it with just a web browser.</li>
<li>Pre-sharing materials because screen sharing is not possible.</li>
<li>No camera</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I didn‚Äôt think it was a good idea, but surprisingly it turned out OK.</li>
<li>Nishio will wind up around Zoom due to Mr. Kawai‚Äôs day off.
<ul>
<li>Originally, the Unexplored Foundation‚Äôs stand-alone meetings were basically online, with me hosting Zoom.</li>
<li>Just two of those, I thought.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Friday, February 28</p>
<ul>
<li>Study sessions and regular meetings are held online</li>
<li>Full Remote Mob Pro
<ul>
<li>The plan was to try mobpro, but the day before the event, we were not sure if it would work or not, but why don‚Äôt we give it a try? So we decided to give it a try.</li>
<li>If I‚Äôm giving a lecture, I‚Äôm talking one way, but I‚Äôm worried about not getting feedback from people who are watching at these meetings.</li>
<li>Posting in chat rooms, sharing the screen with the person you‚Äôre talking to is hard to notice.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>regular meeting
<ul>
<li>I mistakenly thought it was text reporting only, not video conferencing.</li>
<li>Therefore, he was in an environment that did not allow for voice.</li>
<li>Connect to a video conference without audio</li>
<li>I wrote a note saying that I couldn‚Äôt play audio, but they didn‚Äôt notice and thought I was leaving the room.</li>
<li>Communicate by writing on the shared screen with Zoom‚Äôs annotation function.</li>

<li>In response to a friend‚Äôs comment about whether the environment is conducive to teleworking in response to reports of tens of thousands of people working remotely in the city center.</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>I haven‚Äôt been in the office even a day this week, but at least Cybozu was able to go remote during the disaster, and since then we have solved the various problems we experienced at that time, so things are in place without any major issues. I think the turning point for companies in Tokyo was the earthquake.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúI want to do remote access during the earthquake and tsunami, and I want to use VPNs for simultaneous connections! I want to have voice communication with multiple people! Then, the number of connections was increased, all employees were using Zoom Pro, PCs for home use were distributed, and so on.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I like this kind of know-how, it‚Äôs easy to imitate when it‚Äôs all in one place.</p>

<li>
<blockquote>
<p>But this time, it was a case where the physical infrastructure of society was the cause of the problem, but this time it is people who are the cause of the problem, so there seems to be a challenge for salespeople. In this respect, it is easy for R&amp;D workers like me.</p>

<li>As of the 28th of the month I wrote this, I thought ‚Äúmost of the time you can work remotely, except for some types of jobs where you have to go to the site to do it.‚Äù
<ul>
<li>Yahoo is planning to work remotely throughout the company for the Olympics, and they‚Äôve moved it up.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I was surprised to see a report on 3/2 that ‚Äúestimates that 19% of Japanese companies have a telework environment.
<ul>
<li>Apparently 85% in the U.S.</li>
<li>The new Corona will be a catalyst for teleworking.‚Äù
<ul>
<li>Wasn‚Äôt the earthquake 9 years ago a trigger?</li>
<li>I thought the time frame was 9 years off from the majority of the world‚Äôs population.</li>

</ul>
<p>March 3</p>
<ul>
<li>Monthly meeting of Unexplored Corporation, METI and IPA</li>
<li>I had a wide schedule so that I could come in early and wait for the meeting, which caused an overlap in the schedule, and I don‚Äôt know if that was the cause, but it was the first time I, as the host, was unable to ‚Äúget into the meeting‚Äù.
<ul>
<li>I made sure that I had the option to join before the host, so I was able to proceed without me, and I went to reboot the machine.</li>
<li>At the regular meetings of the MISHOP, Mr. Arakawa, who was not the host, often facilitated the proceedings, so it was decided that he could be entrusted with the job.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There were some problems with feedback between machines in the same room, and problems with not picking up the voices of people who were far from the microphone, but they were not major problems.</li>

<li>If you just want to relay your presentation, you can use Zoom without installation on a loaned laptop.</li>
<li>Microphone only picks up the front direction, so there are problems picking up questions from the audience.</li>
<li>When I turn on the phone‚Äôs microphone to pick it up, I get feedback.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Zoom connection in a situation where ‚Äúsitting in a large venue with spacing‚Äù is being done locally, again via a browser without a single laptop installed, picking up the presenter‚Äôs voice was fine just by keeping the laptop pointed that way, but the problem was the questions in the venue. If you don‚Äôt at least point the relay machine toward the person speaking, the voice from diagonally behind won‚Äôt get in at all.
<ul>
<li>At this point, an attempt was made to connect to the Zoom from a handheld phone and turn on the microphone, but feedback occurred</li>
<li>The problem of microphones in large venues is still in the process of finding an inexpensive solution. With Cybozu, for example, there are a number of microphones hanging from the ceiling of the room, but that is expensive and it is most unlikely that a university classroom will be in that situation.</li>
<li>Putting a 360-degree mic in a conference room is well done, but I haven‚Äôt tried it to see if it can go as large as a classroom.</li>

<p>‚ÄúGanbarunna, Nippon,‚Äù some people might be offended by the literal meaning, but ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt we stop forcing people to go to the field by ‚Äúganbari‚Äù or ‚Äúair‚Äù in cases where it is physically unnecessary to go to the field?‚Äù That‚Äôs what it means <a href="https://www.facebook.com/1129148772/posts/10220896718024255?d=n&amp;sfns=mo" class="external">Facebook<svg aria-hidden="true" class="external-icon" style="max-width:0.8em;max-height:0.8em;" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><path d="M320 0H288V64h32 82.7L201.4 265.4 178.7 288 224 333.3l22.6-22.6L448 109.3V192v32h64V192 32 0H480 320zM32 32H0V64 480v32H32 456h32V480 352 320H424v32 96H64V96h96 32V32H160 32z"></path></svg></a>.</p>

<li>I was going to add FaceRig, too, but realized the same day that it didn‚Äôt work on my Mac.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>FaceRig is good for enhancing facial expressions.</li>
<li>At a company meeting, I observed people participating in animal avatars with FaceRig. Even if it is not a real face, there is no real harm, and in fact, it is good to emphasize facial expressions. In the world, people use virtual backgrounds or make-up faces even if they are not wearing makeup, but this method transmits neither the background nor the real face, so I thought this would be better for situations other than those where exposure of the real face is required.</li>
<li>As the conversation got a little crowded in a company meeting, I tried to organize it by writing on the screen from my iPad using Zoom‚Äôs annotation feature. There is still room for improvement in Zoom‚Äôs current functionality, but it is definitely better than verbal-only communication.</li>

<li>Communication style: the right to speak is passed on to the person who presses the ‚Äúsurprise‚Äù mark on the floor.</li>
<li>It‚Äôs interesting that the panelists are starting to experiment, you can survey the audience with psyllium, which is more informative than a regular hand raise.</li>
<li>I created my account in a random way, so my avatar doesn‚Äôt even have a face picture, but sometimes I see someone with a familiar icon walking by.</li>
<li>I‚Äôm not sure if I should be able to give negative feedback (when the audience says ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, I want a way to express that I don‚Äôt know‚Äù), and it‚Äôs not really necessary in use cases where psylliums are used a lot, but I think it would be nice to at least have a hatena for the class.

<li>I had a headache from noon, probably due to the low pressure, and headache medicine didn‚Äôt help, but I was able to watch the Unconference/Night from beginning to end while lying down in the middle of the program, so personally, online participation was easy and helpful.</li>
<li>I passed on the Zoom get-together because it was too hard for me, but there seemed to be some rooms that were well matched and had a lot of fun, and others that didn‚Äôt go so well and were scattered. I wish there was a way to hang around like a physical get-together.</li>
<li>I have seen some people say, ‚ÄúI usually can‚Äôt participate due to time or geographical problems, but I can participate in this event.</li>
<li>I‚Äôve observed that when matching on Zoom didn‚Äôt work (no people here, people here), the exchange of information was happening simultaneously on Mattermost, Slack and Facebook, so I guess that‚Äôs where the need is.

<li>It‚Äôs just a replay of the human network that already exists.</li>
<li>It seems that those who are not well placed in such a network are not able to make it work.</li>
<li>I think that is one of the functions of a social gathering and I would like to do something about it.</li>

<li>Fusion of physical and digital
- I think <a href="./robot-alter-ego" class="internal alias" data-slug="robot-alter-ego">robot alter ego</a> was well done.
- It‚Äôs easy to tell at a glance if someone is inside or not, and who is on site.
- The neck moves with the camera, making it easy to see where the person inside is gazing.
- Locals can easily know if they are being watched.
- I get a strong sense of ‚Äúnot being able to move my body‚Äù when I‚Äôm in a computer that‚Äôs popped up in the hall.
- I like to look around when there‚Äôs nothing in front of me.
- This natural desire cannot be fulfilled.</li>

<li>I felt I had to record my impressions of what I have experienced in the past few weeks, especially with regard to the ‚Äúexperience of replacing conventional physical assemblages without physically assembling‚Äù while the impressions are fresh.</li>
<li>In 80% of the world, apparently, you can‚Äôt work remotely, but in the 5 meters around me, it‚Äôs ‚Äúa month where we focus our wisdom on using technology to create a better experience, with the basic premise that we don‚Äôt physically assemble‚Äù.</li>
<li>My own last day of work was February 21, and the company announced on Thursday the 27th to avoid unnecessary and intensive contact, and the majority of people working in the Tokyo office have never come to work since then.</li>
<li>All Cybozu employees have a Zoom Pro account, so they often experience the host side in these situations, such as meetings with external parties or live broadcasts of events.</li>
<li>Yesterday‚Äôs unattended conference night was held without an audience, and apparently even those on site were not allowed to applaud.
<ul>
<li>In a recent public session of the Information Processing Society of Japan held in a VR space, participants were able to press the clap button at any given moment. The latter applause was loud enough not to interfere with the presenter‚Äôs presentation, and was displayed emoticonically overhead, not just as a mere sound.</li>
<li>The problem of turning off the microphone and making it easy for the listener to become airborne is solved by lowering the feedback threshold for the listener.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>At yesterday‚Äôs Unexplored Night, the reception was replaced by the use of multiple Zoom rooms, and this seemed to work well in some rooms and not so well in others. A system had been introduced whereby people were matched according to keywords of interest entered in advance, but the rooms of those who did not enter any keywords were successfully wiped out.
<ul>
<li>In three chat rooms and social networking sites, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no one here‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhere is everyone?‚Äù were the types of conversations we observed occurring.</li>
<li>In the real world, information is communicated that ‚Äúpeople are there‚Äù without words being exchanged, but this operation did not convey this information.</li>
<li>I was told that if you have a get-together by videoconference, you can extend it arbitrarily without having to find an after-party venue. But I‚Äôm not sure that would require a longer meeting reservation for the get-together.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Both ‚Äúthere‚Äôs someone in that conference room‚Äù and ‚ÄúVR applause‚Äù mean we need an easy way to share information that isn‚Äôt through speech.</li>

<li>No, no, there is a bias in the scope of all people‚Äôs observations.</li>
