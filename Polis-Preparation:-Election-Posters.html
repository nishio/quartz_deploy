<p>You are preparing for a productive deliberation. a is the opinion that has come up so far. a is a list of short statements that people can agree or disagree with. B is additional unorganized commentary on this opinion; extract opinions from B that do not overlap with A to form a short list of opinions that people can express for or against.</p>
<p>A
There should be restrictions on the content of election posters.
Police intervention in the removal of election posters is a threat to democracy.
Obscene election posters are within the scope of freedom of expression.
Selling election poster slots as advertising should be regulated.
The deposit system is necessary to protect democracy.
Odd campaign posters are a legitimate strategy to attract voters‚Äô attention.
Election posters that cannot be shown to children should not be displayed in public places.
Regulation of election posters infringes on candidates‚Äô freedom of expression.
Mass media should increase election coverage.
Regulation of election posters runs the risk of arbitrary operation.
Running insane candidates is also important for democracy.
The regulation of election posters should be clearly defined by law.
Radical posters are a sign of the health of democracy.
Police intervention is more problematic than the content of the election posters.
Any attempt to use the electoral system for personal gain should be regulated.
There should be restrictions on sexual expression in the content of election posters.
The police should provide a voluntary service to pre-check the legality of election posters.
Only candidates themselves should be allowed to issue election posters.
Election posters should always include the candidate‚Äôs name and claims about the election.
Election posters should be abolished and replaced with other means of election publicity.
Election posters should be subject to the same laws and regulations as general advertising.
The purpose of election posters should be to provide information rather than freedom of expression.
A distinction should be made and regulated between pornographic expression and artistic nudity.
The method of placing election posters should be standardized and barriers to new entrants should be lowered.
As a consideration for those who ‚Äúdon‚Äôt want to see it,‚Äù the display of sexually explicit election posters should be restricted.</p>
<p>B
This series of discussions on election posters should be seen as an opportunity to revise the Public Offices Election Law.
If the expression is rooted in the candidate‚Äôs identity, it should not be restricted
To begin with, the current election poster system is out of step with the times. It is too much to the disadvantage of candidates who lack financial and organizational strength. We need to think about a way of doing election bulletins that is more in tune with the times.
‚ÄúElection posters should always include the candidate‚Äôs name and a statement about the election.‚Äù The answer to the question ‚Äúis it about laws and regulations or ethics?‚Äù depends on whether you are talking about laws and regulations or ethics.
Obscene posters have the effect of rather driving some of the viewers away from the billboards, which in itself is an obstruction to free electioneering.
I think it‚Äôs okay to create (insane) candidates the first time around, as long as they are re-elected until they get more than a majority of the votes.
All election posters should be restricted for those who do not want to see them.
Displaying posters interspersed with other election posters, which significantly increase the number of people who do not want them in view, is also an infringement on the freedom of expression of other candidates to promote their policies.
For the police to make any kind of judgment about the content of an election poster is prior censorship.</p>

The discussion on election posters should be seen as an opportunity to revise the Public Offices Election Law.
Expression rooted in a candidate's identity should not be restricted.
The current election poster system is disadvantageous to candidates with limited financial and organizational resources, and a method of election bulletins that is appropriate for the times should be considered.
Obscene posters have the effect of keeping voters away from the board and interfering with free electioneering.
A system of re-election should be introduced until a majority of the votes is obtained.
In order to protect the freedom of expression of other candidates, we should restrict the display of posters that will noticeably increase the number of people who do not want to see them in view.
Police making judgments about the content of election posters constitutes prior censorship.

<p>B
Not only election posters, but also sexually explicit postings should be discussed keeping in mind that there are people, including adults as well as children, who do not want to see them.
In Taiwan and Scandinavia, I think I have seen fewer sexually oriented posters, but I think they are concerned about the way people are sexualized, their own choices, and people‚Äôs comfort. Election posters should be free by nature, but I recommend using the police to check in advance if it is an expression that breaks the law. However, the use of the police is voluntary. Election posters should be issued by the candidates themselves. The use of election posters as a means of advertising by anyone other than the candidate himself/herself is prohibited. The restrictions should be that the candidate‚Äôs name must appear on the poster and that the poster should be his or her own statement for the election in question. We believe that the significance of posters is becoming less significant in the first place, and that abolishing them is a better idea. Even election posters should be subject to other legal systems In the first place, what is required of election posters is not expression Pornography and nudity are different. The problem this time is the former. Rather than increasing the number of prohibited items, election posters should have more restrictive conditions in the first place. Posters are a barrier to new entrants, so they should be posted with the posters attached from the beginning.</p>
<p>Below is a short list of statements that people can express their agreement or disagreement with, based on A and B:</p>
<p>There should be restrictions on sexual expression in the content of election posters.
The police should provide a voluntary service to pre-check the legality of election posters.
Only candidates themselves should be allowed to issue election posters.
Election posters should always include the candidate‚Äôs name and claims about the election.
Election posters should be abolished and replaced with other means of election publicity.
Election posters should be subject to the same laws and regulations as general advertising.
The purpose of election posters should be to provide information rather than freedom of expression.

I wondered why there were so many election posters this time, were they advertising space?
Currently, the election board can‚Äôt regulate it, but I think it‚Äôs a bad idea to take this opportunity to think about it.</p>
<p>I have never felt more grateful for the right to vote than I did in this gubernatorial election.
This right must be exercised.</p>

There are so many candidates of NHK party, but they don‚Äôt put their pictures on the column where election posters are put up, it seems they are doing it for business to sell it as an advertising space.</p>

<p>I doubt the morals of both these parties and those who advertise.</p>
<p>*The picture is an image, but if you buy a frame, you can jack up the N Party column and put all the ads you want.
