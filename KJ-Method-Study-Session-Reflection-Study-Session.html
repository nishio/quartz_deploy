<li>Purpose of this time
<ul>
<li>There has been a lot of development in the four months between the time of the August study session and now.</li>
<li>Reflecting on the differences</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>2022-12-02 Day of the event</p>
<ul>
<li>Something pretty interesting happened.
<ul>
<li>The only pre-assignment was to make 25 labels and read the lecture material.
<ul>
<li>However, when I looked on the morning of the day, I saw that about 20 people who had learned how to do it from the lecture materials had started to make a net.</li>
<li>Very active, proactive and good</li>
<li>Has the fact that everyone’s work status is shared in Miro had a positive impact?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I went around with my comments as of this morning because there is no benefit to procrastination.

<ul>
<li>In retrospect, this was a very good case study collection.</li>
<li>Individuals are starting in advance and rounding up where appropriate.</li>
<li>So many of them are in a “state of crispness” and “stumbling hands” compared to what I look around and observe in real time during the workshop!</li>

<ul>
<li>This was also very good.
<ul>
<li>We were able to have 45 people in parallel, which is difficult to do in a physical event.</li>
<li>There’s a psychological resistance to raising your hand and asking questions in a real setting.
<ul>
<li>→Writing in Slack is less psychologically burdensome because you don’t get so much attention from people around you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(The Nishio side is always in full operation, so there is a heavy burden.)</li>

<li>Digital data so comments can be looked back on later.

<li>I have a record of everything we’ve discussed, including taking screen shots.</li>
<li>It’s been a very good resource.</li>

<li>The problem that people around you stop and try to listen to you when you communicate with them by voice in a physical setting.

<li>Since it was a chat, that didn’t happen either (probably).</li>

</ul>
<p>Early, Middle, and Late</p>
<ul>
<li>Jiro Kawakita’s ideas have changed over the past 20 years.
<ul>
<li>This is par for the course.
<ul>
<li>Jiro Kawakita was a smart man who could learn from new experiences and update his ideas.</li>
<li>It would be even stranger if the idea hadn’t changed for 20 years.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>But “thinking” naturally changes over a 20-year period, and the “long time span” “changing and dynamic worldview” was not well shared.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Three epochal books have been published at approximately 10-year intervals
<ul>
<li>First semester 1967 “Idea method”</li>
<li>Mid 1977 “Exploratory Studies of Knowledge”</li>
<li>Late 1988 “KJ Method: Let Chaos Speak for Itself”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>These three books were called the “Early, Middle, and Late Periods.”
<ul>
<li>This apparently made it easier to imagine Jiro Kawakita’s thoughts changing and evolving.
<ul>
<li>With a name to point to [The world that was a blur has been carved out.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How was the last fiscal year?
<ul>
<li>1967 Publication of “Ideas”.</li>
<li>The first prerequisite is to have a huge amount of routine data.
<ul>
<li>How to summarize the vast amount of qualitative data
<ul>
<li>Categorizing and organizing routine data by homogeneity does not make it “cohesive”.</li>
<li>How to synthesize heterogeneous data is important (p. 53).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>~ and proposed a methodology for</li>
<li>In Nishio’s lecture, to clearly distinguish the KJ method at this point, he referred to it as the “KJ method of the beginning.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What happened in the mid-term
<ul>
<li>1977 “<a href="./Exploratory-Studies-of-Knowledge" class="internal alias" data-slug="Exploratory-Studies-of-Knowledge">Exploratory Studies of Knowledge</a>” published.</li>
<li>He says something like, “I thought the KJ method was the bottleneck, but the bottleneck was not the KJ method but the interview phase before the KJ method” (p. 28).
<ul>
<li>If the quality of the data collected in the first place is poor, the quality of the results of the KJ method is also poor (p. 29).</li>
<li>He insisted that the interview phase in front of the KJ method needs to be improved.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Expedition Net] is created by applying KJ legal ideas.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What will happen in the second half of the year
<ul>
<li>1988 “KJ method: Let the chaos speak for itself.”</li>
<li>Starting with no data, the idea of “<a href="./Fireworks-to-think-about" class="internal alias" data-slug="Fireworks-to-think-about">Fireworks to think about</a>” becomes clear.</li>
<li>Positioning “Explore-Net-Fireworks” as the “twin brother of the KJ method” and the “practical application of the KJ method.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What does a quick bird’s eye view of this trend mean in comparison?
<ul>
<li>Last term: large amount of information already exists “KJ method of beginnings”</li>
<li>Mid-term: Focus on ways to gather information</li>
<li>Late: I generate new information “Thinking Fireworks”</li>
<li>The basic premise of the last term was that [* a large amount of information was already available
<ul>
<li>In reality, however, when I actually tried to teach various people, I found that the “assumption of a large amount of information” was not correct in the first place.</li>
<li>In the medium term, it becomes “We need to gather information first, right?</li>
<li>What is the first step in the process of gathering that information?
<ul>
<li>First do a thorough <a href="./interior-exploration" class="internal alias" data-slug="interior-exploration">interior exploration</a> and put into words what you think the problem is, what you want it to be, and what you think should be done to solve it.</li>
<li>It’s going to be that you need to be in a place where you generate new information.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In retrospect, I see that “I create new information” was also done in the “How to summarize a lot of data” phase of the “Beginning KJ Method”.
<ul>
<li>Jiro Kawakita realized after trying to put it together and not being able to put it together (Idea method, p. 54) that it is important that he creates even when putting it together.</li>
<li>This realization later became a system called the KJ method</li>
<li>In other words, “putting together” is actually closely coupled with “conceiving.
<ul>
<li>That’s why the result of thinking about “how to organize” is published under the name of “Idea Method” and explained in a chapter called “KJ Method for Promoting Ideas.</li>
</ul>
</li>

</ul>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Any questions so far?</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>How is the latter term “I generate new information” used in situations like mobile universities and fieldwork?
<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>If we apply Jiro Kawakita’s concept in the mid-term, you say, “We need <a href="./Interior-Exploration" class="internal alias" data-slug="Interior-Exploration">Interior Exploration</a> before we start the interview.
<ul>
<li>There is a phase where I first explore my mind and clarify “what needs to be covered in the future”.</li>
<li>It’s like it became a firework to think about.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>Okay. Thank you very much.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>What kind of image do you have, Nishio-san?
<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>The former.
<ul>
<li>Jiro Kawakita, who was able to do well and already had data that he had collected through interviews, did not understand that people in the world were stumped on how to collect data.</li>
<li>You don’t know because you haven’t experienced it yourself.</li>
<li>So I released a book called “How to Think” about what I did with the “data after I collected it”.</li>
<li>Over the next 10 years or so, Jiro Kawakita gained experience in teaching by being asked by various people, “Please teach me this KJ method.</li>
<li>Then I realized that the data was wrong in the first place, and that many people stumble here.</li>
<li>So in the mid-term, with the “exploratory study of knowledge,” we’re talking about “we need to do a better job of collecting data, right?”</li>
<li>Jiro Kawakita’s ideas developed as a result of his new experiences.</li>
<li>So “if you are in the same situation as in the previous period, you can of course continue to use the same method as in the previous period”!</li>
<li>Jiro Kawakita realized that there are various situations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>Okay, so if you get the interview part right in a way like the Exploration Net, then you can use the “Beginning KJ method” to summarize and generate ideas.</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Yes, yes, that’s the image I have.
<ul>
<li>Let me explain from another angle.</li>
<li>Jiro Kawakita was unaware of the necessary conditions to do the “KJ method of beginnings” the way he did in the previous period.</li>
<li>As I was teaching the KJ method, I realized I needed good coverage.</li>
<li>That’s why we built an expedition net in the mid-term.</li>
<li>Jiro Kawakita was unaware of the necessary conditions to make that expedition net work.
<ul>
<li>While teaching exploratory net,
<ul>
<li>Before “explore, collect data, and create a net.”</li>
<li>We need to do a phase of thinking about what we are going to do.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>That is, in essence, the equivalent of what we called “internal exploration” in the terminology of the early-mid period.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The “Thinking Fireworks” organized it into a specific methodology of “writing a theme in the middle and placing your thoughts around it”.</li>
<li>and gradually moving to the front in the process flow.
<ul>
<li>You need to do Y first before you can do X, notice the prerequisite.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>All data is a lie. Use the data knowing it to be false. And from that, we can determine the more correct truth. That is the path to judgment. But how can the truth be determined from a lie?

</ul>
</li>
<li>Jiro Kawakita viewed the data that way, based on this,</li>
<li>Can I add my own thoughts that come to mind while I’m doing the KJ method?” Answer the question “Yes.
<ul>
<li>First of all, [anything that comes to mind should be recorded.
- [If you don’t record it, it disappears.
<ul>
<li>What you come up with could be beneficial.
<ul>
<li>It could prove beneficial later.</li>
<li>It would be a shame to keep it only in your head and let it disappear.</li>
<li>So we should record it first.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I think this is the main principle of intellectual production, regardless of whether you do the KJ method or not.</li>

<li>This is “data” of course, since it is “data of my thoughts observed and recorded”.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Either you mix this data right now or you don’t.
<ul>
<li>You can mix it right up.</li>
<li>You can keep it close by and focus on sorting through the data that came in from the outside first.</li>
<li>Earlier, I asked, “Are you going to distinguish them with a mark or something?” There was a question
<ul>
<li>You can make a distinction, you don’t have to make a distinction, just do whichever suits your purpose.</li>
<li>When it’s a “decide what I’m going to do next” type of firework to think about, there’s not much need to distinguish between the two.</li>
<li>I think some people want to distinguish between their opinions and the data collected when it comes to “compiling a report that separates my opinions from the data collected.”
<ul>
<li>However, in this day and age, if the data collected is digital, it is easy to find out where it came from by searching, and I think there is little need for humans to mark labels and do their best to distinguish between the two.</li>

<ul>
<li>If you can draw useful conclusions from the data alone, that’s the best you can do.
<ul>
<li>That’s what we should aim for first.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In many cases, however, data alone is not enough to reach a conclusion.
<ul>
<li>Pinched before reaching a conclusion.</li>
<li>It’s like, “There’s so much information out there, it’s a mess, how do I organize it?”
<ul>
<li>Jiro Kawakita had trouble with this before he created the KJ method, as described in “Idea Method,” p. 52.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It’s not productive to dwell on “what should I do…” at this time.
<ul>
<li>Nothing is going ahead.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Worse yet, “There are some parts that are organized and some messes that aren’t. Let’s just use the parts that are organized.”
<ul>
<li>This is so bad.</li>
<li>for some reason
<ul>
<li>Where it was organized quickly, where it matched existing thinking, existing <a href="./frame-of-mind" class="internal alias" data-slug="frame-of-mind">frame of mind</a>.
<ul>
<li>I was able to organize it quickly because I was able to <a href="./rhetorical-flourish" class="internal alias" data-slug="rhetorical-flourish">rhetorical flourish</a> the <a href="./framework" class="internal" data-slug="framework">framework</a> of ideas that I already had.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Using only that and throwing away a mess that was not well organized is just reproducing the existing framework of thinking.
<ul>
<li>No new ones are created.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The seeds of new ideas should have been discovered in the discarded parts.
<ul>
<li>And yet, you only pick up and use data that supports your existing perceptions, your existing frame of thought.</li>

<li>What’s wrong.
<ul>
<li>The “hierarchical structure” of “family > daughter > eldest daughter” is strongly expressed.</li>
<li>I’ve even drawn the boundaries of the group.</li>
<li>This is a pre-expressed “natural structure”.</li>
<li>It is rare that something new and interesting comes out of here.
<ul>
<li>Why?
- <a href="./Existing-Structure" class="internal alias" data-slug="Existing-Structure">Existing Structure</a> boundaries prevent the discovery of new structures.
- The boundaries represented by this “eldest daughter” circle get in the way of discovering new associations.
- At the time a new structure is discovered it is weak, so it loses out to a strong existing structure.
- Existing structures need to be dismantled.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>advice
<ul>
<li>What is represented by this “big circle” is “the group that originally had it.”
<ul>
<li>The “boundaries” on this one are obstructive.</li>
<li>This is a concept that was originally in my head.”</li>
<li>Let’s take it off.</li>

<li>This one has no group boundaries drawn, but the label is tasteless.</li>
<li>Terminal labels such as “flower” and “sunset” are currently “too abstract a concept.”
<ul>
<li>Concrete images are truncated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Flowers and sunsets, if they are placed side by side, there is essentially some relationship between them.

<li>I want to be able to describe what the relationship between these two pieces is by looking at the two labels.</li>

<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>The KJ method case study I saw was on the subject of “What is valuable to you?”
<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>I see
<ul>
<li>I knew that “value <a href="./for-me" class="internal alias" data-slug="for-me">for me</a>” and so on.</li>
<li>Like, “What do you find interesting <a href="./to-you" class="internal alias" data-slug="to-you">to you</a>?”</li>
<li>Maybe I should have been more explicit about that sort of thing.</li>
<li>When I saw that they put “observation” in the middle, I was like, “Oh (>_&lt;).”
<ul>
<li>You’re already thinking abstractly when you set up this theme.</li>
<li>I feel that when you set a theme of “Okay, let’s KJ about observations” instead of something specific, I feel like “No, you’re talking a lot <a href="./have-no-roots" class="internal alias" data-slug="have-no-roots">have no roots</a>.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Another example was someone who had a theme like “I’ll have an anniversary vacation soon, what shall I do?” and I think that was a good, specific theme.
<ul>
<li>It’s, “<a href="./*I-am" class="internal alias" data-slug="*I-am">*I am</a> what I want.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The rest were deep in thought about “how I will live my life.”
<ul>
<li>I found it interesting in terms of the theme itself, but I’m commenting on the “form” of the theme, and I don’t want to get too deep into a discussion of the specifics of the theme, so I didn’t dig too deep into it.</li>
<li>(Tip: In one-on-one or small group situations, I may be the one to listen to the “verbal explanation of the group’s content” and then ask a <a href="./Clean-Question" class="internal alias" data-slug="Clean-Question">Clean Question</a>. I do not give my opinion when “teaching the KJ method,” but if we have a relationship where <a href="./Undesirable-Compromise" class="internal alias" data-slug="Undesirable-Compromise">Undesirable Compromise</a> does not occur, I may share my opinion.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>I thought it was interesting that there was such freedom to set various themes.</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>I’m sorry for him in this case study 8, but I learned a lesson from the observation that “if you give a theme complete freedom, some people will rub you the wrong way in the theme-setting stage.”
<ul>
<li>I needed to limit the scope of the topic a bit more and give some direction.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>PS: In organizing this Q&amp;A conversation, I noticed that all of the “good” themes included “I am” and “for me”. It seems that “<a href="./personal-affair" class="internal alias" data-slug="personal-affair">personal affair</a>” is an important direction.</li>

<ul>
<li>On the KJ method creating “<a href="./awareness" class="internal" data-slug="awareness">awareness</a>” and “<a href="./idea" class="internal" data-slug="idea">idea</a>”
<ul>
<li>People who’ve been there will say, “Of course they do.”</li>
<li>People who haven’t experienced it will say, “I don’t know what you’re talking about.</li>
<li>There was no verbalization of what exactly “awareness” meant.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This time, we have a clear, concrete example.</li>
<li>Realization that “this is something relevant, although it is placed far away now.”
<ul>
<li>
<p>This time, the action of “drawing a line” was added to the “exploration net” origin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This led to frequent cases of lines being drawn between “labels placed at a distance”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><img src="https://gyazo.com/bbb7b6791477bbe1c73160b6506f76ca/thumb/1000" alt="image"/></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is “awareness.”</p>
<ul>
<li>Before the lines were drawn, I thought “the two are unrelated.”
<ul>
<li>That’s why I put them apart.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>But after the fact, I thought, “There seems to be a relationship between the two.”
<ul>
<li>So the line was drawn.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The timing when this line is drawn is the timing of “awareness”.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What does the KJ method without lines do in such a situation?</p>
<ul>
<li>The way to express that “awareness” was to “move it closer.</li>
<li>This destroys the “pre-aware” “<a href="./assumed-frame-of-mind" class="internal alias" data-slug="assumed-frame-of-mind">assumed frame of mind</a>” and a new structure emerges.</li>
<li>However, we tend to feel psychological resistance to this “movement with destruction
<ul>
<li>Priority is given to “objectively correct,” “known structures,” and “hierarchical organization.”</li>
<li>Ignoring or downplaying my subjective feeling of “this and that seem to be related”.</li>
<li>But that feeling is more important.
<ul>
<li>Brain structures that I had in my mind before I saw the actual data.
<ul>
<li>Assumption that this is the way it would be</li>
<li>So this is not looking at the data.</li>
<li>So that’s what I thought before I looked at the data.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The structure “before” looking at the data and what you realize is related to this and that “after” looking at the data.
<ul>
<li>The latter realization is naturally more important</li>
<li>We need to change the value system that says</li>

<p>How about Jiro Kawakita’s original expedition net</p>
<ul>
<li>I was not using a digital tool that allows me to draw lines of any length.</li>
<li>The relationship was “clipped.”

</ul>
</li>
<li>As a result, the only way to keep things relevant was to keep them close together.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>By using the Miro digital tool, I can now draw lines from a distance.</p>
<ul>
<li>Can express “relevant” without psychological resistance, even if it is far away.
<ul>
<li>This is good.
<ul>
<li>The bar has been lowered.</li>
<li>Information that “I can’t verbalize in words, but I think it’s relevant” can be recorded.</li>
<li>Output, out of the mind, can be made indelible.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On the other hand, it’s now possible to “leave it far away”.
<ul>
<li>The freedom of digital tools has allowed for bad expression.</li>
<li>There were a lot of lines drawn, and people were getting crossed all over the place and messed up, and they were like, “What am I supposed to do?”</li>
<li>I couldn’t have made that kind of crossing when I was expressing it with a clip.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lines drawn later are more important because they are “newly noticed”.</li>
<li>You can move the label around to shorten the line.</li>
<li>(Jiro Kawakita is opposed to moving it on a large scale. This is where Nishio and I disagree, and it will become clear in the future what this disagreement stems from. (Opposition to the Great Migration of Peoples], to be written in the future.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can take care of the anxiety of destruction with “just copy and keep it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Once the current mess is copied and set aside (you can go back to it if you want).</li>
<li>Transform to shorten the line</li>

<ul>
<li>Rather, that’s what they’re doing.</li>
<li>I think it’s connected.” This is what I realized.</li>

<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>This “breaking the structure” could be done in such a way that a human does it until the line is drawn, and once the line is drawn, the system breaks the structure for you.</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>It is technically possible to formulate a spring model, for example, from the state where this line is drawn.</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>If we break them down, it may lead to the discovery of a new human structure, saying, “This kind of structure exists.</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Yes, indeed.
<ul>
<li>In fact, we have tried auto-shaping with a spring model, and the reason why we are not doing it now is because “it is irritating when the auto-shaping moves the position while a human is placing the model”.</li>
<li>It’s irritating because it’s “destruction in the making” to be moved by the system when humans are “expressing by arrangement what has not yet been put into words”.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>I see</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>I just had this discussion and thought that if I had a “backup of the current version so that I could go back to it,” then the machine could change the arrangement.

<li>It’s not that difficult to reshape this with a spring model after all of these things are connected.</li>
<li>Actually, Kozaneba already has the code to format it with the spring model, the menu is just disabled.</li>

<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>You generate a force that brings you closer together between things connected by lines, and then you apply a repulsive force against this individual block.

<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>You draw one line to make it, and then you take all the lines and shuffle them around and make another one, so you can see it on a different axis.</li>

<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>I don’t know what I would do if I were you, I’d put it to bed and start over again when I forgot about it.</p>

<ul>
<li>And we need to talk about that “<a href="./ferment" class="internal" data-slug="ferment">ferment</a>.”</li>
<li>It’s totally fine to leave things lying around that don’t come together at a certain point.</li>
<li>You let them sleep on it, forget about it for a week, for example, and come back to it after doing another job.</li>
<li>Then, once you look at the Internet with a reset head and newly input knowledge, you will see the following.
<ul>
<li>I’m like, “Oh, there’s a connection between here and here.”</li>
<li>I’ll say something like, “That thing I saw on another job I was working on recently leads to this label.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>So it happens that labels are added, lines are added.</li>
<li>As the number of “expressed realizations” increases in this way, we gradually begin to see a form.</li>
<li>So I think it’s quite beneficial to put the net down for a week and look at it again!</li>

</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>Okay, I can see that as a realization.</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>I’ve given lectures and then a year later I’m asked to speak again on a similar topic, and I’ve done things like reuse lecture materials and create other lecture materials.
<ul>
<li>I have a feeling that it is quite beneficial to take lecture materials that have been sitting for a year, put them back together again in fragments, add new information, and reconstruct them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>I can relate to that, and I do too.
<ul>
<li>I only remember the important stuff and forget the details, which is a nice touch.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>For example, if you try to reuse something that is left in detail in the form of a text, and you try to reuse it well, what you had “before you read it” will wipe out at the time you are reading it.
<ul>
<li>There is a more favorable feeling to reconstruct from information that is so rough that the associative network of sticky notes is connected.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>In terms of reconfiguration, maybe so.</li>

<li>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>As for the first question When you first put down a sticky note, you put it down as you put it up”, there are two ways to do it, as far as whether you put down the labels sequentially or not.</p>
<ul>
<li>What I really wanted to do this time was “just have a label for the theme in the middle and add what I associate with it.</li>
<li>But I thought if we did that, we wouldn’t have enough time.</li>
<li>So I gave him the advice, “Write 25 labels in advance.”</li>
<li>There was a sense that this caused confusion.</li>
<li>If we were to do it a second time.
<ul>
<li>Write the theme on the middle label.</li>
<li>Prepare 25 labels according to the following procedure: 1.
<ul>
<li>Create labels by association with the labels they are placed on.</li>
<li>Draw a line with the source of the association and leave it there.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To keep the shape of everything connected.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I think it would be good to do something like</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>Did you originally want to do a thinking fireworks type thing?</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>That’s right.
<ul>
<li>The real “thinking fireworks” have a theme in the middle and are increased by association from scratch.</li>
<li>But for some people, that phase seems to take a long time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>Yes, they have to come out.</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>There are people who get stuck, or who spend half an hour writing only 10 pages.
<ul>
<li>And if that happens, you can’t do the later phases, if they say there are only 10 sheets.</li>
<li>So the risk is crazy high for a workshop with limited time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>I see</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>I was afraid that would happen, so I said, “Please prepare 25 copies in advance.”
<ul>
<li>When I observed the people I worked with beforehand, there were a lot of “people who were not connected to the central theme and were doing the KJ method that they were used to, with the theme in the middle,” so I thought there might have been a better way to give them guidance.</li>

<li>It’s not about whether it’s right, it’s about whether the bike moves forward.”</li>
<li>This metaphor was further developed in the process of reworking the lecture material.</li>
<li>To “move forward” is to “realize something you didn’t realize before.”

<li>I have to hold the handlebars and pedal by myself.</li>
<li>“I take the wheel” = I make the decisions about what direction to go.</li>

<p>(I only talked about part of this page because I had little time.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2018, when I wrote <a href="./The-Intellectual-Production-of-Engineers" class="internal alias" data-slug="The-Intellectual-Production-of-Engineers">The Intellectual Production of Engineers</a>, I asked, “Why don’t you give this intellectual production technique a name like the KJ method?” I was asked.</p>
<ul>
<li>I said, “I won’t name names.”
<ul>
<li>Deliberately avoided naming names from the time of writing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>for some reason
<ul>
<li>This manuscript was written in 2017.
<ul>
<li>I wrote the book thinking, “The paper method is useful, but it has a number of problems, it needs to be electronic.”</li>
<li>No digital tool had yet satisfied me.</li>
<li>After the writing was done, we started developing digital tools.
<ul>
<li>This led to the current [Kozaneba digital stationery to organize your thoughts</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I think in retrospect that at the time I was writing it, I had the feeling that the way I was doing it at the moment was not the finished version.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>2022 <a href="./KJ-Method-Study-Session-@-Loftwork" class="internal alias" data-slug="KJ-Method-Study-Session-@-Loftwork">KJ Method Study Session @ Loftwork</a> at</p>
<ul>
<li>I told him, “Let’s make our own style,” and “It’s good to exchange information about our own style.”</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: <a href="./name-your-own-style" class="internal alias" data-slug="name-your-own-style">name your own style</a> and might be easier to distribute/exchange?</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>And I thought, “That’s right.”</li>
<li>for some reason
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>It makes sense to create a <a href="./lingua-franca" class="internal alias" data-slug="lingua-franca">lingua franca</a> to share within the organization, but as a preliminary step, it might be a good idea to secretly give your methods a personal name (<a href="./Personal-words" class="internal alias" data-slug="Personal-words">Personal words</a>).</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Unnamed concepts are like liquid, elusive and difficult to manipulate</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Naming the concept allows us to manipulate it with a handle, like coffee in a mug (<a href="./Metaphor-of-liquid-in-a-container" class="internal alias" data-slug="Metaphor-of-liquid-in-a-container">Metaphor of liquid in a container</a>).</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>The first step before creating a common language is to give a personal name to your method.</li>
<li>It is easier to manipulate than unnamed concepts</li>
<li>By naming a concept, you turn that concept into an object that can be manipulated and handled with a handle, like “liquid is in a container.”</li>
<li>This is the story I wrote in <a href="./The-Intellectual-Production-of-Engineers" class="internal alias" data-slug="The-Intellectual-Production-of-Engineers">The Intellectual Production of Engineers</a> p.36 [(Column) To name the pattern.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compare with 2018 decisions</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing in a book with a name” is the equivalent of creating “a common language shared around the world.”</li>
<li>The 2018 decision “not at the stage of naming names” is “not at the stage of creating a common language.”</li>
<li>Giving a “private name” as a preliminary step is beneficial</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>So I gave a tentative name to Nishio’s own style.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="./Presentation-Story-Construction-Method" class="internal alias" data-slug="Presentation-Story-Construction-Method">Presentation Story Construction Method</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is literally the method we use to create the presentation story</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>KJ method combined with [knee-swing (gymnastics)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fragments of a story are told as stickies, and related stickies are connected to each other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sticky notes are placed in close proximity or connected by lines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ones we’ve determined we’re going to talk about in this order, we’re going to group them in close proximity and lump them together.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is Kozaneba and can be folded up.</li>
<li>If you decide to quit, just ungroup.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The process of sticking things together to make them stick is the equivalent of stapling in the Kozane method.</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="https://gyazo.com/3f79670a7f18423e3c645f0effa41bcd/thumb/1000" alt="image"/> <a href="./The-Art-of-Intellectual-Production" class="internal alias" data-slug="The-Art-of-Intellectual-Production">The Art of Intellectual Production</a> p.204</li>
<li>In the Kozane method, when you think “this is how the story goes,” you staple it together into a single chunk.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Roughly, it’s like starting at the top left and finishing at the bottom right.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, a sticky note introducing oneself is placed in the upper left corner.</li>
<li>If there is group work after the lecture, the explanation of how to proceed goes on the bottom right.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most of the rest of the stickies are pulled into place by lines and stuff.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>Why not start in the middle?</p>
<ul>
<li>I think the one by Loftwork started in the middle.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>When creating lecture materials from scratch, we sometimes do a divergence phase with the theme in the middle, like <a href="./Fireworks-to-think-about" class="internal alias" data-slug="Fireworks-to-think-about">Fireworks to think about</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>On the other hand, the real value of this method is when you already have the materials.
<ul>
<li>I’m told that there are past presentation materials that need to be changed in their structure.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There is a “back-and-forth adjacency” between “already written out sentences and presentations.”</li>
<li>Already in a state where the connection between the material and its</li>
<li>I use this when I want to reuse it.</li>
<li>So in most cases, the material is already there.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>Can we have a general outline, like speaking in this order, and extend it from the upper left to the lower right?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>It’s a situation where the general framework is set but needs to be changed.</p>
<ul>
<li>When constraints, such as presentation time or audience prerequisite knowledge, change</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>When we decided to do a 30-minute lecture on the one-hour version of the KJ method, we rearranged the materials and said, “Well, let’s see what we can cut out.</li>
<li>For example, the self-introduction was about this much on the original slide.
<ul>
<li>
<p><img src="https://gyazo.com/5d0d5b0e213d72f66144baa6f68417b7/thumb/1000" alt="image"/></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We don’t need so many, so we bundle them up and make them smaller.</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="https://gyazo.com/9bf1b943137d48e4f12b8d6da81eca68/thumb/1000" alt="image"/></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In fact, in the final 30-minute version of the presentation material, the self-introduction was changed to one line</p>
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Introducing myself: I recently read a paper on image generation AI and its source code and tinkered with the contents.</p>

<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>I have three more names, but it’s time to go, so I think I’ll end with this one.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you have any questions so far?</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>Is it correct to say that “we should create our own style of KJ method and share it” is based on the KJ method?</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>The concept of “base KJ method” is pretty vague, isn’t it?
<ul>
<li>Where is the “base” part of the “base KJ method?”</li>
<li>I have a friend who thinks in Excel, using cut-and-paste to collect and move related things close together (<a href="./Excel-based-KJ-method" class="internal alias" data-slug="Excel-based-KJ-method">Excel-based KJ method</a>), and I think of this as the KJ method.</li>
<li>The outliner’s favorite.
<ul>
<li>Write it down in a gulp.</li>
<li>The Outliner can fold up the tree, you know.”</li>
<li>So, we can write a summary of the child’s content at the parent of the tree, and then fold the tree to organize the concepts.”</li>
<li>This is a KJ method grouping, I think.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I think this level of “essence” or “principle of intellectual production” is useful, but as for whether or not to arrange stickies in two dimensions, I don’t think it’s a MUST.
<ul>
<li>I don’t think it’s always a necessary factor when it comes to “does it produce effects as a method of intellectual production?”</li>
<li>I have not yet been able to verbalize when a two-dimensional arrangement is necessary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It is not yet clear which parts are the important essences for the intellectual production techniques to be effective.</li>
<li>I don’t think we’ll know until we become more mature about comparing many different methods and talking about what the commonalities are in this and that.</li>
<li>For example.
<ul>
<li>Like the idea that “all data is false” and “by synthesizing false data, we can get closer to the truth.”</li>
<li>Or the idea that “whether a conclusion is correct or not is not something you can figure out at your desk, but something that should be verified through action.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I have a feeling that this kind of thinking is the essence of what is important.
<ul>
<li>Not specific methods.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>I think that creating your own style is good for the person who creates it, but if you share it, “it would be nice if other people could use it, too.
<ul>
<li>As more and more self-styles are shared, the question becomes, “What is better about method B compared to method A?</li>
<li>If it is not verbalized, it will be like the idea technique: “There are a lot of unknowns,” and “I don’t know which one is better.</li>
<li>I think it would be better for the users if there is an “essence” or “base method” and the differences can be compared for each method, such as “I modified this part from there.
<ul>
<li>I thought it would be very interesting if I could support the “breaking” part of <a href="./Shuhari" class="internal" data-slug="Shuhari">Shuhari</a> well!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>When I heard that, I thought, I guess we need to have a lot of our own methods and then we need to have a “<a href="./Map" class="internal" data-slug="Map">Map</a>” for our own methods.
<ul>
<li>I still haven’t figured out what the “main road” is or anything like that yet.</li>
<li>You seem to think there are several “main paths”.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Also, the accessibility of the tools is very important when they are used by others.
<ul>
<li>The KJ method became popular because it could be done with Post-It instead of “I will buy Jiro Kawakita’s labels from Kawakita Institute.</li>
<li>In this workshop, we used Miro, but I wonder if we could have done the same thing with paper before Miro was born.</li>
<li>Availability of available tools will be a major factor.</li>
<li>I hope Kozaneba can be released with a more user-friendly look, but it’s a bit of a compromise with my development resources, so we’ll see how it goes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>No, but I thought the overall message was something I could really relate to, so thank you!</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>I didn’t realize how important it was to “draw the line” when I created Kozaneba.
<ul>
<li>The best part of creating Kozaneba may have been the verbalization of “a line is necessary.</li>
<li>Related: <a href="./Why-are-lines-essential" class="internal alias" data-slug="Why-are-lines-essential">Why are lines essential?</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
