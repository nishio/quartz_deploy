<ul>
<li>Earlier, a study session was held within Cybozu using the same lecture material.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2022-11-16 Meeting It was decided that the lecture material would be a short version of 30 minutes</li>

<li>Purpose of this time
<ul>
<li>There has been a lot of development in the four months between the time of the August study session and now.</li>
<li>Reflecting on the differences</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>2022-12-02 Day of the event</p>
<ul>
<li>Something pretty interesting happened.
<ul>
<li>The only pre-assignment was to make 25 labels and read the lecture material.
<ul>
<li>However, when I looked on the morning of the day, I saw that about 20 people who had learned how to do it from the lecture materials had started to make a net.</li>
<li>Very active, proactive and good</li>
<li>Has the fact that everyone‚Äôs work status is shared in Miro had a positive impact?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I went around with my comments as of this morning because there is no benefit to procrastination.

<ul>
<li>In retrospect, this was a very good case study collection.</li>
<li>Individuals are starting in advance and rounding up where appropriate.</li>
<li>So many of them are in a ‚Äústate of crispness‚Äù and ‚Äústumbling hands‚Äù compared to what I look around and observe in real time during the workshop!</li>

<ul>
<li>This was also very good.
<ul>
<li>We were able to have 45 people in parallel, which is difficult to do in a physical event.</li>
<li>There‚Äôs a psychological resistance to raising your hand and asking questions in a real setting.
<ul>
<li>‚ÜíWriting in Slack is less psychologically burdensome because you don‚Äôt get so much attention from people around you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(The Nishio side is always in full operation, so there is a heavy burden.)</li>

<li>I have a record of everything we‚Äôve discussed, including taking screen shots.</li>
<li>It‚Äôs been a very good resource.</li>

</li>
<li>The problem that people around you stop and try to listen to you when you communicate with them by voice in a physical setting.
<ul>
<li>Since it was a chat, that didn‚Äôt happen either (probably).</li>

</ul>
<p>Early, Middle, and Late</p>
<ul>
<li>Jiro Kawakita‚Äôs ideas have changed over the past 20 years.
<ul>
<li>This is par for the course.
<ul>
<li>Jiro Kawakita was a smart man who could learn from new experiences and update his ideas.</li>
<li>It would be even stranger if the idea hadn‚Äôt changed for 20 years.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>But ‚Äúthinking‚Äù naturally changes over a 20-year period, and the ‚Äúlong time span‚Äù ‚Äúchanging and dynamic worldview‚Äù was not well shared.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Three epochal books have been published at approximately 10-year intervals
<ul>
<li>First semester 1967 ‚ÄúIdea method‚Äù</li>
<li>Mid 1977 ‚ÄúExploratory Studies of Knowledge‚Äù</li>
<li>Late 1988 ‚ÄúKJ Method: Let Chaos Speak for Itself‚Äù</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>These three books were called the ‚ÄúEarly, Middle, and Late Periods.‚Äù
<ul>
<li>This apparently made it easier to imagine Jiro Kawakita‚Äôs thoughts changing and evolving.
<ul>
<li>With a name to point to [The world that was a blur has been carved out.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How was the last fiscal year?
<ul>
<li>1967 Publication of ‚ÄúIdeas‚Äù.</li>
<li>The first prerequisite is to have a huge amount of routine data.
<ul>
<li>How to summarize the vast amount of qualitative data
<ul>
<li>Categorizing and organizing routine data by homogeneity does not make it ‚Äúcohesive‚Äù.</li>
<li>How to synthesize heterogeneous data is important (p. 53).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>~ and proposed a methodology for</li>
<li>In Nishio‚Äôs lecture, to clearly distinguish the KJ method at this point, he referred to it as the ‚ÄúKJ method of the beginning.‚Äù</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What happened in the mid-term
<ul>
<li>1977 ‚Äú<a href="./Exploratory-Studies-of-Knowledge" class="internal alias" data-slug="Exploratory-Studies-of-Knowledge">Exploratory Studies of Knowledge</a>‚Äù published.</li>
<li>He says something like, ‚ÄúI thought the KJ method was the bottleneck, but the bottleneck was not the KJ method but the interview phase before the KJ method‚Äù (p. 28).
<ul>
<li>If the quality of the data collected in the first place is poor, the quality of the results of the KJ method is also poor (p. 29).</li>
<li>He insisted that the interview phase in front of the KJ method needs to be improved.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Expedition Net] is created by applying KJ legal ideas.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What will happen in the second half of the year
<ul>
<li>1988 ‚ÄúKJ method: Let the chaos speak for itself.‚Äù</li>
<li>Starting with no data, the idea of ‚Äú<a href="./Fireworks-to-think-about" class="internal alias" data-slug="Fireworks-to-think-about">Fireworks to think about</a>‚Äù becomes clear.</li>
<li>Positioning ‚ÄúExplore-Net-Fireworks‚Äù as the ‚Äútwin brother of the KJ method‚Äù and the ‚Äúpractical application of the KJ method.‚Äù</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What does a quick bird‚Äôs eye view of this trend mean in comparison?
<ul>
<li>Last term: large amount of information already exists ‚ÄúKJ method of beginnings‚Äù</li>
<li>Mid-term: Focus on ways to gather information</li>
<li>Late: I generate new information ‚ÄúThinking Fireworks‚Äù</li>
<li>The basic premise of the last term was that [* a large amount of information was already available
<ul>
<li>In reality, however, when I actually tried to teach various people, I found that the ‚Äúassumption of a large amount of information‚Äù was not correct in the first place.</li>
<li>In the medium term, it becomes ‚ÄúWe need to gather information first, right?</li>
<li>What is the first step in the process of gathering that information?
<ul>
<li>First do a thorough <a href="./interior-exploration" class="internal alias" data-slug="interior-exploration">interior exploration</a> and put into words what you think the problem is, what you want it to be, and what you think should be done to solve it.</li>
<li>It‚Äôs going to be that you need to be in a place where you generate new information.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In retrospect, I see that ‚ÄúI create new information‚Äù was also done in the ‚ÄúHow to summarize a lot of data‚Äù phase of the ‚ÄúBeginning KJ Method‚Äù.
<ul>
<li>Jiro Kawakita realized after trying to put it together and not being able to put it together (Idea method, p. 54) that it is important that he creates even when putting it together.</li>
<li>This realization later became a system called the KJ method</li>
<li>In other words, ‚Äúputting together‚Äù is actually closely coupled with ‚Äúconceiving.
<ul>
<li>That‚Äôs why the result of thinking about ‚Äúhow to organize‚Äù is published under the name of ‚ÄúIdea Method‚Äù and explained in a chapter called ‚ÄúKJ Method for Promoting Ideas.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Any questions so far?</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>How is the latter term ‚ÄúI generate new information‚Äù used in situations like mobile universities and fieldwork?
<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>If we apply Jiro Kawakita‚Äôs concept in the mid-term, you say, ‚ÄúWe need <a href="./Interior-Exploration" class="internal alias" data-slug="Interior-Exploration">Interior Exploration</a> before we start the interview.
<ul>
<li>There is a phase where I first explore my mind and clarify ‚Äúwhat needs to be covered in the future‚Äù.</li>
<li>It‚Äôs like it became a firework to think about.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>Okay. Thank you very much.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>What kind of image do you have, Nishio-san?
<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>The former.
<ul>
<li>Jiro Kawakita, who was able to do well and already had data that he had collected through interviews, did not understand that people in the world were stumped on how to collect data.</li>
<li>You don‚Äôt know because you haven‚Äôt experienced it yourself.</li>
<li>So I released a book called ‚ÄúHow to Think‚Äù about what I did with the ‚Äúdata after I collected it‚Äù.</li>
<li>Over the next 10 years or so, Jiro Kawakita gained experience in teaching by being asked by various people, ‚ÄúPlease teach me this KJ method.</li>
<li>Then I realized that the data was wrong in the first place, and that many people stumble here.</li>
<li>So in the mid-term, with the ‚Äúexploratory study of knowledge,‚Äù we‚Äôre talking about ‚Äúwe need to do a better job of collecting data, right?‚Äù</li>
<li>Jiro Kawakita‚Äôs ideas developed as a result of his new experiences.</li>
<li>So ‚Äúif you are in the same situation as in the previous period, you can of course continue to use the same method as in the previous period‚Äù!</li>
<li>Jiro Kawakita realized that there are various situations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>Okay, so if you get the interview part right in a way like the Exploration Net, then you can use the ‚ÄúBeginning KJ method‚Äù to summarize and generate ideas.</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Yes, yes, that‚Äôs the image I have.
<ul>
<li>Let me explain from another angle.</li>
<li>Jiro Kawakita was unaware of the necessary conditions to do the ‚ÄúKJ method of beginnings‚Äù the way he did in the previous period.</li>
<li>As I was teaching the KJ method, I realized I needed good coverage.</li>
<li>That‚Äôs why we built an expedition net in the mid-term.</li>
<li>Jiro Kawakita was unaware of the necessary conditions to make that expedition net work.
<ul>
<li>While teaching exploratory net,

<li>Jiro Kawakita viewed the data that way, based on this,</li>
<li>Can I add my own thoughts that come to mind while I‚Äôm doing the KJ method?‚Äù Answer the question ‚ÄúYes.
<ul>
<li>First of all, [anything that comes to mind should be recorded.
- [If you don‚Äôt record it, it disappears.
<ul>
<li>What you come up with could be beneficial.
<ul>
<li>It could prove beneficial later.</li>
<li>It would be a shame to keep it only in your head and let it disappear.</li>
<li>So we should record it first.</li>

<li>This is ‚Äúdata‚Äù of course, since it is ‚Äúdata of my thoughts observed and recorded‚Äù.</li>

<li>Either you mix this data right now or you don‚Äôt.
<ul>
<li>You can mix it right up.</li>
<li>You can keep it close by and focus on sorting through the data that came in from the outside first.</li>
<li>Earlier, I asked, ‚ÄúAre you going to distinguish them with a mark or something?‚Äù There was a question
<ul>
<li>You can make a distinction, you don‚Äôt have to make a distinction, just do whichever suits your purpose.</li>
<li>When it‚Äôs a ‚Äúdecide what I‚Äôm going to do next‚Äù type of firework to think about, there‚Äôs not much need to distinguish between the two.</li>
<li>I think some people want to distinguish between their opinions and the data collected when it comes to ‚Äúcompiling a report that separates my opinions from the data collected.‚Äù
<ul>
<li>However, in this day and age, if the data collected is digital, it is easy to find out where it came from by searching, and I think there is little need for humans to mark labels and do their best to distinguish between the two.</li>

<li>It‚Äôs like, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs so much information out there, it‚Äôs a mess, how do I organize it?‚Äù

<li>Jiro Kawakita had trouble with this before he created the KJ method, as described in ‚ÄúIdea Method,‚Äù p. 52.</li>

<li>It‚Äôs not productive to dwell on ‚Äúwhat should I do‚Ä¶‚Äù at this time.

<li>Nothing is going ahead.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Worse yet, ‚ÄúThere are some parts that are organized and some messes that aren‚Äôt. Let‚Äôs just use the parts that are organized.‚Äù
<ul>
<li>This is so bad.</li>
<li>for some reason

<li>Where it was organized quickly, where it matched existing thinking, existing <a href="./frame-of-mind" class="internal alias" data-slug="frame-of-mind">frame of mind</a>.

<li>Why?
- <a href="./Existing-Structure" class="internal alias" data-slug="Existing-Structure">Existing Structure</a> boundaries prevent the discovery of new structures.
- The boundaries represented by this ‚Äúeldest daughter‚Äù circle get in the way of discovering new associations.

<li>For example, I wonder if there could have been an option ‚ÄúPlease collect things you find interesting‚Äù ( <a href="./KJ-method-of-amusing" class="internal alias" data-slug="KJ-method-of-amusing">KJ method of amusing</a> , <a href="./The-&quot;Interesting&quot;-Exploration-Net" class="internal alias" data-slug="The-&quot;Interesting&quot;-Exploration-Net">The ‚ÄúInteresting‚Äù Exploration Net</a> ).</li>
<li>I do think there was room for improvement in the theming, the quality of the labels was affected by the theming, and people seem to be stumped by that.</li>
<li>Free‚Ä¶
<ul>
<li>Many people were so entrenched in the idea that there was a ‚Äúright way (of doing things).‚Äù</li>
<li>No, I said, ‚ÄúYou can use it more <a href="./*freedom" class="internal" data-slug="*freedom">*freedom</a> for whatever you want to think about,‚Äù and I asked him to bring me something to think about, but‚Ä¶</li>

<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>What was your goal in choosing ‚Äúsomething that seems to have the right answer?‚Äù
<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Not ‚Äúwhat the right answer is likely to be,‚Äù but ‚Äúwhat the right answer is likely to be <a href="./within" class="internal" data-slug="within">within</a> me.‚Äù
<ul>
<li>If you bring a theme that is ‚Äúsomething for which the correct answer has been decided in a place that is not yours,‚Äù I would say, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs not think about it here, let‚Äôs go to the site and observe it.</li>
<li>It is not a direction of consciousness to observe one‚Äôs own mind closely.</li>
<li>I‚Äôd look out.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>Do you want me to look inside and do something that I might have the answer to?</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>So. Maybe I should have been a little more specific and said something like, ‚ÄúSomething that seems to be getting closer to an answer by taking a closer look inside myself.‚Äù</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>Difficult!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>The KJ method case study I saw was on the subject of ‚ÄúWhat is valuable to you?‚Äù
<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>I see
<ul>
<li>I knew that ‚Äúvalue <a href="./for-me" class="internal alias" data-slug="for-me">for me</a>‚Äù and so on.</li>
<li>Like, ‚ÄúWhat do you find interesting <a href="./to-you" class="internal alias" data-slug="to-you">to you</a>?‚Äù</li>
<li>Maybe I should have been more explicit about that sort of thing.</li>
<li>When I saw that they put ‚Äúobservation‚Äù in the middle, I was like, ‚ÄúOh (>_&lt;).‚Äù
<ul>
<li>You‚Äôre already thinking abstractly when you set up this theme.</li>
<li>I feel that when you set a theme of ‚ÄúOkay, let‚Äôs KJ about observations‚Äù instead of something specific, I feel like ‚ÄúNo, you‚Äôre talking a lot <a href="./have-no-roots" class="internal alias" data-slug="have-no-roots">have no roots</a>.‚Äù</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Another example was someone who had a theme like ‚ÄúI‚Äôll have an anniversary vacation soon, what shall I do?‚Äù and I think that was a good, specific theme.
<ul>
<li>It‚Äôs, ‚Äú<a href="./*I-am" class="internal alias" data-slug="*I-am">*I am</a> what I want.‚Äù</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The rest were deep in thought about ‚Äúhow I will live my life.‚Äù
<ul>
<li>I found it interesting in terms of the theme itself, but I‚Äôm commenting on the ‚Äúform‚Äù of the theme, and I don‚Äôt want to get too deep into a discussion of the specifics of the theme, so I didn‚Äôt dig too deep into it.</li>
<li>(Tip: In one-on-one or small group situations, I may be the one to listen to the ‚Äúverbal explanation of the group‚Äôs content‚Äù and then ask a <a href="./Clean-Question" class="internal alias" data-slug="Clean-Question">Clean Question</a>. I do not give my opinion when ‚Äúteaching the KJ method,‚Äù but if we have a relationship where <a href="./Undesirable-Compromise" class="internal alias" data-slug="Undesirable-Compromise">Undesirable Compromise</a> does not occur, I may share my opinion.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>I thought it was interesting that there was such freedom to set various themes.</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>I‚Äôm sorry for him in this case study 8, but I learned a lesson from the observation that ‚Äúif you give a theme complete freedom, some people will rub you the wrong way in the theme-setting stage.‚Äù
<ul>
<li>I needed to limit the scope of the topic a bit more and give some direction.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>PS: In organizing this Q&amp;A conversation, I noticed that all of the ‚Äúgood‚Äù themes included ‚ÄúI am‚Äù and ‚Äúfor me‚Äù. It seems that ‚Äú<a href="./personal-affair" class="internal alias" data-slug="personal-affair">personal affair</a>‚Äù is an important direction.</li>

<ul>
<li>People who‚Äôve been there will say, ‚ÄúOf course they do.‚Äù</li>
<li>People who haven‚Äôt experienced it will say, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about.</li>
<li>There was no verbalization of what exactly ‚Äúawareness‚Äù meant.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This time, we have a clear, concrete example.</li>
<li>Realization that ‚Äúthis is something relevant, although it is placed far away now.‚Äù
<ul>
<li>
<p>This time, the action of ‚Äúdrawing a line‚Äù was added to the ‚Äúexploration net‚Äù origin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This led to frequent cases of lines being drawn between ‚Äúlabels placed at a distance‚Äù.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><img src="https://gyazo.com/bbb7b6791477bbe1c73160b6506f76ca/thumb/1000" alt="image"/></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is ‚Äúawareness.‚Äù</p>
<ul>
<li>Before the lines were drawn, I thought ‚Äúthe two are unrelated.‚Äù
<ul>
<li>That‚Äôs why I put them apart.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>But after the fact, I thought, ‚ÄúThere seems to be a relationship between the two.‚Äù
<ul>
<li>So the line was drawn.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The timing when this line is drawn is the timing of ‚Äúawareness‚Äù.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What does the KJ method without lines do in such a situation?</p>
<ul>
<li>The way to express that ‚Äúawareness‚Äù was to ‚Äúmove it closer.</li>
<li>This destroys the ‚Äúpre-aware‚Äù ‚Äú<a href="./assumed-frame-of-mind" class="internal alias" data-slug="assumed-frame-of-mind">assumed frame of mind</a>‚Äù and a new structure emerges.</li>
<li>However, we tend to feel psychological resistance to this ‚Äúmovement with destruction
<ul>
<li>Priority is given to ‚Äúobjectively correct,‚Äù ‚Äúknown structures,‚Äù and ‚Äúhierarchical organization.‚Äù</li>
<li>Ignoring or downplaying my subjective feeling of ‚Äúthis and that seem to be related‚Äù.</li>
<li>But that feeling is more important.
<ul>
<li>Brain structures that I had in my mind before I saw the actual data.
<ul>
<li>Assumption that this is the way it would be</li>
<li>So this is not looking at the data.</li>
<li>So that‚Äôs what I thought before I looked at the data.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The structure ‚Äúbefore‚Äù looking at the data and what you realize is related to this and that ‚Äúafter‚Äù looking at the data.
<ul>
<li>The latter realization is naturally more important</li>
<li>We need to change the value system that says</li>

<p>How about Jiro Kawakita‚Äôs original expedition net</p>

<li>I was not using a digital tool that allows me to draw lines of any length.</li>
<li>The relationship was ‚Äúclipped.‚Äù

</ul>
</li>
<li>As a result, the only way to keep things relevant was to keep them close together.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>By using the Miro digital tool, I can now draw lines from a distance.</p>
<ul>
<li>Can express ‚Äúrelevant‚Äù without psychological resistance, even if it is far away.
<ul>
<li>This is good.
<ul>
<li>The bar has been lowered.</li>
<li>Information that ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt verbalize in words, but I think it‚Äôs relevant‚Äù can be recorded.</li>
<li>Output, out of the mind, can be made indelible.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On the other hand, it‚Äôs now possible to ‚Äúleave it far away‚Äù.
<ul>
<li>The freedom of digital tools has allowed for bad expression.</li>
<li>There were a lot of lines drawn, and people were getting crossed all over the place and messed up, and they were like, ‚ÄúWhat am I supposed to do?‚Äù</li>
<li>I couldn‚Äôt have made that kind of crossing when I was expressing it with a clip.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lines drawn later are more important because they are ‚Äúnewly noticed‚Äù.</li>
<li>You can move the label around to shorten the line.</li>
<li>(Jiro Kawakita is opposed to moving it on a large scale. This is where Nishio and I disagree, and it will become clear in the future what this disagreement stems from. (Opposition to the Great Migration of Peoples], to be written in the future.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can take care of the anxiety of destruction with ‚Äújust copy and keep it.</p>

<li>Once the current mess is copied and set aside (you can go back to it if you want).</li>

<li>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>This ‚Äúbreaking the structure‚Äù could be done in such a way that a human does it until the line is drawn, and once the line is drawn, the system breaks the structure for you.</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>It is technically possible to formulate a spring model, for example, from the state where this line is drawn.</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>If we break them down, it may lead to the discovery of a new human structure, saying, ‚ÄúThis kind of structure exists.</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Yes, indeed.
<ul>
<li>In fact, we have tried auto-shaping with a spring model, and the reason why we are not doing it now is because ‚Äúit is irritating when the auto-shaping moves the position while a human is placing the model‚Äù.</li>
<li>It‚Äôs irritating because it‚Äôs ‚Äúdestruction in the making‚Äù to be moved by the system when humans are ‚Äúexpressing by arrangement what has not yet been put into words‚Äù.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>I see</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>I just had this discussion and thought that if I had a ‚Äúbackup of the current version so that I could go back to it,‚Äù then the machine could change the arrangement.

<li>It‚Äôs not that difficult to reshape this with a spring model after all of these things are connected.</li>
<li>Actually, Kozaneba already has the code to format it with the spring model, the menu is just disabled.</li>

<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>You generate a force that brings you closer together between things connected by lines, and then you apply a repulsive force against this individual block.

<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>You draw one line to make it, and then you take all the lines and shuffle them around and make another one, so you can see it on a different axis.</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>It‚Äôs probably hard on the human heart to shuffle it around and do it again.</li>

<li>PS: After we talked, I checked and this episode is in <a href="./Examples-of-Group-Formation-Failures" class="internal alias" data-slug="Examples-of-Group-Formation-Failures">Examples of Group Formation Failures</a>. I went a little overboard.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>I don‚Äôt know what I would do if I were you, I‚Äôd put it to bed and start over again when I forgot about it.</p>

<ul>
<li>And we need to talk about that ‚Äú<a href="./ferment" class="internal" data-slug="ferment">ferment</a>.‚Äù</li>
<li>It‚Äôs totally fine to leave things lying around that don‚Äôt come together at a certain point.</li>
<li>You let them sleep on it, forget about it for a week, for example, and come back to it after doing another job.</li>
<li>Then, once you look at the Internet with a reset head and newly input knowledge, you will see the following.
<ul>
<li>I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄúOh, there‚Äôs a connection between here and here.‚Äù</li>
<li>I‚Äôll say something like, ‚ÄúThat thing I saw on another job I was working on recently leads to this label.‚Äù</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>So it happens that labels are added, lines are added.</li>
<li>As the number of ‚Äúexpressed realizations‚Äù increases in this way, we gradually begin to see a form.</li>
<li>So I think it‚Äôs quite beneficial to put the net down for a week and look at it again!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>Okay, I can see that as a realization.</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>I‚Äôve given lectures and then a year later I‚Äôm asked to speak again on a similar topic, and I‚Äôve done things like reuse lecture materials and create other lecture materials.
<ul>
<li>I have a feeling that it is quite beneficial to take lecture materials that have been sitting for a year, put them back together again in fragments, add new information, and reconstruct them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>I can relate to that, and I do too.
<ul>
<li>I only remember the important stuff and forget the details, which is a nice touch.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>For example, if you try to reuse something that is left in detail in the form of a text, and you try to reuse it well, what you had ‚Äúbefore you read it‚Äù will wipe out at the time you are reading it.
<ul>
<li>There is a more favorable feeling to reconstruct from information that is so rough that the associative network of sticky notes is connected.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>In terms of reconfiguration, maybe so.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>As for the first question When you first put down a sticky note, you put it down as you put it up‚Äù, there are two ways to do it, as far as whether you put down the labels sequentially or not.</p>
<ul>
<li>What I really wanted to do this time was ‚Äújust have a label for the theme in the middle and add what I associate with it.</li>
<li>But I thought if we did that, we wouldn‚Äôt have enough time.</li>
<li>So I gave him the advice, ‚ÄúWrite 25 labels in advance.‚Äù</li>
<li>There was a sense that this caused confusion.</li>
<li>If we were to do it a second time.
<ul>
<li>Write the theme on the middle label.</li>
<li>Prepare 25 labels according to the following procedure: 1.
<ul>
<li>Create labels by association with the labels they are placed on.</li>
<li>Draw a line with the source of the association and leave it there.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To keep the shape of everything connected.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I think it would be good to do something like</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>Did you originally want to do a thinking fireworks type thing?</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>That‚Äôs right.
<ul>
<li>The real ‚Äúthinking fireworks‚Äù have a theme in the middle and are increased by association from scratch.</li>
<li>But for some people, that phase seems to take a long time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>Yes, they have to come out.</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>There are people who get stuck, or who spend half an hour writing only 10 pages.
<ul>
<li>And if that happens, you can‚Äôt do the later phases, if they say there are only 10 sheets.</li>
<li>So the risk is crazy high for a workshop with limited time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>I see</li>

<li>When I observed the people I worked with beforehand, there were a lot of ‚Äúpeople who were not connected to the central theme and were doing the KJ method that they were used to, with the theme in the middle,‚Äù so I thought there might have been a better way to give them guidance.</li>

<p>Parable of the Bicycle</p>
<ul>
<li>It‚Äôs not something taught in words.‚Äù</li>
<li>Skills acquired through repetitive practice in a safe environment.‚Äù</li>
<li>It‚Äôs not about whether it‚Äôs right, it‚Äôs about whether the bike moves forward.‚Äù</li>
<li>This metaphor was further developed in the process of reworking the lecture material.</li>
<li>To ‚Äúmove forward‚Äù is to ‚Äúrealize something you didn‚Äôt realize before.‚Äù
<ul>
<li>Pedaling a bicycle with the stand up does not move it forward.
<ul>
<li>It looks like ‚Äúriding a bike‚Äù but it‚Äôs not.</li>
<li>No amount of that is going to make me learn to ride a bike.</li>
<li>Actually, it‚Äôs not just the pedals steering wheel operation is important (see below).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Parable of the Two Riders
<ul>
<li>Why it doesn‚Äôt work when there are seniors and juniors and [authoritarian gradient</li>
<li>It‚Äôs like a two-seater.
<ul>
<li>Seniors hold the wheel, seniors pedal.</li>
<li>Lots of two-person rides won‚Äôt help juniors learn to ride a bike.</li>
<li>I have to hold the handlebars and pedal by myself.</li>
<li>‚ÄúI take the wheel‚Äù = I make the decisions about what direction to go.</li>
<li>I pedal‚Äù = I generate the energy to move forward.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The problem of ‚Äúfast people‚Äù who sass up appearances without much thought.
<ul>
<li>It‚Äôs like buzzing around on the pedals with the bike stand up.</li>
<li>It‚Äôs just spinning faster because it‚Äôs not under load ([Parable of the Gears).</li>
<li>Doing that doesn‚Äôt move you forward, it doesn‚Äôt give you new insights.</li>

<li>What is this ‚Äúone job‚Äù?
<ul>
<li>It is not ‚Äúwork‚Äù that you are told to do by your boss.</li>
<li>To determine what and how you can get good fruit by yourself and do it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>By tasting its fruits, you will become more confident in your ‚Äújudgment.</li>
<li>This process is important.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In other words, this is ‚Äúdecision-making‚Äù in a ‚Äúsituation where the correct answer is not given from the outside.
<ul>
<li>No ‚Äúthis is the way to do it‚Äù given.</li>
<li>People who are used to working according to a given policy feel insecure.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When trying to compile data collected from outside
<ul>
<li>The right answer to ‚Äúhow to put it all together‚Äù is not given from the outside.
<ul>
<li>If the correct answer is known, there is no point in going through the costly process of ‚Äúcollecting data and making a decision‚Äù.</li>
<li>We do it because the right answer is unknown, and this is the basic premise.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The right answer can‚Äôt be given to you from the outside, so you have to create your own.
<ul>
<li>If you work hard enough to do what you can assemble from the data alone, but you can‚Äôt move on, then you need to make decisions to move on from there.</li>
<li>You hold the steering wheel and make a decision, ‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôm going this way,‚Äù and then you press the pedal yourself to move forward.</li>

<li>This is how the ‚Äúbicycle metaphor‚Äù has become so matchedu

<li>There is a client, there is a time limit, and if you don‚Äôt get it into shape and out by the allotted time, or if the quality of what you put out is not good enough, the client or senior staff might get angry, but ‚Äúwhat is the right answer‚Äù is not given.</li>

<p>(I only talked about part of this page because I had little time.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2018, when I wrote <a href="./The-Intellectual-Production-of-Engineers" class="internal alias" data-slug="The-Intellectual-Production-of-Engineers">The Intellectual Production of Engineers</a>, I asked, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you give this intellectual production technique a name like the KJ method?‚Äù I was asked.</p>
<ul>
<li>I said, ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt name names.‚Äù
<ul>
<li>Deliberately avoided naming names from the time of writing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>for some reason
<ul>
<li>This manuscript was written in 2017.
<ul>
<li>I wrote the book thinking, ‚ÄúThe paper method is useful, but it has a number of problems, it needs to be electronic.‚Äù</li>
<li>No digital tool had yet satisfied me.</li>
<li>After the writing was done, we started developing digital tools.
<ul>
<li>This led to the current [Kozaneba digital stationery to organize your thoughts</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I think in retrospect that at the time I was writing it, I had the feeling that the way I was doing it at the moment was not the finished version.</li>

<ul>
<li>I told him, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs make our own style,‚Äù and ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good to exchange information about our own style.‚Äù</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: <a href="./name-your-own-style" class="internal alias" data-slug="name-your-own-style">name your own style</a> and might be easier to distribute/exchange?</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>And I thought, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right.‚Äù</li>
<li>for some reason
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>It makes sense to create a <a href="./lingua-franca" class="internal alias" data-slug="lingua-franca">lingua franca</a> to share within the organization, but as a preliminary step, it might be a good idea to secretly give your methods a personal name (<a href="./Personal-words" class="internal alias" data-slug="Personal-words">Personal words</a>).</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Unnamed concepts are like liquid, elusive and difficult to manipulate</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Naming the concept allows us to manipulate it with a handle, like coffee in a mug (<a href="./Metaphor-of-liquid-in-a-container" class="internal alias" data-slug="Metaphor-of-liquid-in-a-container">Metaphor of liquid in a container</a>).</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>The first step before creating a common language is to give a personal name to your method.</li>
<li>It is easier to manipulate than unnamed concepts</li>
<li>By naming a concept, you turn that concept into an object that can be manipulated and handled with a handle, like ‚Äúliquid is in a container.‚Äù</li>
<li>This is the story I wrote in <a href="./The-Intellectual-Production-of-Engineers" class="internal alias" data-slug="The-Intellectual-Production-of-Engineers">The Intellectual Production of Engineers</a> p.36 [(Column) To name the pattern.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compare with 2018 decisions</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing in a book with a name‚Äù is the equivalent of creating ‚Äúa common language shared around the world.‚Äù</li>
<li>The 2018 decision ‚Äúnot at the stage of naming names‚Äù is ‚Äúnot at the stage of creating a common language.‚Äù</li>
<li>Giving a ‚Äúprivate name‚Äù as a preliminary step is beneficial</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>So I gave a tentative name to Nishio‚Äôs own style.</p>

<p><a href="./Presentation-Story-Construction-Method" class="internal alias" data-slug="Presentation-Story-Construction-Method">Presentation Story Construction Method</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is literally the method we use to create the presentation story</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>KJ method combined with [knee-swing (gymnastics)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fragments of a story are told as stickies, and related stickies are connected to each other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sticky notes are placed in close proximity or connected by lines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ones we‚Äôve determined we‚Äôre going to talk about in this order, we‚Äôre going to group them in close proximity and lump them together.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is Kozaneba and can be folded up.</li>
<li>If you decide to quit, just ungroup.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The process of sticking things together to make them stick is the equivalent of stapling in the Kozane method.</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="https://gyazo.com/3f79670a7f18423e3c645f0effa41bcd/thumb/1000" alt="image"/> <a href="./The-Art-of-Intellectual-Production" class="internal alias" data-slug="The-Art-of-Intellectual-Production">The Art of Intellectual Production</a> p.204</li>
<li>In the Kozane method, when you think ‚Äúthis is how the story goes,‚Äù you staple it together into a single chunk.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Roughly, it‚Äôs like starting at the top left and finishing at the bottom right.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, a sticky note introducing oneself is placed in the upper left corner.</li>
<li>If there is group work after the lecture, the explanation of how to proceed goes on the bottom right.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most of the rest of the stickies are pulled into place by lines and stuff.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>Why not start in the middle?</p>
<ul>
<li>I think the one by Loftwork started in the middle.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>When creating lecture materials from scratch, we sometimes do a divergence phase with the theme in the middle, like <a href="./Fireworks-to-think-about" class="internal alias" data-slug="Fireworks-to-think-about">Fireworks to think about</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>On the other hand, the real value of this method is when you already have the materials.
<ul>
<li>I‚Äôm told that there are past presentation materials that need to be changed in their structure.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There is a ‚Äúback-and-forth adjacency‚Äù between ‚Äúalready written out sentences and presentations.‚Äù</li>
<li>Already in a state where the connection between the material and its</li>
<li>I use this when I want to reuse it.</li>
<li>So in most cases, the material is already there.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>Can we have a general outline, like speaking in this order, and extend it from the upper left to the lower right?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>It‚Äôs a situation where the general framework is set but needs to be changed.</p>

</ul>
</li>
<li>When we decided to do a 30-minute lecture on the one-hour version of the KJ method, we rearranged the materials and said, ‚ÄúWell, let‚Äôs see what we can cut out.</li>
<li>For example, the self-introduction was about this much on the original slide.

<p>We don‚Äôt need so many, so we bundle them up and make them smaller.</p>

<p>In fact, in the final 30-minute version of the presentation material, the self-introduction was changed to one line</p>

<li>Do you have any questions so far?</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>Is it correct to say that ‚Äúwe should create our own style of KJ method and share it‚Äù is based on the KJ method?</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>The concept of ‚Äúbase KJ method‚Äù is pretty vague, isn‚Äôt it?
<ul>
<li>Where is the ‚Äúbase‚Äù part of the ‚Äúbase KJ method?‚Äù</li>
<li>I have a friend who thinks in Excel, using cut-and-paste to collect and move related things close together (<a href="./Excel-based-KJ-method" class="internal alias" data-slug="Excel-based-KJ-method">Excel-based KJ method</a>), and I think of this as the KJ method.</li>
<li>The outliner‚Äôs favorite.
<ul>
<li>Write it down in a gulp.</li>
<li>The Outliner can fold up the tree, you know.‚Äù</li>
<li>So, we can write a summary of the child‚Äôs content at the parent of the tree, and then fold the tree to organize the concepts.‚Äù</li>
<li>This is a KJ method grouping, I think.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I think this level of ‚Äúessence‚Äù or ‚Äúprinciple of intellectual production‚Äù is useful, but as for whether or not to arrange stickies in two dimensions, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a MUST.
<ul>
<li>I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs always a necessary factor when it comes to ‚Äúdoes it produce effects as a method of intellectual production?‚Äù</li>
<li>I have not yet been able to verbalize when a two-dimensional arrangement is necessary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It is not yet clear which parts are the important essences for the intellectual production techniques to be effective.</li>
<li>I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll know until we become more mature about comparing many different methods and talking about what the commonalities are in this and that.</li>
<li>For example.
<ul>
<li>Like the idea that ‚Äúall data is false‚Äù and ‚Äúby synthesizing false data, we can get closer to the truth.‚Äù</li>
<li>Or the idea that ‚Äúwhether a conclusion is correct or not is not something you can figure out at your desk, but something that should be verified through action.‚Äù</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I have a feeling that this kind of thinking is the essence of what is important.
<ul>
<li>Not specific methods.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>I think that creating your own style is good for the person who creates it, but if you share it, ‚Äúit would be nice if other people could use it, too.
<ul>
<li>As more and more self-styles are shared, the question becomes, ‚ÄúWhat is better about method B compared to method A?</li>
<li>If it is not verbalized, it will be like the idea technique: ‚ÄúThere are a lot of unknowns,‚Äù and ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know which one is better.</li>
<li>I think it would be better for the users if there is an ‚Äúessence‚Äù or ‚Äúbase method‚Äù and the differences can be compared for each method, such as ‚ÄúI modified this part from there.
<ul>
<li>I thought it would be very interesting if I could support the ‚Äúbreaking‚Äù part of <a href="./Shuhari" class="internal" data-slug="Shuhari">Shuhari</a> well!</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>When I heard that, I thought, I guess we need to have a lot of our own methods and then we need to have a ‚Äú<a href="./Map" class="internal" data-slug="Map">Map</a>‚Äù for our own methods.

<li>I still haven‚Äôt figured out what the ‚Äúmain road‚Äù is or anything like that yet.</li>
<li>You seem to think there are several ‚Äúmain paths‚Äù.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Also, the accessibility of the tools is very important when they are used by others.
<ul>
<li>The KJ method became popular because it could be done with Post-It instead of ‚ÄúI will buy Jiro Kawakita‚Äôs labels from Kawakita Institute.</li>
<li>In this workshop, we used Miro, but I wonder if we could have done the same thing with paper before Miro was born.</li>
<li>Availability of available tools will be a major factor.</li>
<li>I hope Kozaneba can be released with a more user-friendly look, but it‚Äôs a bit of a compromise with my development resources, so we‚Äôll see how it goes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>No, but I thought the overall message was something I could really relate to, so thank you!</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>I didn‚Äôt realize how important it was to ‚Äúdraw the line‚Äù when I created Kozaneba.
<ul>
<li>The best part of creating Kozaneba may have been the verbalization of ‚Äúa line is necessary.</li>
<li>Related: <a href="./Why-are-lines-essential" class="internal alias" data-slug="Why-are-lines-essential">Why are lines essential?</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>Indeed, it‚Äôs great fun to see that kind of trial-and-error process reveal the necessary elements!</li>
</ul>
