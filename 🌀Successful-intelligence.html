<p>From a systems perspective, there are two types of systems: those that augment human intelligence and those that have the ability to augment intelligence themselves. The former provides the means to augment human knowledge and abilities, while the latter can independently improve its own intelligence and abilities.</p>

<p>Successful intelligence refers to the state of utilizing one’s own abilities and pursuing happiness. It is highly motivated by confronting its own weaknesses and overcoming them. There are two types of systems: systems that enhance human intelligence and systems that themselves have the ability to enhance intelligence.</p>
<p>From Nishio’s research notes, it is interesting to note that new ideas are created by combining knowledge, and new combinations are created by incorporating the different knowledge of others. Also important is the perspective that by taking the initiative to help oneself, one can help one’s future self.</p>
<p>Q: What is the difference between systems that enhance human intelligence and systems that themselves have the ability to enhance intelligence? And how do these systems enhance human intelligence?</p>
<p>OPINION: The fact that highly intelligent people can also act foolishly shows that not only intelligence is important, but also character. I also feel it is important to know oneself, face one’s weaknesses, and overcome them. This supports my belief that self-understanding and self-improvement are the keys to forming successful intelligence.</p>
<p>Nishio’s research notes also indicate the idea that new ideas can be generated by combining knowledge. This is consistent with my view that collaboration between people with different perspectives and knowledge has the potential to generate new discoveries and creativity.</p>

Intellectual productivity is the value of the final product per input cost. There is a time delay in the process of increasing the value of an idea. Focus on the productivity of the process. Ideas are replicable resources, identical to existing ideas. Ideas that do not generate enthusiasm on their own are of low value. Ideas are valuable when they are nurtured and refined with effort. It is important to create and sustain a “good state.”</p>
<p>🤖Knowledge
Visualize the lack of learning. Ask whether to learn or leave the decision to those who have learned. Shallow knowledge that was naturally acquired by living long without effort to acquire knowledge. Easily acquired through search. Connected knowledge. Building up knowledge on one’s own. People who assume that correct knowledge is given by authority. The problem when something new appears and there is no textbook as an authority yet.</p>

<p>Successful intelligence refers to the state of utilizing one’s own abilities and pursuing happiness. Highly intelligent people may engage in foolish behavior. They are highly motivated by facing up to their weaknesses and overcoming them. There are two types of systems: systems that enhance human intelligence and systems that themselves have the ability to enhance intelligence. The deeper one’s understanding regarding what situations make one feel happy, the easier it is to acquire happy situations.</p>
<p>From Nishio’s research notes, it is interesting to note that new ideas are created by combining knowledge, and new combinations are created by incorporating the different knowledge of others. Also important is the perspective that by taking the initiative to help oneself, one can help one’s future self.</p>
<p>Q: What is the difference between systems that enhance human intelligence and systems that themselves have the ability to enhance intelligence? And how do these systems enhance human intelligence?</p>
<p>OPINION: The fact that highly intelligent people can also act foolishly shows that not only intelligence is important, but also character. I also feel it is important to know oneself, face one’s weaknesses, and overcome them. This supports my belief that self-understanding and self-improvement are the keys to forming successful intelligence.</p>
<p>Nishio’s research notes also indicate the idea that new ideas can be generated by combining knowledge. This is consistent with my view that collaboration between people with different perspectives and knowledge has the potential to generate new discoveries and creativity.</p>

<p>WHAT UTILITARIANISM IS presents the idea that those who are able to utilize their higher abilities pursue their own well-being. This is consistent with the definition of “successful intelligence” mentioned in my note. Hatena2009-10-03” also states that people are highly motivated by facing up to their weaknesses and overcoming them. This relates to the importance of balancing spontaneity and initiative.</p>
<p>In “Intelligence Enhancing Systems,” two types of systems are proposed: systems that enhance human intelligence and systems that themselves have the capacity to enhance intelligence. This is related to the increase in intellectual productivity discussed in my note.</p>
<p>In “A Deeper Understanding of One’s Happiness Makes It Easier to Obtain,” it is stated that the deeper one’s understanding of what situations make one feel happy, the easier it is to obtain those happy situations.

Successful intelligence refers to the state of utilizing one’s abilities and pursuing happiness. An intelligent being avoids stupidity, while a superior being needs many things. However, those who believe that a superior being is no happier than an inferior being are confusing two different concepts: happiness and contentment. Intellectual productivity requires trial and error in how one utilizes one’s abilities, discovers new information, builds relationships, and enjoys oneself.

Intellectual productivity requires the use of one’s own abilities, the discovery of new information, the building of relationships, and the trial and error of ways to have fun, which can be considered part of “play. A balance of spontaneity and initiative is necessary, and a valuable act is to learn existing knowledge while creating knowledge that fits the situation.</p>
<p>From Nishio’s research notes, we see a discussion of the role of knowledge as a producer and the value of knowledge. Knowledge is outcome-focused information, and its production is immaterial. Learning existing knowledge is beneficial, but that knowledge is replicable and unlikely to lead to differentiation. On the other hand, knowledge produced in the field of application is highly valuable. These perspectives are closely related to my research.</p>
<p>Q: How should we maintain a balance between spontaneity and initiative as producers of knowledge? Also, how should we balance existing knowledge with newly produced knowledge?</p>
<p>From the fragments, it appears that it is important to improve the ability to generate new knowledge, to produce information focused on specific language and output, and on the ability to generate knowledge. These are relevant to my own research. Also important is the perspective of demanding continuous learning from knowledge workers, and of improving their productivity by having them teach others. These perspectives can add new perspectives to my research.</p>

<p>We will discuss the concept of “successful intelligence” and its relevance to intellectual production. Intellectual production refers to “non-material things” and “not consumption”. Since both production and consumption of non-material things are common today, a more detailed analysis is needed. Knowledge is outcome-focused information.</p>
<p>Successful intelligence is the state of being able to utilize one’s own high abilities. Intelligent people do not like to be fools, and those with superior abilities need more to make themselves happy and may experience serious suffering. However, those who believe that superior beings are no happier than inferior beings are confusing two different concepts of happiness and contentment.</p>
<p>The role of knowledge producers will also be discussed. Knowledge production is not just about discovering new information; it is also a process of trial and error in how to build relationships and have a good time. This is included in the broad framework of “play” and is felt as a way of life.</p>
<p>In addition, specific examples and theories will be cited to explore in depth the relationship between knowledge production and successful intelligence. For example, we will refer to related studies such as “Flowers for Algernon” and “Depressive Realism Theory.”</p>
<p>From these considerations, we submit new perspectives and questions about the link between successful intelligence and intellectual production. Further research is needed on what successful intelligence is, how it relates to intellectual production, and how this connection can be deepened.</p>

Nishio's &quot;discomfort-driven intellectual production&quot; and &quot;granularity of information&quot; suggest that combining knowledge is the source of new ideas, which in turn generate further knowledge and new combinations. Collaboration with people with different backgrounds and knowledge has the potential to bring about new perspectives and discoveries.

The process of facing and overcoming one's own weaknesses is the key to high motivation and successful intelligence. Intellectual productivity is heavily influenced by problem awareness and process improvement. And this value is maximized by continuously creating &quot;good conditions.

Knowledge accumulated through one's own efforts is most valuable. The emergence of new information and knowledge requires the ability to solve problems in the absence of textbooks and information sources that are yet to become authorities.

Nishio's &quot;Collaboration with AI&quot; presents the idea that diverse perspectives are offered to improve knowledge productivity. In &quot;Knowledge, Capitalism, and the Technologist Condition,&quot; it is stated that discovering and communicating new knowledge is a means of value creation, and that knowledge can be transformed and communicated to others, creating customer value.

### nishio/🤖🔁 successful intelligence
🤖🔁 Successful intelligence
Successful intelligence is about making the most of one's abilities, discovering new information and knowledge, and building relationships in the pursuit of happiness and enjoyment. In this process, the concepts of &quot;play&quot; and &quot;enjoyment&quot; and the balance between &quot;spontaneity&quot; and &quot;initiative&quot; are essential.

Nishio's research notes suggest that the combination of knowledge is a source of new ideas, and that these ideas can lead to further knowledge and new combinations. At the same time, collaboration with people with different backgrounds and knowledge can lead to new perspectives and discoveries.

However, they are not always intelligent and sometimes act foolishly. This demonstrates that intelligence alone is not enough; self-understanding, self-improvement, and character are also important. The process of facing and overcoming one's weaknesses is the key to high motivation and successful intelligence.

From a systems perspective, there are two types of systems: those that augment human intelligence and those that have the ability to augment intelligence themselves. The former provides the means to augment human knowledge and abilities, while the latter can independently improve its own intelligence and abilities.

Intellectual productivity is greatly influenced by problem awareness and process improvement. Ideas that are nurtured with a great deal of effort and one's own enthusiasm are the most valuable. And this value is maximized by continuously creating &quot;good conditions.


### nishio/🌀Discomfort-driven intellectual production
Elements of successful intelligence include maintaining enjoyment and remaining intellectually productive. It is also believed that the nature of intellectual production depends on the presence or absence of problem awareness.

Knowledge productivity is not only human; new approaches exist that take advantage of uncertainty. Knowledge productivity can be improved by improving the way information is organized and analyzed.

A company is a collection of people, and an increase in the value of those people is an increase in the value of the company. Therefore, learning is encouraged.

Nishio's research note &quot;Discomfort-Driven Intellectual Production&quot; is relevant to the process of increasing the value of ideas. Granularity of Information&quot; is helpful as a method for improving the way information is organized and analyzed.

🤖🔁Difference-driven intellectual production
Problem awareness and process improvement
Turning work into a personal investment
Ideas without enthusiasm are of little value.
Putting in the effort when you feel uncomfortable is important to improve the value of your ideas.


### nishio/🤖2023-08-24 12:36
Intellectual production is a creative process that combines information and ideas to produce new knowledge and output, the quality of which is largely determined by individual experience and expertise. Depending on whether one is aware of the problem and tries to improve the process, or whether one tries to do as one is told, what appears to be the same job may or may not be intellectual production.

Nishio's research notes reaffirmed that the most important objective is to &quot;create a state of high intellectual productivity,&quot; that ideas are a resource that can be replicated, that creating something identical to an already existing idea is of little value, and that ideas can only be valuable after they are created and then nurtured and refined with a lot of effort. The workshop reaffirmed that ideas are only valuable when they are nurtured and refined with a lot of effort after they are born.

The perfect combination of these elements for knowledge productivity will be a force for creating new value. Combined, these perspectives will develop a new paradigm for the next generation of knowledge production.

Thinking about parsimony, we may need to take a broader view that includes not only humans, but also other life forms and AI to improve the productivity of knowledge. Person theory offers a new perspective for improving knowledge productivity.


### nishio/🌀AI and co.

Nishio's &quot;creating a state of high intellectual productivity,&quot; &quot;that ideas are a resource that can be replicated, and that producing the same idea as one that already exists is of little value,&quot; and &quot;that ideas only become valuable after they are created and after a lot of effort is put into nurturing and refining them. perspective is important for increasing the productivity of knowledge.

In addition, having a &quot;skillful and slow is better than poor&quot; perspective requires a certain level of anxiety tolerance. This indicates that a certain level of anxiety tolerance is necessary to improve knowledge productivity.

The notion that collaboration with AI provides a variety of perspectives to improve knowledge productivity requires a detailed explanation of how AI and humans collaborate and how this improves knowledge productivity.

Discovering and communicating new knowledge is a means of value creation, and knowledge is transformed and communicated to others, creating customer value. The value of knowledge is also measured by the actual benefits of its use.

Updating knowledge is more burdensome than learning new knowledge. This is because it requires negating existing knowledge. Investing in knowledge-producing technologies expands and reproduces knowledge capital.
