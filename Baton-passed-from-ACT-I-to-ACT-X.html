This is based on my experience as a research director of JST <a href="./ACT-I" class="internal" data-slug="ACT-I">ACT-I</a> “Information and the Future” until last year and as a current advisor for <a href="./ACT-X" class="internal" data-slug="ACT-X">ACT-X</a> “Frontiers of Mathematics and Information”.

<p>Dr. Yuichiro Anzai, “<a href="./Let's" class="internal alias" data-slug="Let's">Let’s</a> establish the individual.”</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Advice: “Be free to think independently, promote your own research, and become a leading expert in your field.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ACT-I was designed with the aim of supporting young researchers with “passion,” with an emphasis on helping them to “establish themselves.</p>
<ul>
<li>Following the success of ACT-I, its successor program, JST ACT-X, continues to develop as “a program that hopes to establish individual young researchers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>1 ) Supporting young researchers to “establish themselves</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(2) Support young researchers to promote challenging research and development while taking the initiative with free ideas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3 ) Provide <a href="./opportunities-for-human-exchange" class="internal alias" data-slug="opportunities-for-human-exchange">opportunities for human exchange</a> that will serve as <a href="./a-foundation-for-future-collaboration" class="internal alias" data-slug="a-foundation-for-future-collaboration">a foundation for future collaboration</a> by young researchers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Introduced “an immediate and confidential communication environment through text chat tools” to the interview screening process.</p>
<ul>
<li>Text communication in Slack</li>
<li>Communication between the research director, area advisors, and JST staff on their own computers</li>
<li>Not visible to applicants.
<ul>
<li>Exchange opinions during presentations and during questioning.</li>
<li>Share what opinions and questions you had while listening to the interview presentation.</li>
<li>Able to traffic what the research director wants the area advisor to hear in the Q&amp;A session.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Slack implementation has been dramatically superior
<ul>
<li>Screening of a large number of applicants and diverse disciplines made possible based on in-depth discussions</li>
<li>Impossible to just use the usual method of filling out the evaluation sheet after the presentation and sharing that file.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In ACT-I, the standard period of support was set at 1.5 years, and an additional accelerated phase period of 2 years was set for about one-third of the standard period by JST.</p>
<ul>
<li>We thought it was important to avoid the <a href="./stage-gate" class="internal" data-slug="stage-gate">stage-gate</a>-like misconception that “only the successful ones will advance to the acceleration phase.”</li>
<li>Explicit notice that the standard period is the heart of ACT-I’s support</li>
<li>All young researchers who took on the challenge of a year and a half of research can be proud to be “<a href="./graduates" class="internal" data-slug="graduates">graduates</a>” of this research area and be able to play an active role thereafter.
<ul>
<li>An important concept for unexplored juniors and unexplored IT<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>
<ul>
<li>We need to make sure that those who were not selected as Super Creators can be proud to be “graduates”.</li>
<li>We must ensure that those who did not advance to the Unexplored Advanced are not regarded as “those who could not lead to commercialization”.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Additional support was made available on request.
<ul>
<li>In fact, many do not wish to.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Foundation for future collaboration</li>
<li>be memorable</li>
<li>It is important to provide opportunities for human interaction</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is difficult for about 70 people to interact with each other in a friendly and memorable way by simply repeating 70 short presentations and Q&amp;A sessions, as is typical at academic conferences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(i) Creating an active voice environment through text chat</p>
<ul>
<li>Related:.<a href="./Announcement-Parallel-Chat" class="internal alias" data-slug="Announcement-Parallel-Chat">Announcement Parallel Chat</a> <img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/></li>
<li>When you have a simple question about the content of a presentation that is far away from your area of expertise, it is less psychologically challenging to post it in a chat room.
<ul>
<li>Other audience members with close expertise provided supplementary explanations, which deepened the understanding of the audience as a whole.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Gives more feedback than the usual questioning
<ul>
<li>Visualize what a large audience thought of your presentation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Slack content displayed on a small screen in front so that it could be read</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>(ii) Use of large, easy-to-read name tags</p>
<ul>
<li>Postcard-sized nameplate with last name in a large, prominent font</li>
<li>Print the same information on both sides of the nameplate so that the first and last name can be read even if the nameplate is turned over.</li>
<li>Related:.<a href="./RubyKaigi-nameplate" class="internal alias" data-slug="RubyKaigi-nameplate">RubyKaigi nameplate</a> <img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/></li>
<li>Also include the title of the research project</li>
<li>The color of the nameplate was changed for each fiscal year so that students could easily identify their peers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>(iii) Seat assignment</p>
<ul>
<li>To make it easier to talk to people you have never talked to before and to promote interdisciplinary exchange</li>
<li>All seating in the presentation rooms and at lunch and dinner were reserved.</li>
<li>Once you talk next to each other, it will be easier to talk during breaks, etc.</li>
<li>Convincing,<a href="./指定席メソッド" class="internal alias" data-slug="指定席メソッド">指定席メソッド</a>と呼ぼう<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/></li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Reflection with KPT</p>
<ul>
<li>All participants reflect on the domain meeting and write a 5-minute summary in Slack at the end of each meeting.</li>
<li>An average of about 149 entries are written.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Area Advisor Talks and Research Summary Talks: 5-minute talks per person when time permits on the program.</p>
<ul>
<li>Content is left up to the speaker</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alumni Session</p>
<ul>
<li>Researchers (graduates) who have completed their research term may voluntarily participate in area meetings upon agreeing to a confidentiality agreement.</li>
<li>After 2020, when the number of presenters will be reduced, we will have time for alumni to report on their recent activities.
<ul>
<li>The Unexplored IT<a href="./Boost-Conference" class="internal alias" data-slug="Boost-Conference">Boost Conference</a> に近い<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>
<ul>
<li>is “voluntary” meaning “available to those who wish to participate”?</li>
<li>If that’s the case, then the route is a little different from the unexplored IT that “participates at the request of the PM”</li>
<li>In the fifth year (2006) after this trial began, Unexplored said, “By all means, come on over in droves!”</li>
<li>Since 2008, there have been so many people who wanted to participate that the time for alumni to report on their recent activities has been overflowing.</li>
<li>After that, they stopped taking requests to participate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The four regional meetings after FY2020 will be held using Zoom.</p>
<ul>
<li>The audience always showed up, too, and we made an effort to clearly state the family name and the year of adoption.</li>
<li>The ability to see each other’s faces during breaks and other times of the day made it possible to interact in a chat-like manner.</li>
<li>get-together
<ul>
<li>Zoom’s Breakout Room</li>
<li>Random forced shuffling every 15 minutes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Advantages for alumni to participate remotely</li>
<li>There are many difficulties regarding which is better compared to the physical holding.<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>
<ul>
<li>Definitely useful as a work-around for a time when it was not possible to hold a physical at COVID19</li>
<li>Ditto the benefit of facilitating alumni participation.</li>
<li>There is fatigue due to prolonged periods of constant frontal viewing.</li>
<li>There is a psychological hurdle to starting a conversation in a general shared setting during breaks.
<ul>
<li>When you go to the person you want to talk to in a physical holding and start talking, you start with a conversation between two people, and that conversation is visible to those around you, so people can gradually join in.</li>
<li>Zoom starts with a whole broadcast.</li>
<li>On the other hand, if you create a <a href="./breakout-room" class="internal alias" data-slug="breakout-room">breakout room</a> that can be freely entered and exited for individual conversation, the conversation in the room cannot be seen from the outside.</li>
<li>I think this is the degree to which Zoom’s UI could be improved in this area.</li>
<li>Another solution was the use of <a href="./Spatial-Chat" class="internal alias" data-slug="Spatial-Chat">Spatial Chat</a> in 2020 at Unexplored Junior (<a href="./2020-Unexplored-Junior-SpatialChat" class="internal alias" data-slug="2020-Unexplored-Junior-SpatialChat">2020 Unexplored Junior SpatialChat</a>).
<ul>
<li>is not very good, and in 2021, the management allocated (rather than randomizing the system) to Zoom’s breakout room</li>
<li>Close to [Reserved seat method</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The 2022 Unexplored Conference Night was a get-together at <a href="./oVice" class="internal" data-slug="oVice">oVice</a>.</li>
<li>I also have the impression that <a href="./Remo" class="internal" data-slug="Remo">Remo</a> and <a href="./Gather.town" class="internal" data-slug="Gather.town">Gather.town</a> are being tried here and there.</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ul>
<p>4 ．Act-I “Information and the future” ingenuity in the debriefing session of the results of the</p>
<ul>
<li>ACT-I Advanced Research Forum, a public forum for the presentation of results</li>
<li>A place that attracts attention in an atmosphere different from that of a regular conference presentation</li>
<li>It is important to provide “a place where people feel it is worth presenting.
<ul>
<li>Professionally staged and hosted stage</li>
<li>High-impact visual and musical effects when researchers take the stage</li>
<li>Opening and closing videos are shown at the beginning and at the end of the entire event.</li>
<li>Attractively designed pamphlets distributed at the event</li>
<li>The Unexplored Conference alumni LT may be pretty close in composition, although the number of slots is small.<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>
<ul>
<li>I wish I could afford more, but it looks like I can’t.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Archives are also important
<ul>
<li>Video recordings of the presentations and posters were made continuously available on the Internet for anyone to view.</li>
<li>I completely agree with “archiving is important too.”<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>
<ul>
<li>In addition, the videos of boost meetings and interim presentations are stored in the private Scrapbox, in addition to the publicly available “results reports.</li>
<li>Participants from the next and subsequent years can see “what last year’s participants presented” and have the opportunity to learn about the project development process</li>
</ul>
