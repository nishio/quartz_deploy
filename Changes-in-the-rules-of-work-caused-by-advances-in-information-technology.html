The way of working‚Äù (Konosuke Matsushita)
Working by the sweat of one‚Äôs brow is
Precious, but without wisdom.
I sweat less.
It‚Äôs the progress of human life.
. Working an hour less and achieving more than ever before.
It‚Äôs a progressive way of working.
It requires ingenuity.
Required.
Work effortlessly and achieve results,
This is where social prosperity comes from.
Nishio summarized.

WEDGE REPORT
The amazing evolution that took place at the Miura City Agricultural Cooperative, which ‚Äúreduced eight hours of shipping work to one second.
Ryoko Yamaguchi (Journalist)
With the increasing use of IT in agriculture, the time required to schedule shipments, one of the most troublesome tasks for agricultural cooperatives, has increased significantly.
A new system has been developed to dramatically shorten the time it takes to complete a task that used to take eight hours a day to complete in just one second.
The company will introduce the system. The company that will introduce the system is Miura City Agricultural Cooperative in Kanagawa Prefecture (hereinafter referred to as ‚ÄúMiura City Agricultural Cooperative‚Äù) and Cybozu. Cybozu, Inc.
Using our own algorithms, we are able to schedule vehicles faster and more efficiently than human calculations.
This makes it possible to
