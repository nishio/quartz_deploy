<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>A good question leads the user to a flow state by providing a series of moderately sized tasks. Asking bad questions confuses the user and interrupts the flow.

<p>If the judgment is well done, the quality of questions will improve. If it’s not done well, it will get worse.</p>

<li>What happens to the question when this judgment is made?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>If the baseline for judging is off, you’re going to lose the diversity of questions by selecting only those questions that tend to be natural as a base.

<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>🙁

<li>What is the relationship between this decision and the user?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>(At any rate, I was concerned that it would slow down the response time, but that’s not really harmful. The issue of the baseline being off depending on the question needs to be resolved, imho) 🙁.</li>
