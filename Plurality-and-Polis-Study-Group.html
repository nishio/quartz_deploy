<li>Talking about Plurality is too abstract, so I‚Äôll start with a more familiar theme.</li>
<li>We will delve into the specific technical component of Plurality, Polis, at the end (because we may run out of time if we start here).</li>
</ul>
<p>Occurrence of hierarchical organization and changes due to technology</p>
<ul>
<li>I‚Äôll summarize again what I‚Äôve written several times.

<li><img src="https://gyazo.com/8ee1bf4b0b2ea910dfee7e89aa333290/thumb/1000" alt="image"/>
<ul>
<li>There is a limit to the number of people one can communicate with.
- <a href="./Number-of-Dunbars" class="internal alias" data-slug="Number-of-Dunbars">Number of Dunbars</a></li>
<li>If you try to communicate in a group of 100 people, if you speak one, you have to listen to 99 others.</li>
<li>As the size of the organization grows, it becomes harder and harder to communicate like a simple one-on-one conversation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://gyazo.com/c809ecc731b9a7b5441b363bbdd4e755/thumb/1000" alt="image"/>
<ul>
<li>That‚Äôs where the organizational hierarchy came in.
<ul>
<li>Create a group responsible for an area.</li>
<li>One person in the group shall be the representative of that group</li>
<li>Communicate only with that person.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This solved the ‚Äúit‚Äôs hard to communicate with everyone in the organization‚Äù problem.</li>
<li>But another problem arose.</li>
<li>By lengthening the chain of message games:.
<ul>
<li>Increased frequency of information being hidden or distorted during transmission</li>
<li>Increases the time it takes to gather the necessary information.</li>
<li>These are now recognized as major organizational problems</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://gyazo.com/9cfcddde776b9bf6a6b7e4798eaff276/thumb/1000" alt="image"/>
<ul>
<li>The development of technology for reproduction and transmission of information has solved the problem first in one direction only.
<ul>
<li>Direction for communicating the president‚Äôs thoughts to employees
<ul>
<li>Video lectures by <a href="./national-radio-(esp.-an-NHK-radio-station)" class="internal alias" data-slug="national-radio-(esp.-an-NHK-radio-station)">national radio (esp. an NHK radio station)</a> and [Konosuke Matsushita</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>President writes thoughts on groupware</li>
<li>As of 2023, this is often done in the form of Zoom + recording</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>But since this is a replication and transmission technique, it does not solve the problem of information transmission in the reverse direction
<ul>
<li>If 1,000 employees send a video message to the president for 10 minutes each, it would take the president 7 days x 24 hours to watch it.</li>
<li>Totally unrealistic.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This issue also arises with respect to a single employee.
<ul>
<li><img src="https://gyazo.com/bce5b25b3d888673b421ade41f9c5716/thumb/1000" alt="image"/></li>
<li>A hierarchical organization would have been able to limit the amount of information to be processed by focusing only on the smaller organizations to which they belonged.</li>
<li>With a company-wide information sharing system, the total amount of information shared from all departments would be so large that it would be impossible to see it all</li>
<li>Individuals filter appropriately.
<ul>
<li>I guess I‚Äôll have to see if I get a menschon.</li>
<li>I guess I‚Äôll have to see what‚Äôs within the same location.</li>
<li>I guess I don‚Äôt need to look at the faraway places.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>That makes it difficult to understand the company-wide situation.
<ul>
<li>Because most people try to look only at ‚Äúinformation in departments close to their own‚Äù.</li>
<li><a href="./Siloed" class="internal" data-slug="Siloed">Siloed</a></li>
<li>Once information is gathered around the president, it is digested at a reasonable cost and then disseminated to all employees.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://gyazo.com/01f286ba41e02b8bda44af91ea938882/thumb/1000" alt="image"/>
<ul>
<li>The problem so far has arisen because the transmission and reproduction of information has ‚Äúincreased the amount of information</li>
<li>The solution will come when technologies to ‚Äúreduce the amount of information‚Äù are created.
<ul>
<li>I wrote <a href="./Changes-in-organizational-structure-brought-about-by-LLM" class="internal alias" data-slug="Changes-in-organizational-structure-brought-about-by-LLM">Changes in organizational structure brought about by LLM</a> thinking as of March 2023 that ‚Äú<a href="./LLM" class="internal" data-slug="LLM">LLM</a> will lead to that technology.‚Äù</li>
<li>Then in April I learned about the concept of <a href="./Plurality" class="internal" data-slug="Plurality">Plurality</a>.
<ul>
<li>In reading the draft written by <a href="./Audrey-Tang" class="internal alias" data-slug="Audrey-Tang">Audrey Tang</a> about Plurality, I learned about the concept of [broad listening</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Broad Listening, where millions of people can hear the essence extracted from the distribution of opinions of their peers</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>The opinions of many people can be digested by a machine to obtain a reduced amount of
<ul>
<li>Conversely, for the same cognitive cost, you get to hear more people‚Äôs opinions</li>
<li>Digital technology is enhancing ‚Äúthe ability to understand what many other people are doing.</li>
<li>This is <a href="./Human-Augmentation" class="internal alias" data-slug="Human-Augmentation">Human Augmentation</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This technology not only ‚Äúallows the CEO to better understand the organization,‚Äù but also allows each and every employee ‚Äúto better understand the organization for everyone.
<ul>
<li><img src="https://gyazo.com/01f286ba41e02b8bda44af91ea938882/thumb/1000" alt="image"/> Reprinted in</li>
<li>The role of maintaining a hierarchical network to convey information out of the president‚Äôs business is no longer needed.
<ul>
<li>Role of the ‚Äúhub in the organization‚Äôs information network</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Differences in knowledge, experience, and other attributes of each individual, or ‚Äúdiversity,‚Äù rather than hierarchical roles, will become more important.
<ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Decentralized and autonomous decision making, except for decisions that really need to be made by the president, will allow him to act more quickly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This technology eliminates most of the reasons why hierarchical organization was needed
<ul>
<li>So the organizational structure changes.

<li>Of course there are organizations that don‚Äôt want to change.</li>
<li>It means fewer constraints for organizations that are trying to change.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>So far, I have explained the topic in the image of a private company as a familiar topic.</li>
<li>Audrey Tang believes this will bring similar changes to <a href="./the-governance-structure" class="internal alias" data-slug="the-governance-structure">the governance structure</a>.

<ul>
<li>Bandwidth too narrow</li>
<li>That‚Äôs due to historical circumstances that once there was no digest technology available to handle the collection.</li>
<li>Digital technology should allow us to gather people‚Äôs thoughts more efficiently.</li>

<li>In the years to come, they will merge and create something better.</li>

</li>
<li>Software assists in better understanding what members are thinking.‚Äù
<ul>
<li>It will be a very important technical element in realizing Cybozu‚Äôs vision ‚Äú<a href="./Creating-a-society-full-of-teamwork" class="internal alias" data-slug="Creating-a-society-full-of-teamwork">Creating a society full of teamwork</a>‚Äù.</li>
<li>I‚Äôm sure there are many organizations among Cybozu‚Äôs customers that would love to have this technology.</li>
<li>The needs are not verbalized now, and only when they are shown in a form will they say, ‚ÄúOh yes, this is what I wanted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>vTaiwan is used for decision-making by the Taiwanese government because of Audrey Tang‚Äôs strong top-down leadership.
<ul>
<li>In Japan, I don‚Äôt see it being used for government decision making anytime soon.
<ul>
<li>Private companies with forward-thinking presidents and local governments with forward-thinking chief executives will move first.</li>
<li>I think a few pilot cases will be created and gradually spread out.</li>
<li>It is beneficial to expand the ‚Äúexperience of using this kind of thing‚Äù at the grassroots.</li>

<li>question
<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>There‚Äôs still a need to build a team, right?
<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>If there‚Äôs a task to be performed by multiple people working together, then a team is created in the broadest sense.
<ul>
<li>The need for that team to be static is reduced.</li>
<li>In particular, it reduces the need for a structure where ‚Äúthere is a fixed team of members, and one person on that team is the point of contact for communication with the rest of the team.‚Äù</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>Of the constraints that determine the structure of an organization, does this mean that communication constraints are reduced and thus the structure of the organization is more flexible?

<li>This is what happens when digital technology allows the government to know ‚Äúwho is where‚Äù.</li>

<li>The reason Japanese are not very familiar with the fear of losing democracy in Chinese-speaking countries is largely due to the language barrier.

<li>China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan can understand each other‚Äôs spoken language quite well.</li>
<li>Most Japanese do not understand Chinese.</li>

<li>Taiwan is geographically close to China and Hong Kong, so it is easy to feel close to them.

</li>
<li>A method to uniquely identify people is needed to achieve this

  - W3C Recommendation: [[Decentralized Identifiers]]
  - Talk about being able to detach the verifier at this stage.
  - I think &quot;I don't feel like I can&quot; is probably one verifier, an image that identifies &quot;humanness&quot; at 0% or 100%.
      - However, there are other approaches that can be considered to increase the reliability of personal identification by linking multiple verifiers together.
          - Related [[Gitcoin Passport]].
      - In this use case, we don't need a 100% human guarantee, just a vote count based on humaneness.
      - If the cost of a bot account acquiring human-like characteristics becomes high enough, there is no practical problem.
  - Other non-governmental organizations that provide human assurance, such as OpenAI's Sam Altman's [[Worldcoin]], are starting up, so that in the near future we will have enough human assurance to be practical without relying on the government.

</li>
<li>Polis is the name of the software</li>
<li>To use an analogy, ‚ÄúSource code should be version controlled, right?‚Äù is the vision, and Git is the name of the software.</li>
<li>The Polis story and the DID story connect in a way that ‚Äúboth are useful components to realize the vision.

<li>And I‚Äôm interested in the Polis side.</li>

<p>How Polis Works</p>
<ul>
<li>Open source, licensed under AGPL</li>
<li>There is a pre-deployed server pol.is, so anyone can quickly try it out for a bit.
<ul>
<li>I wrote an explanation: <a href="./how-to-start-a-topic-in-/japol/Polis" class="internal alias" data-slug="how-to-start-a-topic-in-/japol/Polis">Polis</a>.</li>
<li>I think it would be beneficial for Japan if more Japanese people use Polis after seeing this.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If a company is using it for internal use, they‚Äôll want to set up their own instance.
<ul>
<li>Docker service is up and running in about 2 lines of command after cloning from Github.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can turn on machine translation of posts, so you can use it with a community of people who speak different languages.</li>
<li>How hard is it to customize?
<ul>
<li>I could read the source code and rewrite the UI.</li>
<li>Client side is React
<ul>
<li>But there‚Äôs quite a bit of jQuery-based code.</li>
<li>Polls and such are hitting <code>api/v3/votes</code> with jQuery.</li>
<li>This comes to <code>handle_POST_votes</code> in <code>server/app.ts</code> or something like that.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It feels like it was made in a college lab.
<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>Do you mean simple construction?</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>It feels like it‚Äôs all pieced together, not by the CTO who selected the technologies, but by the individual ‚Äúdoers‚Äù who came to the lab and used what they wanted to use the most, without thinking about maintainability or anything like that.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The process of determining the next voting target to be displayed on the server was not random.
<ul>
<li>I previously answered ‚Äúrandomly selected,‚Äù but I was wrong.</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>I was talking about ‚Äúit‚Äôs random, you don‚Äôt have to answer all of them‚Äù in the context of there being so many questions that it‚Äôs hard to answer them all.</li>
<li>Yes, and the actual implementation was further ahead, designed to ask the questions in such a way that even if you stop in the middle of an answer, you can still get as much information as possible in the process.</li>
<li><code>getNextPrioritizedComment</code>
<ul>
<li>Roughly speaking, it looks like they multiply the PCA by the PCA, and then determine a probabilistic priority based on that.</li>
<li>
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/GPT-4/icon" alt="GPT-4.icon" height="19.5"/>
  - This getNextPrioritizedComment function is used to obtain the next comment with the highest priority.
      - Three functions, getComments, getPca, and getNumberOfCommentsRemaining, are called asynchronously. Each function retrieves the comments, the result of principal component analysis, and the number of comments remaining.
      - The selectProbabilistically function is used to select comments probabilistically. The function is passed the list of comments, the priority of the comments, the total number of comments, and the number of comments remaining as parameters.
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>question</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>What is the origin of Polis?
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Polis is a Greek term referring to a city, city-state, citizenship or government by citizens. When used in reference to ancient Greece, such as ancient Athens, it is usually translated as <a href="./city-state" class="internal" data-slug="city-state">city-state</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>It is also the origin of the words police, policy, politics, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%9D%E3%83%AA%E3%82%B9" class="external">Polis - Wikipedia<svg aria-hidden="true" class="external-icon" style="max-width:0.8em;max-height:0.8em;" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><path d="M320 0H288V64h32 82.7L201.4 265.4 178.7 288 224 333.3l22.6-22.6L448 109.3V192v32h64V192 32 0H480 320zM32 32H0V64 480v32H32 456h32V480 352 320H424v32 96H64V96h96 32V32H160 32z"></path></svg></a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/gpt-4/icon" alt="gpt-4.icon" height="19.5"/>Democracy was first implemented in an inclusive form in the polis of Athens around the 5th century BC.
<ul>
<li>Polis provided the context for democracy to develop, and the institution of polis facilitated the functioning of the democratic system.</li>
<li>For example, the agora, the central public space of the polis, was used as a place for citizens to gather and discuss public issues.</li>
<li>This was a practical expression of the democratic ideal of open debate and public decision-making.</li>
<li>In Athenian democracy, each citizen of the polis had the right to participate in the ekklesia (assembly), where he could speak and vote on public matters.</li>
<li>The Boulez, composed of 500 citizens elected by lot, was also an integral part of the polis, playing an important role in the democratic process by setting the agenda for the ekklesia.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>It was a direct democracy, and the political system differed from polis to polis.
<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Important Points
<ul>
<li>Modern Japanese democracy is an indirect democracy in which ‚Äúfirst we elect representatives, and then those representatives make decisions.</li>
<li>Audrey Tan pokes at it, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs too little bandwidth, isn‚Äôt it, just the way it was to achieve democracy in an era without digital technology, and digital natives are not happy with that slow upload speed.‚Äù
- <a href="./Elections-are-slow-communications,-sending-5-bits-every-four-years." class="internal alias" data-slug="Elections-are-slow-communications,-sending-5-bits-every-four-years.">Elections are slow communications, sending 5 bits every four years.</a>
- <a href="./Digital-natives-don't-think-that-once-every-four-years-upload-bandwidth-is-enough." class="internal alias" data-slug="Digital-natives-don't-think-that-once-every-four-years-upload-bandwidth-is-enough.">Digital natives don‚Äôt think that once-every-four-years upload bandwidth is enough.</a></li>
<li>People should be able to upload more information.
<ul>
<li>Answering 30 questions in Polis is 30 bits, more information than an election.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Directly express approval or disapproval of individual agenda items
- <a href="./Democracy-by-Paper-and-Box" class="internal alias" data-slug="Democracy-by-Paper-and-Box">Democracy by Paper and Box</a> was not done, because the cost was too high.
<ul>
<li>Digital technology has lowered costs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you say <a href="./digital-voting" class="internal alias" data-slug="digital-voting">digital voting</a>, there are a lot of problems to be pointed out, etc.
<ul>
<li>I don‚Äôt want to advocate ‚Äúreplacing‚Äù the current <a href="./Democracy-by-Paper-and-Box" class="internal alias" data-slug="Democracy-by-Paper-and-Box">Democracy by Paper and Box</a> of electing representatives with digital voting.</li>
<li>Useful as a tool to help elected representatives better gather and understand people‚Äôs views</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>You mean instead of a poll?</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Yes. But there‚Äôs more progress there, too.
<ul>
<li>Audrey Tan, ‚Äú<a href="./Open-up-agenda-setting-authority-to-people" class="internal alias" data-slug="Open-up-agenda-setting-authority-to-people">Open up agenda-setting authority to people</a>‚Äù
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Opening the agenda-setting authority to the people would return the people‚Äôs approval or disapproval of each agenda to the people. Public officials no longer have exclusive ownership of the agenda. --- Audrey Tang</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It is important to release the people to decide what questions should be asked</li>
<li>Instead of bureaucrats and the media deciding what questions to ask and then asking them, people post what they think should be discussed on this point, others agree or disagree with them, it is visualized, and then it is repeated</li>
<li>That‚Äôs the difference between this and today‚Äôs so-called ‚Äúpolls‚Äù.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>Polls, different newspapers may ask different questions in different ways and get different results, and there may be a discussion about which way to ask the questions.</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>For that matter, even if you did it with Polis, if the question or population is biased, you‚Äôll get biased results.
<ul>
<li>There‚Äôs an argument that if a newspaper or some other company calls you and polls you, claiming that they‚Äôre doing random sampling to avoid bias, you‚Äôre already biased at the time whether or not you get such a call.</li>
<li>I think it would be better to allow anyone to participate on the Internet.</li>
<li>Of course, even if we did it in that form, there would be another bias, specifically the suppression of the opinions of the elderly who don‚Äôt do the internet, which I would prefer.</li>
<li>Because of the <a href="./silver-democracy" class="internal alias" data-slug="silver-democracy">silver democracy</a> issue, the power of voice is biased toward the elderly, and society as a whole would be better if we had a structure that allows younger people to express their opinions more easily, in my personal opinion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>It‚Äôs hard to answer questions correctly because it requires studying the context.
<ul>
<li>Even if you write an agenda, you will not get good answers if the intent is not understood. The good thing about indirect democracy is that it allows legislators to spend time studying. With direct democracy, people have to study.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>There is no requirement to do so, just delegate those who don‚Äôt want to do so.
<ul>
<li>In today‚Äôs indirect democracy, we give our legislators 100% delegation on every agenda item with a ‚Äúyou study it for me.‚Äù</li>
<li>You can express your opinion on the issues on which you want to express your opinion, and deligitimize those that do not, as in the past.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>I don‚Äôt know if we should have a system where you can state who you trust.</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Some people are thinking of doing something like that, and although it has not been implemented in Polis so far, I think it could be implemented.
<ul>
<li>In the current indirect democracy, everything is delegated to a single person regardless of the theme, but I would like to decide who to delegate each theme. For example, in my case, I would like to be involved in policies involving digital technology, but I am not a party to the issue of married couples‚Äô surnames, so I would like to delegate to someone who is actually disadvantaged by the issue. It would be good if we could decide who to entrust with each agenda item. Well, if people can‚Äôt be bothered to choose, they throw the whole thing to one person, but that‚Äôs the baseline of indirect democracy we have now, so it would be better than that.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>Image of people with interest and knowledge to participate</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Correct. Not everyone is equally interested in every agenda item, nor are they all willing to devote the same amount of time to it.
<ul>
<li>So it is preferable that people with a lot of enthusiasm and interest can disseminate more information. What I am comparing this to is a paper-and-box voting system <a href="./one-vote-per-person" class="internal alias" data-slug="one-vote-per-person">one vote per person</a>. Whether a person is uninterested and votes randomly, or whether a person is very enthusiastic, only the same amount of information can be sent out to all of them. But wouldn‚Äôt it be a more accurate statistic if the weight of the votes were increased depending on the enthusiasm of the voter?
<ul>
<li>Related: <a href="./Quadratic-Voting" class="internal alias" data-slug="Quadratic-Voting">Quadratic Voting</a> is the mechanism that makes it happen</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>Polis can only ‚Äúinterpret‚Äù what emerges from the vote?
<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>We do not believe that decision making is done by Polis alone. The perception is that it is a tool to efficiently collect ‚Äúhow other people feel‚Äù after there is a separate person making the decision.</li>
<li>Taiwan‚Äôs case is also in the form of ‚Äúthe Taiwanese government gathers everyone‚Äôs opinions and decides what kind of law to make.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>If a lot of people do Polis to get a comprehensive view of the issues, it would be helpful to organize them by saying, ‚ÄúOh, there is this point of view?
<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Yes, I guess you could call it ‚Äú<a href="./brainstorming-the-issues" class="internal alias" data-slug="brainstorming-the-issues">brainstorming the issues</a>‚Äù? If the government decides ‚Äúthis is the issue‚Äù and then puts it to a vote, then the ‚Äúnot on that axis‚Äù opinion loses a way to come up with an opinion. Instead, the issues themselves should be made available for people to submit, and through mutual voting on each issue, it would be possible to visualize which ones everyone agrees on, and which ones there is a difference of opinion on. And, based on that, it will be easier for decision makers to make better decisions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>Maybe it would be nice to be able to go back and forth between visualization and discussion of Polis.
<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>I believe the Uber case study in <a href="./vTaiwan" class="internal" data-slug="vTaiwan">vTaiwan</a> had four rounds of visualization and discussion.
<ul>
<li>So, in other words, Polis is not a decision-making tool by itself, but a tool to gather opinions from a large number of people to guide better decisions.</li>
<li>It could be a tool for safe brainstorming on controversial topics.</li>
<li>A mechanism that prevents ‚Äúdisputes between A and B who have different opinions‚Äù from occurring.</li>
<li>It is difficult to become a person-to-person confrontation because it is abstracted and seen as an ‚Äúopinion group‚Äù made up of many people.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
