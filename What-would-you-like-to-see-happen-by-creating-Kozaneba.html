<li>Is there anything else about this “Regroup”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>It was difficult to add functions when it reached a certain scale because there was no test code, it was not designed to be easy to test, and it was quite difficult to test it after it reached a certain state. It was difficult to do so, so we reworked the code while conducting thorough testing.

<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>That’s the point, isn’t it? I initially developed Regroup with the idea of “making a tool that is easy for me to use,” and when I tried to tell people how to use it, I thought, “No, it’s too hard to tell people how to use it with the current system,” so I redeveloped it. Obviously, what people find valuable has changed since the beginning. I haven’t been able to dig deeper into that, but if I put it into words for now, it seems that they feel value in “being used by many people.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>What kind of “tool” is this “tool”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Oh, well, I’ve gone from doing it on paper myself to doing it on Regroup, and I think it’s a useful tool, but maybe I want to make sure it’s not a “self-serving assumption” that it’s being used by a lot of people.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/>Is there anything else you can tell us about that “tool”?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>When people other than myself start using it, they use it in ways I did not expect, and my thinking can develop from that stimulus. For example, running Keicho on Scrapbox. I see, the buds that are born can grow by the hands of others, and you want to create opportunities for growth for Kozaneba.
