Local government and municipalities think that it is difficult to catch up such high-tech innovation. Japan has 1,741 municipalities, so many local governments are very small and difficult to catch up to new technologies. How do you think?

Well, I mean, maybe it‚Äôs not about catching up to new technologies. We always take the stance of helping the helpers. So, the idea is that the people who help their local citizens, we need to empower them, not to force them to use the national system. This is why the $6,000 NTD hand-out system deliberately chose these three different ways. People who are okay with post office, like my grandma, they still go to the post office. People who like convenience stores, everybody likes convenience stores, go to the convenience store and use the ATM machine embedded in the convenience store. People who use their phones just type their account and receive cash from their phones.

People who like convenience stores, and everyone likes convenience stores, go to convenience stores and use the ATMs embedded in them. Those who use cell phones, simply enter their account and receive cash from their cell phone.
And so, if we had only used one or two of these three main ways of dispensing cash, there are some people who will be forced to retrain in the municipalities. But because these three already encompass all of the local governments, they are not going to be able to use the national system. So, because these three already encompass all of the options, really, for what people usually interact with the financial system. So, nobody needs to relearn anything. They just reuse whatever they have.

This is just like when we do mask pre-ordering or our vaccine registration. People who trust the local pharmacies, they go to the local pharmacies. People who trust the, again, convenience stores, go to the convenience stores. People who use the Universal Healthcare Express app will use the app.
This is the same as placing an appointment order for masks or registering for vaccines. People who trust their local pharmacy go to their local pharmacy. Those who trust the convenience store will still go to the convenience store. People who use the Universal Health Care Express app will use this app.
And we sometimes, like for vulnerable population, of course, we will soon have a plan to give them like free 4G connectivity and so on. But even before that, we also make sure that they can just use a printed form and they can fill their envelope of their bank accounts or just write in their contact for receiving a check. And they can just fill it and put it into a nearby post place. And then, the AI recognition or OCR or whatever, have it on the backend.

So, for them, again, there is no difference of how they normally exchange things. But streamlining happens on the back end to help the helpers for them, right? So, this is the same principle we adopt this year for the age tech for people to empower the elderly people by helping their helpers instead of just treating them as people to be, you know, care-taking relationship. We want to make sure that they can shine on their own. Maybe they are comfortable only with live video. Then live video it is. Live video, if they only speak their local language, local language it is. If they only do sign language, sign language it is. So, by designing civic tech to fit the helpers, I think we can avoid a lot of the drawback on forcing the municipalities to retrain their staff.
