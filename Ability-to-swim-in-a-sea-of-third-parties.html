I said, “That’s crazy. I think parents can do at most 30 to 40% of the work in child-rearing,” he replied. He seemed surprised at the smallness of my estimate.</p>

Children have individuality to begin with. Also, once they enter school life, they interact with a variety of people, and from there, the child still has a lot to learn. Parents can only do at most 30-40% of what they can do for their children. However, it is very important because it is the foundation of the pyramid.</p>

I don’t use the word “talent” very often, but I think that “taste” is something you are born with. My son has had a strong interest in the structure of things, and in things graphic, since he was a baby. My daughter, on the other hand, seemed to have a better intuition for figures than my son, but she was less interested in them.</p>

He spent about half an hour repeatedly observing why the protruding part of the doorknob would move in and out when the doorknob was turned. He was also very interested in studying the mechanism that prevents the door from opening when it is closed. I had to hold him the whole time.</p>

However, since the son’s interest is not so strong, in the end, the son is superior in terms of “taste” in terms of graphic sense.</p>

However, it is just a “use” for mommy’s game. She is not interested in the mechanism.</p>

This has led to a retreat from the “parents are 90%” viewpoint. Changing public opinion inevitably takes time, and the understanding of many people is essential.</p>
