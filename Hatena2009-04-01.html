*1238562617*I made a switch statement in Python 3.0
Since it's April Fool's Day, I tried to do something false.

>|python|
for x in range(5):
    print(x)
    MESSAGE = &quot;The value is&quot;

    class _(switch(x)):
        @case(0)
        def _():
            print(MESSAGE, &quot;zero!&quot;)

        @case(1)
        def _():
            print(MESSAGE, &quot;one!&quot;)

        @case(2)
        def _():
            print(MESSAGE, &quot;twei!&quot;)

        @case_else
        def _():
            print(MESSAGE, &quot;something else!!&quot;)
||&lt;

I put the MESSAGE outside of the class to show that it can see the scope outside of the class. It is natural for nested_scopes or later to work.

This is what happens when it is executed.
>||
0
The value is zero!
1
The value is one!
2
The value is twei!
3
The value is something else!!
4
The value is something else!!
||&lt;

Click here for implementation:
>|python|
def switch(val):
    case.cases = []
    case_else.func = lambda :None

    class SwitchMetaclass(type):
        def __init__(cls, name, bases, dct):
            if not case.cases: return
            for (v, func) in case.cases:
                if v == val:
                    func()
                    break
            else:
                case_else.func()
                

    class Switch(metaclass=SwitchMetaclass): pass
    return Switch

def case(x):
    def foo(f):
        case.cases.append((x, f))
    return foo

def case_else(f):
    case_else.func = f
||&lt;

The metaclass constructor __init__ is called at the timing when the metaclass instance (i.e., class) is instantiated, so it is just a matter of creating a function/value mapping with a decorator and executing it at that timing, looking for matches in order from the mapping.

I was trying to do something practical with class Foo(lambda: ...) as suggested by id:moriyoshi. I was trying to do something practical with class Foo(lambda: ...), which id:moriyoshi told me recently, but I ended up with something other than lambda.

PS: If you feel frustrated after reading this entry, here's another recommendation: &lt;a href='http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nishiohirokazu/20120902/1346576549'>Practice not thinking&lt;/a>.

*1238589956*April Fool's Day
I picked up a thunderbolt in front of Kitasenri station on my way home from university, should I report this to the police?

*1238595595* My head is not in good shape.
Hmmm.
I think my diaper is not in good shape.


I have a very short concentration span, so work that requires long periods of concentration doesn't go well at all. This morning's code to tinker with metaclasses and do weird things lasted about 15 minutes. Well, when I stepped on the gas pedal, the engine would just say &quot;psshhhh&quot; and not turn over at all, but now it turns over at least. It's like after about 15 minutes of driving, the radiator starts making a warning sound due to overheating.


So I should have had a paper spread out at hand to think about drawing graphs, but for some reason I'm writing on Twitter &quot;What should I learn to be able to write SF?&quot; and translating English videos. Mwah.


Should I just go back to the task list and start picking them off in order? I'm drawing a graph on a piece of paper that says, &quot;The current task itself is not on the task list! That's a derailment!


Oh, yes. I was going to do something about the papers that were strewn all over the place.

- ‚ñ° Create a temporary place to store documents.
-- A container of documents taken from the mail that must be processed.
-- A place to keep important documents that you will need later.
--- Tickets, etc. (need to remember to bring them on the day)
--- Medical expenses, receipts, etc. (may be needed for next year's tax return)
-- Documents to be processed with due dates
-- Money vouchers with an expiration date (such as discount coupons for meals)
-- A container for documents that need to be engraved (with addresses, etc.)
-- Unwanted documents (to the trash)

For now, let's make a place for outstanding documents and a place for &quot;documents that will be needed later&quot;. I made it. For now, I put everything that was scattered all over my desk and stuff in there. Whew.

Stored documents do not speak of due dates. So if you store them, you may inadvertently forget to process them.
The way to prevent this would be to &quot;write it in the schedule&quot; since the processing deadline is still a deadline.

- Temporary document container (not yet processed, new mail: Inbox)
- Place to store until needed later.
-- Tickets, etc. (up to a specific date)
-- Medical expenses and receipts (until tax return)
-- Warranty card/receipt for the machine (until the warranty expires)
-- Machine operating instructions (until machine is disposed of)
- Items to be processed by the deadline (write them in the schedule!)
-- Documents to be processed by the deadline
-- Money orders and meal discount coupons with expiration dates
- Items to be disposed of
-- Items that need to be engraved (e.g., items with addresses on them)
-- those that don't (go right to the trash!)

It's easy to advise people who are screaming, &quot;I can't find my papers! It's easy to advise people who are fretting about missing documents to keep them in a safe place, but in reality, a large percentage of people who say, &quot;I can't find my documents! But in reality, I think a large percentage of people who say, &quot;I can't find my documents! I have three plastic containers full of papers, but I don't need receipts from five years ago, and I have a lot of A4 kraft envelopes, so let's do an inventory. I'll take out the papers and put the ones that need to be kept in the envelopes and the ones that don't go in the bin to be thrown away.

*1238605664*Re: I'm not even going to sigh.
&lt;a href='http://d.hatena.ne.jp/finalvent/20090323/1237767824'>What's the point of sighing - finalvent's diary&lt;/a>

I agree 100% with the assertion that &quot;It is known that poor nutrition can cause mental disorders such as anger&quot; is an exaggeration, or &quot;If you say 'it is known,' show us the source. I wonder what the benefit is in denying a mentally ill person a source of comfort. It doesn't seem like a very rational course of action.

To use an analogy, you might go to Kitano Tenmangu Shrine at the beginning of the year and say, &quot;There is no way that visiting Tenmangu Shrine will change my chances of passing the exam. Do you really believe that? Are you stupid?&quot; It's like shouting, &quot;You really believe that? In theory, it is correct. But who would benefit from such a cry?

&lt;body> Interesting. There are two translations that caught my attention. &lt;BR>1. &quot;about a job that doesn't exist yet&quot; is PREPARING, so it's a nuance like &lt;BR>&quot;in preparation for a job that doesn't exist yet&quot;. &lt;br>I'm not talking about being able to teach specifically (&quot;about&quot;), but &lt;br>assuming that you should be able to adapt to it (the unknown job). &lt;br>I think the nuance of &quot;even though there is no way I could teach about a job that doesn't exist yet&quot;&lt;br>(not knowing about the future, but relying on the past to do so)&lt;br>is behind this. &lt;br>2. &quot;Using technology that has not yet been invented&quot; has't been&lt;br>so I think phrases like &quot;did not exist until yesterday&quot; would be appropriate. &lt;br>Because you can't use technology that doesn't exist at the moment. &lt;/body>
&lt;timestamp>1238672301&lt;/timestamp>
&lt;/comment>
&lt;comment>
&lt;username>nishiohirokazu&lt;/username>
&lt;body>I see, the nuance of preparing can certainly be expressed by &quot;to prepare for&quot;. I'll correct that. &lt;br>As for the second point, I think it is reasonable to interpret it as referring to &quot;technology that does not exist at this time&quot; in context, since &quot;haven't been&quot; also means &quot;does not exist yet at this time&quot;. &lt;/body>
&lt;timestamp>1238688504&lt;/timestamp>

&lt;body>I'm sorry to be negative, but I didn't think it was particularly worth it. Well, to each his own. &lt;BR>The last What does it all mean ? My own answer to this question is, It doesn't mean anything ! . It's just like looking at the present part of a long history.„ÄÄFor example, if the same question was asked 100 years ago, I would think that 100 years from now, there is nothing.... It's not like there is something that will destroy the human race. &lt;/body>.

&lt;body>You are in the middle of an unprecedented paradigm shift. &lt;BR>When you think about it, the environment has changed dramatically between five years ago and now. &lt;br>This is such a big change that you can actually feel it in your daily life. &lt;BR>If I were to think back five years ago in the same way, I would not be as shocked as I am now. &lt;BR>&lt;BR>As a student looking for a job&lt;BR>>The US Department of Labor estimates that students today will be working 10 to 14 jobs&lt;BR>>by the age of 38. &lt;br>>>One in four workers has been in their current job less than a year&lt;br>>One in two has been in their current job less than five years&lt;br>&lt;br>These somethings got me wondering. &lt;/body>

&lt;body>You brought up the population issue at the beginning and end. Population growth in China and India means that the number of talented people is exploding as well&lt;br>. That means they have the potential to dominate the world as the overwhelming manpower of the future. &lt;br>What do you guys (US students) think about this? &lt;br>What do you (U.S. students) think about this? I think that is the question that you are asking. &lt;br>They are saving plant seeds, especially in the U.S., and I have no doubt that this is a major bargaining chip in the future. &lt;br>The monopoly of GMOs is another powerful card. &lt;br>There are also whispers of plans to reduce the population through the spread of viruses. &lt;br>This is a good sign that some of the students who are asked will actually go down this path of population reduction. &lt;br>OG!

&lt;body>&quot;It is estimated that a week's worth of information contained in the New York Times is more than an 18th century person would encounter in a lifetime. This has been said for about 30 years now. An older planner once told me. &lt;/body>
