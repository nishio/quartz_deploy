Empirically obvious” refers to self-evidentness based on experience. However, if the experience is not shared, it may not be obvious to others. In addition, those who seek explanations for “experientially self-evident” may not be paying the cost of the experience. This refers to the effort, time, etc., that the experiencer has put into verbalizing his or her experience.</p>

<p>Knowledge and understanding based on experiences and experiences differ depending on an individual’s perspective and background. To verbalize and share them is an important step to help others understand what a person has experienced. However, the process involves costs in terms of time and effort. In addition, in order for others to understand the experience, it is necessary for them to have a similar experience or to think deeply about the experience.</p>

### The Intellectual Production of Engineers What is intellectual production/advantages of reading this book.
I am excited by the stimulation this book has given me to notice [blind spots] and [verbalizing] my experiences, and I feel that I can improve further in the future.

On the other hand, there are opinions to the contrary.
 not keeping one's feet on the ground
 &quot;So, what do I do?&quot; I don't know what to do.

If the materials are not available, [coupling] will not occur. The &quot;ground&quot; is [experience]. If you didn't feel right after reading this book, unfortunately, you didn't have enough material this time. But that's okay. Experience will accumulate in you day by day, and one day you will make a connection with it. Read it again after six months. Something will probably change.

 [Facts and Interpretations] 



### Experience self-evident


orthographical variants
　 [Experience reveals] 

[GPT.icon]
	The expression &quot;experientially self-evident&quot; has two meanings: &quot;self-evident&quot; and &quot;experiential. Self-evident&quot; means self-evident or obvious, and &quot;experiential&quot; means based on experience.
 The meaning of &quot;experientially self-evident&quot; is an expression that is self-evident through experience. However, if such an experience cannot be shared, it may not be self-evident to others and may require explanation.
 On the other hand, when others may seek explanations for the &quot;experientially self-evident&quot;, they may not be paying the &quot;cost of experience&quot;. That is, the effort, time, energy, stress, etc., that the experiencer has put into verbalizing his or her experience. In other words, the experiencer is paying a lot of cost to share his or her experience, whereas others are not paying that cost, so such a value is not fair.
 Also, &quot;introducing axioms founded on experience&quot; means to build knowledge and theories on the foundation of axioms based on experience. In the example of gravity, since we are exposed to gravity from birth, the concept of gravity is self-evident and can be introduced as an axiom.


### Digest for stickies
 This kind of [metaknowledge] acquisition works with [compound interest], so I even feel like I should drop everything I'm reading and read this book first.
 I think this book will set the next standard in this field, a field where several great books were published in the age of pen and paper, and as a result, these books are still being read today, although some parts are old. (The foreword also says that this book is intended to be Jiro Kawakita's book for the next 50 years.)
 It is applicable to intellectual activities in general, like &quot;The Art of Intellectual Production&quot; or the KJ method, but some of the explanations and examples are written with software engineers in mind, so it may not be easily accessible to people in other fields (?).

 Putting concrete experiences (e.g., data) into abstract concepts, which are then demonstrated and verified
	Looping this gets you as close to wisdom as possible.
	Let A be the abundance of some data, find patterns in that data. (intuitive thinking), combine the pattern with your experience and find an empirical law (logical thinking), demonstrate and verify
	Connecting the knowledge of Z with the knowledge of Y and finding the gap between the two is the creation of new knowledge


### The trap of 100% understanding
The value of learning is not in the input from reading a book, but in comparing and combining the information gained from that information gathering with one's own previous experience and building on it.
	The way it's combined, there's &quot;Oh, this thing I've been experiencing has a name like that?&quot; or &quot;It contradicts my experience, doesn't it?&quot; and then &quot;It wasn't contradictory,&quot; or there's a gap that hasn't been filled in yet.
 [https://gyazo.com/2f5dd1e84cfed14dd0773b241702ce69]
		'What I experienced' matches the patterns in the books and names the patterns in my experience.
 [https://gyazo.com/78caaf82b122f23174029063e2707767]
		Cases where there is a seeming conflict between what you experienced and the information in the book.
  	By looking at your experience from a different perspective, you can find a new angle.
   It is an opportunity to break down the experience into smaller chunks and understand it in a more detailed way.
 [https://gyazo.com/bc610977bd1bc9384bc549fa1ddeaf50]
		Find gaps between your experience and new information.
  	Feelings I don't quite understand,&quot; etc.
  Becoming aware of the existence of what is lacking encourages the discovery of what fills the deficiency.

It is not expressed that there are two characters, so state that.
Clarify arrows to indicate the passage of time.

### Nodal Point of Thought 2022-03-11
Jun Kuikei
When speaking from experience, new information is always a lower proportion of the information one has compared to old information.

Nishio Hirokazu
People in their natural state tend to do so, so we should consciously increase the weight of new information, or &quot;unlearn,&quot; as they say.
Young people naturally accept the fact that there are things in the world that they do not know, so when they feel something strange, they naturally think, &quot;Could this strange feeling be caused by something I don't know? When they feel something strange, they naturally think, &quot;This discomfort may be caused by something I don't know.
On the other hand, old people often forget this and feel like they &quot;know everything&quot;. When they enter this state, positive feedback hangs over them.
This is due to the fact that even if a young person knows something that the &quot;Mere Old Man, who thinks he knows everything&quot; does not know, he does not try to point it out to him.

 [People who think they know.] 


They both believe that what we're talking about now isn't limited to the elderly.
>N: Old and senile are distinct, so I don't attack people just because they are older.
>K: For example, experience mounting occurs even when young, but is called old age.
I gave specific examples of this &quot;experience mounting&quot; but they were not appropriate.
