I thought it was a comment line if it started with &quot;#&quot;, but I wonder if I shouldn't suddenly feel uncomfortable that I can't use Unicode (UTF-8) without it.„ÄÄDo &quot;#-*-&quot; and &quot;-*-&quot; play some special role?
&lt;&lt;

>>
I guess I should understand that &quot;#-*-&quot; and &quot;-*-&quot; do not have the same role as tags.
&lt;&lt;

The &quot;-*-&quot; is a kind of tag that tells Emacs, a text editor, the character encoding and so on. The expression &quot;# -*- coding:utf8 -*-&quot; tells both Emacs and Python that the file is utf8. According to the entry below, Gauche uses the same method to tell both Emacs and Gauche the encoding.

rubikitch This is also true in Ruby 1.9.
&lt;&lt;
What about Perl or something like that?

*1209093272* It's time to write about &quot;I want to learn programming&quot;.
Recently, I have seen several people who said, &quot;I don't have anything in particular I want to build, but I want to learn programming!&quot; I'm not sure what I want to make, but I want to learn how to program! Many people around them make irresponsible recommendations like &quot;Perl is good&quot; or &quot;Python is good,&quot; so it's easy to be confused by the number of choices. But if you compare programming languages to handsome men, you are like a girl in love. People around you are always saying, &quot;Mr. A of the soccer team is so cool! No, I like Mr. B of the chemistry club for his intelligence! Glasses! White coat! I want to join in the conversation, but I can't decide whether I prefer Mr. A or Mr. B.


It's amazingly ubiquitous! It's heartwarming!


In the essay &lt;a href=&quot;http://cruel.org/freeware/hacker.html&quot;>How To Become A Hacker (How To Become A Hacker)&lt;/a>, the following is said.
>>
If you know only one language, you are not a hacker or even a programmer. You are not a hacker because you must learn a general way of thinking about programming problems that does not depend on one language. To be a true hacker, you must be able to learn a new language in a matter of days by relating the descriptions in the manual to your previous knowledge. This means that you should learn several completely different languages.
&lt;&lt;

In other words, &quot;I love you, A!&quot; and you're not even a programmer when you're dazzled by one person. It's a hacker (or geek, as they call it nowadays?) who has two or three jobs, and when he has some purpose, he calls up the most convenient guy (like having a car) and uses him. It is a hacker (or geek, as they call it nowadays?). And by gaining such experience, you need to learn not specific men, but general &quot;insight into the male creature&quot; and &quot;how to play with men. In other words, geeks are bad girls. Some geeks have a specific steady language, but it's not a geek if you've only ever done that specific language. A geek is the one who picks up other men and then says, &quot;I still like ____.

You're so cool!&quot; When people are saying, &quot;B is so cool! But when they say, &quot;B is cool! is just saying, &quot;(I like) B-kun! It does not mean &quot;You should love Mr. B! It doesn't mean &quot;You are the one to love! You have to find out what it means by yourself, not by having someone tell you. And it is rare to have a lifelong relationship with your first love. Worrying about who to choose first is a waste of time. Maybe worrying and ranting is fun in itself.

------

The people who are ranting and raving around you are irresponsible. The appropriate language depends on what you want to do, and the first question you should ask is, &quot;What do you want to do?&quot; I think the first thing to do is to ask the question, &quot;What do you want to do? JavaScript is not a bad choice, but it is not appropriate if what you want to make is a web service, Python is a good choice, but if what you want to make is a &lt;a Python is also a good choice, but if what you want to do is tinker with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chumby.com/&quot;>chumby&lt;/a>, ActionScript2 or &lt;a href=&quot;http://nadesi.com/about/loadmap200512.htm&quot;>Nadeshiko/Aoi&lt;/a> is probably the way to go. After all, everyone is just saying it because it's a chance to say, &quot;I love you, A-kun! I'm just saying this because it's my chance to say &quot;I love A-kun!

------
http://d.hatena.ne.jp/asami81/20080424/P1
>>
In my case, I think there are some things that I have to learn before I choose a language. I don't know what it is. I don't know what it is.
&lt;&lt;
No, it's not! Not at all! First you pick a language, you chew on it, then you pick another language, you chew on it, then you pick another language, you chew on it, then you learn something that says, &quot;You must learn this one thing! You'll learn something that you're not supposed to learn! The order is backwards!

By the way, advertising.

Java and Python have completely opposite personalities, but they are actually &lt;s>dating&lt;/s>, or rather, they are actually good friends, and although Java himself is very guarded, he can easily access private places via the frank Python. Python is more frank and easy to be friends with than Java. I mean, Python-kun is terrible, he hid it under the bed so that Java-kun wouldn't see it, but he took it out and scattered it around! (>&lt;)
Java wants to clean up and compile, but Python wants to do whatever it wants to do, including inserting a button into a window at runtime and moving a button to another window! Aah!

This is a BL book about the shared life of two handsome men called &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4839922829?tag=nishiohirokaz-22&amp;camp=243&amp;creative=1615&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=4839922829&amp; adid=11J78NXZRK5MG4CHWRZ4&amp;&quot;>Jython programming&lt;/a>. Sorry, it's a lie.

*1209135445*Last train

Oh no. I forgot the time. I also forgot to eat the onigiri I made for lunch. I didn't realize how hungry I was. Has it been more than 12 hours since I made it? Ugh.


It's crowded, but there are no seats available. Is it because I can't get off the train if I sit down? That's not very efficient.
