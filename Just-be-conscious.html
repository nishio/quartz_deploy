Keyword Discussion:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wound: In this context, it is most likely referring to wounds as a symbol of emotional pain and experience, as well as physical injury. Wounds are depicted as a source of growth and learning.
<ul>
<li>Symbol of experience.<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>
<ul>
<li>Good words, “<a href="./Scars-are" class="internal alias" data-slug="Scars-are">Scars are</a> a source of growth and learning.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Drama: Life itself can be viewed as a single drama or story. Many emotions and events - joys, sorrows, setbacks, successes, etc. - are embedded in this drama, suggesting the importance of enjoying it.</li>
<li>Loneliness: Loneliness is one of the basic human emotions, through which we learn the importance of self-awareness and connection with others. The feeling of loneliness leads people to seek deeper connection and empathy.
<ul>
<li>Loneliness is also a “basic human emotion,” so I guess it’s “built into the drama.”<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tears: Tears are the purest expression of emotion and are shed with many emotions, such as joy, sadness, anger, and gratitude. Through tears, one can release emotions, purify the mind, and find the truth.
