<p>Chit Chat Memo</p>
<p>The spread of marijuana</p>
<ul>
<li>If marijuana makes you subjectively happy, then optimizing for the purpose of “maximizing happiness” would mean that smoking marijuana is rational.</li>
<li>Even if there were no health hazard as an individual, it would be reasonable for a country to ban it because if its citizens are happy to smoke drugs and not work, their productivity will go down.
<ul>
<li>That’s assuming that the productivity of the people’s labor is important to the country, but in a world where AI has advanced to the point where it does labor instead, the assumption doesn’t hold true.
<ul>
<li>As the demand for labor declines, the order of people with low labor productivity becomes “work is negative, so take a break”.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As for “the elderly who don’t work anymore,” we still can’t base that on labor productivity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Urban high schools are rife with drugs and girls in your class buying pot.</p>
<ul>
<li>Scary!</li>
<li>But there’s an aspect of vaccine administration that comes from the circulation of stories like this.</li>
<li>People coming out of the countryside to the city for college are in trouble because they haven’t been vaccinated.</li>
<li>It’s also bad enough that contracts become available at age 18.</li>
<li>People who learned in the city return to the countryside to do network business.
<ul>
<li>Ducking by taking advantage of the perception that “someone back from the city has a money-making story to tell.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>network business</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It was the old system of buying and sending a fixed amount money order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s still there now, it’s still there forever.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the value of money is drastically reduced by AI and human relationships become more valuable, the model of complete transformation of human relationships will no longer be viable.</p>
<ul>
<li>Let AI destroy capitalism and there will be no more fraud! ()</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>The word “democracy” is often associated with today’s “<a href="./one-person,-one-vote-democracy" class="internal alias" data-slug="one-person,-one-vote-democracy">one-person, one-vote democracy</a>.”</p>
<ul>
<li>This was not done in the existing <a href="./paper-and-box-voting-system" class="internal alias" data-slug="paper-and-box-voting-system">paper and box voting system</a> simply because it was too difficult to implement a different number of votes for each individual.</li>
<li>Anyone can participate” and “give competent people more say” go hand in hand.</li>
<li>There is no compatibility between “equal say for everyone” and “giving more say to those who are capable.”</li>
<li>The collective decision-making algorithm of “one person votes and chooses the candidate with the most votes” (<a href="./majority-rule" class="internal alias" data-slug="majority-rule">majority rule</a>) is a piece of crap and should be replaced with a better algorithm.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Successful engineers, successful people in a meritocratic society, so they would be more receptive to a meritocratic, performance-based story.</p>
<ul>
<li>That’s right.</li>
<li>Updating “one-person, one-vote democracy” with the phrase “new democracy” means, of course, reducing someone’s voice and giving it to someone else.
<ul>
<li>They’re going to reduce the voice of the elderly, who have little remaining life expectancy, and give it to the child-rearing generation.</li>
<li>People basically rebel when they are about to be deprived, so it’s better to focus on adding new ones.</li>
<li>For example, we could create a budget to support child-rearing, and then have a direct democracy where people with minor children are given a vote proportional to the number of children they have in order to make decisions on how to spend the budget.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The idea that “not voting is wrong” is an old-fashioned assumption.</p>
<ul>
<li>I don’t vote because the agenda on the ballot is not an agenda close to my heart.</li>
<li>If it were a more familiar agenda, people would be more willing to voice their opinions.</li>
<li>Audrey Tan, “<a href="./Open-up-agenda-setting-authority-to-people" class="internal alias" data-slug="Open-up-agenda-setting-authority-to-people">Open up agenda-setting authority to people</a>.”</li>
<li>It is up to each individual to decide how big an agenda they want to participate in.
<ul>
<li>Not everyone needs to participate in national politics.</li>
<li>Many people are more interested in discussions on the scale of cities, districts, etc.</li>
<li>If people want to discuss the color of the roof of the bike shed, they should be free to discuss it.

<p>Whether AI will govern humans</p>
<ul>
<li>This question is a bad question that only vaguely captures “governance” in the first place.
<ul>
<li><a href="./Three-forms-of-government-replacement-by-AI" class="internal alias" data-slug="Three-forms-of-government-replacement-by-AI">Three forms of government replacement by AI</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>AI executes as per the rules set forth.
<ul>
<li>The apparent that this is just DX, and the transfer of human behavior to AI will continue.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A human legislative body sets the rules.
<ul>
<li>There are probably a lot of people who would consider this place OK if they hadn’t given it away.</li>
<li>I’m sure AI will eventually make suggestions to human politicians.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Self-driving cars and insurance</p>
<ul>
<li>Even if self-driving cars are statistically less likely to have accidents than humans and are more reasonable, they won’t be widely used because neither car companies nor AI companies can take the risk of accidental deaths occurring.</li>
<li>No, if there are statistically fewer accidents, then the insurance company just goes in and shoulders the risk.</li>
<li>Even if that solves the problem financially, it doesn’t solve the emotional problem.</li>
<li>The issue of sentiments is ultimately subjective to the individual, so it’s better to solve it with propaganda or something.
<ul>
<li>Like “technophobes who are emotionally repulsed by self-driving cars” and “harmful behavior that hinders the development of society.”</li>
<li>Even if Japan is a little behind, as more and more self-driving cars come into use in China and the U.S., there will be a debate about whether it’s okay to be left behind.
