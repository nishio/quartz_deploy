<ul>
<li>First, this is a concept, not a rule.
<ul>
<li>Anyone who has built a large distributed system knows that it does not work the way it was conceived when it was designed and that adjustments must be made.</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>The optimal design is not determined in advance by rules such as “this is what you should do in this case,” but is revealed after the fact based on knowledge gained through actual operation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Second, the stage is important.
<ul>
<li>If you are reading this in a company of 5-50 people, you should stick to monoliths. Trust me, you will.</li>
<li>If you are a 10,000 person company reading this, you probably have all of these (monolith > app > service > microservice) to some degree!</li>
<li>but my brief thoughts may differ from what your company has done in the past</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Now, diversion. Let’s talk definitions. There exist no exact definitions for these all
services - supporting apps/monoliths, core infra pieces, needed by lots of surface area, core compliance func, possibly not written by app teams (infra maintains them)
microservices - few hundred lines of code, mostly one-offs, likely could/should be library or SDK</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, let’s talk about definitions. Not all of these have exact definitions!</p>
<ul>
<li>Service
<ul>
<li>It supports the application/monolith. It is a core part of the infrastructure.</li>
<li>It is needed in many surface areas. (<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>what surface area are you referring to?)</li>
<li>Core Compliance Functions.</li>
<li>App team may not write (infrastructure team will maintain)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>microservice
<ul>
<li>It is a few hundred lines of code. Mostly one-offs. Likely/should become a library or SDK.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Ok, with all that out of the way, let’s talk why
My thinking basically goes like this
Speed &amp; risk
A. It’s generally easier for entire engineering teams to work inside one big app (think entire site in Rails app) than to reason about the ways in which microservices will fail
B. distributed systems, which you will have as you grow no matter what, are hard enough to reason about with introducing dozens let alone hundreds of microservices that have their own risk profiles
C. as you go fully micro, you need to introduce new concepts to handle the sprawl
D. A big one. Each bespoke infra service or microservice is an extreme version of debt IMV. Code is debt, but services are extreme versions of that. Really think about about what that means for you. Prefer your debt to be literal points of highest leverage not nice to haves</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, let me tell you why. My thinking is basically as follows.</p>
<p>Speed and Risk</p>
<ul>
<li>A. It is generally easier to have the entire engineering team working within one large app than it is to reason about how microservices can fail. (e.g., an entire site is a Rails app, etc.)</li>
<li>B. Distributed systems are necessary no matter what as they grow. However, it is very difficult to deploy dozens or hundreds of microservices with unique risk profiles.</li>
<li>C. To be completely micro, new concepts need to be introduced to handle sprawl.
<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>The need for a layer to manage and connect the growing number of microservices in an unregulated manner.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>D. Key takeaway: in my opinion, tailor-made infrastructure services and microservices are the worst kind of technical debt. Code is a liability, but services are more of a liability.
<ul>
<li>Think carefully about what it means to you. Debt is not something to be assumed on a “nice to have” basis, but rather to achieve the highest leverage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I think a challenge we dist systems engineers have is we really like to not have duplication so we see something being done in a few places and think “let’s just pull this out and make a microservice out of it”.
In theory this is fine. And if done for a few tens of instances, it is fine. When it goes to several dozen microservices or…way worse…across massive company boundaries (think one color service for all of Microsoft/Google/Apple) it becomes less technical and more org challenge
And I know what I’m presenting so many feels like some false dichotomies but in practice I find there are definite tech challenges with microservices, but there are even more org challenges with them</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The challenge we distributed systems engineers have is that we want to avoid duplication. So we look at what is being done in several places and think, “Let’s take this out and create a microservice.</p>
<p>In theory, this is fine. And if it is done for dozens of instances, it is fine.</p>
<p>If it crosses dozens of microservices or, worse, huge corporate boundaries (let’s say, one color service for all of Microsoft/Google/Apple)</p>
<ul>
<li>This is not a technical challenge, but more of an organizational challenge.</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Microsoft, Google, and Apple each have their own “color selection” function in their applications. Theoretically, it is correct to argue that “if we carve it out into microservices, we can avoid code duplication,” but in practice, each company insists on a design that suits their own needs. It requires political, rather than technical, effort to reconcile the conflicting opinions of the stakeholders and reach a consensus.

</ul>
<p>Many will find my assertion to be a <a href="./false-dichotomy" class="internal alias" data-slug="false-dichotomy">false dichotomy</a>. But it is my experience in reality. Microservices have clear technical challenges, but there are even more organizational challenges.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And of all the things I worry about it’s this</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>First, infra (unless company is led by unusually with-it CEO) almost always gets short end of priority stick</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Second, too many services typically leads to a lack of ownership problem and boundary issues</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Third, you introduce even more tooling to deal with too many microservices</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>And most importantly, each microservice that could/should have been a library or sdk or something introduces production risk
more code is indeed overhead, more services is customer facing prod/experience risk. Both approaches have overhead/risk but the % distribution is diff</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this is what I am concerned about.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, infrastructure is almost always a low priority (unless the company is led by a CEO who knows IT very well).</li>
<li>Second, too many services create ownership and boundary issues.
<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>It becomes unclear which team has the authority to change which service and where the boundaries are. Problems arise when people want a fix but don’t know who to tell, or when multiple teams think of each other as “that team is responsible for the fix” and the ball falls between them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Third, more tools will be deployed to deal with too many microservices.</li>
</ul>
<p>And most importantly, each microservice that could/should have been made into a library, SDK, etc. brings its own production risks.
Too much code is certainly an overhead, but too much service is a production/experience risk faced by the customer. Both approaches have overhead and risk, just in different proportions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So this is typically what I recommend</p>
<ol>
<li>Be a monolith as long as possible</li>
<li>Services start in infra for infra reasons, not app eng typically</li>
<li>If breaking out mono, break to large apps, not small services</li>
<li>Think that each new app is a virtual wall in your company</li>
<li>Prefer libraries to microservices where possible
The classic “we introduced a color service” is my favorite extreme example of where I would choose a library over a service. Yes extreme example but hey, it gets very talked about as quintessential example</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore, I recommend the typical method.</p>
<ul>
<li>1: Be a monolith for as long as possible</li>
<li>2: Servitization is initiated by the infrastructure team for reasons on the infrastructure side. It is not initiated by the app engineer side.</li>
<li>3: When breaking away from monoliths, break them up into larger apps rather than smaller services.</li>
<li>4: Consider the new app to be a virtual wall within the company.
<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>The increase in the number of apps will create new “communication barriers” (walls) within the company, and we should be cautious about this.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>5: Prioritize libraries over microservices whenever possible</li>
</ul>
<p>The classic example of “introducing a color service” is one of my favorite extreme examples of choosing libraries over services. It is certainly an extreme example, but it is very much talked about as the quintessential example.</p>
