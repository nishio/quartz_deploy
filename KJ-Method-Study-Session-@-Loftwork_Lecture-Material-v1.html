<ul>
<li>I wrote this first because it is the most important tip for intellectual production!</li>
<li>reason
<ul>
<li>What you didn‚Äôt write down will be gone.</li>
<li>If you try to remember to keep it from disappearing, your brain will be used to ‚Äúremember‚Äù it.
<ul>
<li>That reduces the amount of power available for ‚Äúthinking‚Äù.</li>
<li>When thinking about difficult things, it is important to make sure that your mind is not used for anything other than ‚Äúthinking‚Äù.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Let‚Äôs minimize the cost of writing it down.
<ul>
<li>Some people make the mistake of thinking they have to use a keyboard when there is a keyboard in front of them.</li>
<li>Which means are less costly depends on the person.</li>
<li>If you are better at flicking on your smartphone than typing on the keyboard, you may write things down by flicking</li>
<li>If you are better at handwritten notes, you may handwrite them down</li>
<li>Only you know what you are good at.
<ul>
<li>So it‚Äôs your responsibility to choose the best means.</li>

- I find the KJ method very useful, but there are a lot of inconveniences in doing it on paper! I need good digital stationery!‚Äù Motivation
- Developed and provided free of charge as open source
- I use it to organize my thoughts and give priority to implementing the features I think I need.
- fold a group
- Make the important ones bigger.
- Drawing lines of relationship between things

<li>2012~2013:  <a href="./Technology-Supporting-Coding" class="internal alias" data-slug="Technology-Supporting-Coding">Technology Supporting Coding</a>
<ul>
<li>A book that compares more than 10 programming languages and explains ‚Äúwhat is knowledge that is less likely to become obsolete and has long-term value‚Äù.</li>
<li>I used the KJ method to put this book together.</li>
<li>The fact that the book is still in print seven years after its release in the technical book genre, which often has a short lifespan, is proof that ‚Äúlong-term value‚Äù has been realized.</li>
</ul>

<li>2013, 2014:  <a href="./Kyoto-University-Summer-Design-School" class="internal alias" data-slug="Kyoto-University-Summer-Design-School">Kyoto University Summer Design School</a>
<ul>
<li>Taught the KJ method in a 3-day, 2-night, 12-hour workshop.</li>
<li>I used the KJ method to compile this lecture material.</li>
<li>Motoi‚Äôs discovery of this lecture material was the catalyst for this study session.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2018:  <a href="./The-Intellectual-Production-of-Engineers" class="internal alias" data-slug="The-Intellectual-Production-of-Engineers">The Intellectual Production of Engineers</a>
<ul>
<li>A book that explains how the ‚Äútechnology behind coding‚Äù was created</li>
<li>However, the editorial decision was made that ‚Äúwriting with the KJ method‚Äù alone was too narrow a topic for a book, so we decided to broadly discuss the entire intellectual production process.</li>
<li>It ranked 10th in the overall ranking of Junkudo Ikebukuro‚Äôs main store.

<li><img src="https://gyazo.com/a794bad490de9acd705ba5b914e40960/thumb/1000" alt="image"/></li>
<li>I was happy to hear the bookstore clerk say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not an engineer, but this book was good.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Chapter 5, ‚ÄúHow to organize your thoughts‚Äù is the main KJ method story.
<ul>
<li>I wanted to write more but couldn‚Äôt because of the overall volume of the book.</li>
<li>We received feedback from a newcomer to your company who read the book in advance and found the advice to ‚Äúthink in terms of conflict‚Äù and ‚Äúsimilar to presentation slides‚Äù to be useful.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Probably rather different from the work you usually do.
<ul>
<li>Especially those facilitating workshops where multiple clients do KJ legal things.</li>
<li>There was a preliminary question, ‚ÄúI want to know how to do good facilitation.‚Äù
<ul>
<li>but you are more experienced in that!</li>

<p><a href="./All-data-is-a-lie" class="internal alias" data-slug="All-data-is-a-lie">All data is a lie</a>. Use data knowing it to be a lie. And from that, we can determine the more correct truth. That is the path to judgment. But how can we determine the truth from a lie? It is because, from a different point of view, every piece of data also contains some semblance of the truth.

<li>Mrs. A: ‚ÄúHey, listen, my husband‚Ä¶‚Äù</li>
<li>Bad example (Mr. B)
<ul>
<li>Listen to me for a moment.
<ul>
<li>Mr. B: ‚ÄúYes, yes, in essence, you are saying that ‚Äòthe attitude of the spouse‚Äôs participation in household chores is the problem.‚Äò‚Äù</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you said this, Mr. A wouldn‚Äôt be able to speak the rest of the story.</li>
<li>Mr. B is ‚Äúsomeone who doesn‚Äôt listen.‚Äù</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Good example (Mr. C)
<ul>
<li>Mrs. A: ‚ÄúMy husband thinks I‚Äôm stupid!‚Äù</li>
<li>Mr. C.: ‚ÄúYes, you‚Äôre making fun of me.‚Äù

<li>I don‚Äôt believe as a matter of fact that ‚Äúmy husband is making fun of Mrs. A.‚Äù</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mr. C is taking what Mr. A said to heart.

<li>Good attitude towards people:.
<ul>
<li>‚ÄúListen to what they have to say without assuming, ‚ÄòThis is what they must be trying to say.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The equivalent attitude toward the data is: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a good person.
<ul>
<li>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt just assume, ‚ÄòThis must be happening,‚Äô but look at the data.‚Äù</li>
<li>This is ‚Äúletting the data do the talking.‚Äù</li>

<p>Letting the Data Do the Talking‚Äù in the planning stages of this study session.</p>

<li>
<p>Motoi‚Äôs first consultation email</p>
<ul>
<li>It‚Äôs a skill that belongs to the veteran members of the team.‚Äù</li>
<li>It‚Äôs hard to get that across to our younger members.‚Äù</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nishio‚Äôs first thought.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you‚Äôre talking about how to transfer tacit knowledge.
<ul>
<li>Or, ‚ÄúLanguage at a Cost.‚Äù</li>
<li>Communicate non-verbally by doing things in the same place‚Äù (<a href="./collaboration" class="internal" data-slug="collaboration">collaboration</a> in the <a href="./SECI-Model" class="internal alias" data-slug="SECI-Model">SECI Model</a>).</li>
<li>I think you have two choices.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As to ‚Äúlanguage at a cost:‚Äù
<ul>
<li>Since the veterans actually use the KJ method and find it valuable, why don‚Äôt you ask them to tell you ‚Äúwhy I use the KJ method‚Äù with their own muddled experiences?</li>
<li>If the veteran can‚Äôt afford the time cost of preparing the material, why don‚Äôt the younger members interview the veteran?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>and was about to delve into ‚Äúhow to verbalize it at a cost.‚Äù</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then I saw the detailed data.</p>
<ul>
<li>I asked Mr. Motoi some questions, looked at the results of the pre-survey, and so on.</li>
<li>In many cases, especially younger members are doing the KJ method with their teams.
<ul>
<li>In other words, they are already trying to ‚Äúcommunicate non-verbally by doing it in the same place‚Äù and then there is the current problem</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There are ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand‚Äù, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm scared‚Äù, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know the right answer‚Äù, and ‚ÄúI feel like it‚Äôs too late to ask‚Äù in the survey.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>hypothesis</p>
<ul>

<li>Now let‚Äôs say here‚Äôs a person who doesn‚Äôt know how to ride a bicycle.</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>I can‚Äôt ride a bicycle because I don‚Äôt know how to ride it properly, please tell me!‚Äù</li>
<li>What do we do now?</li>

<p>There‚Äôs a ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do it because I don‚Äôt know the right answer‚Äù kind of opinion in the data.</p>
<ul>
<li>Implicitly assuming that those who have done it know the right answer, I don‚Äôt, and I can‚Äôt do it without being taught.</li>
<li>But your process of learning how to ride a bike wasn‚Äôt reading a textbook or listening to a classroom lecture, was it?</li>
<li>You should have actually straddled the bike in a safe park or something, tried many times, sometimes fell down, and from the repetition you should have learned the knack of moving forward in a stable manner.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another perspective: a line from a veteran who has done the KJ method over 100 times.</p>

<li>Just like how you all ride your bicycles in your own way.

<li>They know that riding a bike will get them around faster than walking.</li>
<li>Ride when you need it.</li>
<li>This is enough for practical purposes.</li>

<li>Birth of the KJ method:.
<ul>
<li>The intellectual production technique created by Jiro Kawakita was given the name ‚ÄúKJ method‚Äù after the fact.</li>
<li>In other words, the KJ method itself is one of Jiro Kawakita‚Äôs self-styled intellectual production techniques.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Need to create a loftwork style.</p>
<ul>
<li>The cultural anthropologist wrote in 1967, ‚ÄúThe Idea Act.‚Äù</li>
<li>The day-to-day work your company is doing in 2022</li>
<li>There is a huge gap between the two.
<ul>
<li>Different objectives, different tools used.
<ul>
<li>There‚Äôs lots of talk about paper diaries and labels in ‚ÄúIdeas,‚Äù but no mention of computers, because it‚Äôs a book from 1967.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trying to apply it to day-to-day operations
<ul>
<li>Read ‚ÄúIdeas.‚Äù</li>
<li>Discarding detailed specific methods,</li>
<li>Extracting the essence as an intellectual production technique,</li>
<li>It is necessary to achieve this using modern tools</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Too high a hurdle for new employees?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you want to improve the training of new employees, you need to update the ‚Äúidea method‚Äù to the modern and your company‚Äôs context.
<ul>
<li>Updating to a modern context is also in line with what Nishio wants to do, so we can cooperate.

<li>Updating to your context requires tightly coupled knowledge of your business
<ul>
<li>So this is what your company‚Äôs members should do.</li>

<li>In order to resolve the ‚Äúatmosphere of not being able to ask because it feels like it‚Äôs too late,‚Äù a survey was conducted in the form of ‚Äúoutside lecturers are being sought for the preparation of lecture materials.
<ul>
<li>It is impossible &amp; useless to answer this question orally in a limited time, so answer it in text before and after.</li>

<li>Even if the goal is to ride bicycles without auxiliary wheels on public roads in the future, I wouldn‚Äôt challenge that in the beginning.</li>
<li>First, experience ‚Äúpedaling a bicycle to go forward.</li>

- [The term ‚ÄúKJ method‚Äù is vague.
- <img src="https://gyazo.com/a267bec405e211196d0566cec5be6fae/thumb/1000" alt="image"/>
- 1: The KJ method was released in 1967, beginning with the ‚ÄúIdea Method‚Äù.
- The purpose of this method was to ‚Äúsummarize‚Äù the large amount of qualitative data gathered through fieldwork to find out what <img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/Jiro Kawakita/icon" alt="Jiro Kawakita.icon" height="19.5"/> wanted to know
- 2: The ‚ÄúIdea Method‚Äù became a hot topic <img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/Jiro Kawakita/icon" alt="Jiro Kawakita.icon" height="19.5"/>, and in the process of teaching the KJ method to others, he came to believe that the KJ method could be applied to various purposes.
- And it was applied to a wide variety of purposes by <img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/Jiro Kawakita/icon" alt="Jiro Kawakita.icon" height="19.5"/> himself and those around him
- Because the objectives are different, the methods are also slightly different.
- <img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/Â∑ùÂñúÁî∞‰∫åÈÉé/icon" alt="Â∑ùÂñúÁî∞‰∫åÈÉé.icon" height="19.5"/>uses the term ‚Äú<a href="./KJ-method-in-the-narrow-sense" class="internal alias" data-slug="KJ-method-in-the-narrow-sense">KJ method in the narrow sense</a>‚Äù to refer to the original KJ method to distinguish it from these many different KJ legal methods.
- However, this is ambiguous when there are multiple narrowly-defined KJ methods, so I decided to call it ‚Äú<a href="./Beginning-KJ-method" class="internal alias" data-slug="Beginning-KJ-method">Beginning KJ method</a>‚Äù on this page.
- 3: One of the many and varied applications of the KJ method is the ‚ÄúKJ legal workshop‚Äù.
- <img src="https://gyazo.com/bb9caf5ba9dfdf8337ea2a94969d3b94/thumb/1000" alt="image"/>
- Image of a workshop where a large number of ‚Äúpeople who have never studied the KJ method‚Äù are gathered, their ideas are written on sticky notes, and everyone discusses them together in groups in a lively manner.
- The nature of the KJ method, which is ‚Äúdone for a large number of people who have never studied KJ before,‚Äù made this the ‚Äúfirst experience with KJ‚Äù for many people.
- As a result, a lot of people recognized that ‚Äúthis is the KJ method.‚Äù
- However, this ‚ÄúKJ legal workshop‚Äù is at odds with <img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/Jiro Kawakita/icon" alt="Jiro Kawakita.icon" height="19.5"/>‚Äòs ‚ÄúBeginning KJ method‚Äù in many ways
- <img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/Â∑ùÂñúÁî∞‰∫åÈÉé/icon" alt="Â∑ùÂñúÁî∞‰∫åÈÉé.icon" height="19.5"/> <a href="./The-KJ-method-is-not-powerful-without-individual-work." class="internal alias" data-slug="The-KJ-method-is-not-powerful-without-individual-work.">The KJ method is not powerful without individual work.</a>
- <img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/Â∑ùÂñúÁî∞‰∫åÈÉé/icon" alt="Â∑ùÂñúÁî∞‰∫åÈÉé.icon" height="19.5"/> <a href="./50-KJ-method-assumes-10-hours" class="internal alias" data-slug="50-KJ-method-assumes-10-hours">50 KJ method assumes 10 hours</a>
- So people who recognize this ‚ÄúKJ legal workshop‚Äù as ‚ÄúKJ method‚Äù will be confused when they read <img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/Jiro Kawakita/icon" alt="Jiro Kawakita.icon" height="19.5"/>‚Äòs book
- KJ method‚Äù is a low-resolution language, so it is necessary to improve the resolution of the language.</p>

<li>The majority of participants in the participant survey used it more often with their teams.

<ul>
<li>Jiro Kawakita believes that this problem has emerged due to the widespread use of the KJ method, which is done in groups.
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>If you have only experienced group KJ method from the beginning, it is difficult to develop the basic ability to do individual work‚Ä¶ Moreover, they feel like they have somehow mastered the KJ method because they have only done it in groups many times. They do not realize that they have not mastered the KJ method. (<a href="./KJ-method-Let-the-chaos-speak-for-itself" class="internal alias" data-slug="KJ-method-Let-the-chaos-speak-for-itself">KJ method Let the chaos speak for itself</a> p.209)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Jiro Kawakita believed that ‚Äúmembers working in pairs must have gained experience and matured in competence as individuals first, or undesirable compromises will occur.
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Around 1968, a training program was initiated in which two people work in pairs to assemble labels. However, this work was conducted only in the third round (pursuit of essence), after the first round (problem posing) and the second round (understanding the situation) of labeling work had been conducted on the same theme, one after the other after having experienced this work on an individual basis. It was only in this third round that the participants succeeded in working in flexible pairs for the first time. Prior to this, I judged that the individual competence of each person was not mature enough. It seemed to me that operationally speaking, an undesirable compromise would occur between the two of us. (p.201)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is an ‚Äúundesirable compromise?‚Äù
<ul>
<li>For example, let‚Äôs say that a senior who is familiar with KJ method and a junior who is not familiar with KJ method are paired up to do KJ method.</li>
<li><img src="https://gyazo.com/e249b88f436ff3bf9d15d99579239ae5/thumb/1000" alt="image"/></li>
<li>When the senior says, ‚ÄúThis is a circle,‚Äù the junior says, ‚ÄúFrom my point of view it looks like a square?‚Äù Can he say, ‚ÄúFrom my point of view, it looks like a square?</li>
<li>(Is it round? I think it‚Äôs square‚Ä¶ but if senpai says it‚Äôs round, maybe that‚Äôs right‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs right‚Ä¶) just because I don‚Äôt know what it is?
<ul>
<li>This is an undesirable compromise.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If anxiety prevents us from having a multifaceted opinion, we will not be able to ‚Äú<a href="./From-a-360-degree-viewing-angle" class="internal alias" data-slug="From-a-360-degree-viewing-angle">From a 360-degree viewing angle</a>‚Äù.
<ul>
<li>Data showed that ‚Äúwhen you‚Äôre a loner, you feel alienated.‚Äù
<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>What? [The lone wolf is worth it. What do you mean you feel alienated? Is there a tonal pressure to be like everyone else?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Seniors have the responsibility to control the atmosphere of the place so that juniors can express their opinions without anxiety.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So let‚Äôs do it alone first.</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>‚ÄòI‚Äôve only done it with a team; I can‚Äôt imagine doing it alone.‚Äô

<li>Introduced from the preliminary survey</li>
<li><img src="https://gyazo.com/41403cc7feaade90ef2eb28b69d0e47c/thumb/1000" alt="image"/></li>
<li>There are a lot of people who use it for brainstorming, and at one step, there are people who are aware of the problem of ‚Äústopping at brainstorming and not being able to put it in writing.‚Äù</li>
<li>On the flip side, some people say they use it for writing articles and blogs.
<ul>
<li>In other words, they use it for the purpose of ‚Äúmaking sentences.‚Äù</li>
<li>This is similar to the ‚ÄúKJ method of beginnings‚Äù of [Jiro Kawakita.icon
<ul>
<li>He used to compile a lot of data and put it in writing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Close to Nishio‚Äôs experience.
<ul>
<li>I used the slides for my lecture material and for writing my book.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>Some said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not writing, I‚Äôm making slides.‚Äù
- Jiro Kawakita explains that there are only two ways to ‚Äúnarrativization‚Äù: ‚Äúwritten‚Äù and ‚Äúoral presentation (with illustrations)‚Äú.
- Does not include making slides in PowerPoint or Keynote
- But slide making is a form of narrativization.<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>
- The only reason it‚Äôs not mentioned is because those presentation tools had not yet been created in 1967.
- In fact, a number of people have commented in their experience with <img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/> so far that ‚Äúimagining the slide-making process made group organization easier.</li>
<li>Doing it for the specific purpose of writing makes it easier to learn the method.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Achievement of one job fosters both people and teams.</p>
<ul>
<li>There are many other kinds of work besides making texts and slides.
<ul>
<li>The purpose of the ‚ÄúBeginning KJ Method‚Äù was to write.</li>
<li>Later, ‚ÄúIt can be applied to various purposes,‚Äù and the KJ legal method in a broad sense was derived.</li>
<li>As a result, the ‚Äúpurpose of the KJ method‚Äù became vague and more people felt unsure</li>

<li>I don‚Äôt know if these words ‚Äúaxis‚Äù and ‚Äúgranularity‚Äù are used in the sense that <img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/> thinks they are, or if they are used in a specific sense within your company.</li>
<li>So I emailed Motoi and asked him about it. When I read the text of his reply, it was clear.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Easiest to do with self-derived labels, much harder to do with anonymous survey-derived labels.
<ul>
<li>So this time I‚Äôll do it with a label of my own origin.</li>
<li>It appears that your company often uses the KJ method to compile ‚Äú100 or more‚Äù labels of ‚Äúsurvey origin‚Äù for business needs.</li>
<li>I guess if you have to, you have to do it, but you should realize that you‚Äôre taking on something very difficult.</li>
<li>It seems too spartan to make someone unfamiliar with the KJ method do it for the purpose of learning it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I‚Äôm going to do an exploratory net.
- <a href="./Expedition-Net" class="internal alias" data-slug="Expedition-Net">Expedition Net</a> (aka: Fireworks)

- KJ legal methods created for practical purposes
- Since the purpose is different, it is only natural that the method should be different from the ‚ÄúKJ method of beginnings‚Äù (see <a href="./The-flow-of-birth-of-fireworks-to-think-about" class="internal alias" data-slug="The-flow-of-birth-of-fireworks-to-think-about">The flow of birth of fireworks to think about</a>).
- <img src="https://gyazo.com/cff575dca22b831cce37e9053c3a77d0/thumb/1000" alt="image"/>
- How exactly are they different?
- In one round of the narrowly defined KJ method (Chapter 4), the table tag creation is done as an element of group organization, and then spatial arrangement is done as an element of diagramming (p. 123).
- <img src="https://gyazo.com/1774d1af2641ba655a83f27784a3c521/thumb/1000" alt="image"/>
- The exploratory net is spatial arrangement as an element of net building, and table tag making as an element of integrated illustration (p. 289).
- <img src="https://gyazo.com/b70c91c7f28b1073f866baf8dba77b84/thumb/1000" alt="image"/>
- Elements are swapped back and forth.</p>
<ul>
<li>Group formation is not necessary in practice.
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>The first system of KJ method introduced to the world was the six-round cumulative KJ method. This created the perception that problem solving by the KJ method was time consuming. (p.436)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Jiro Kawakita himself has made about 1,000 pieces in the five years since 1981, but only 8 of them are in the 6-round KJ method (p.436).
<ul>
<li><img src="https://gyazo.com/2bf75f74885b4c9e5ecfb8a633a3ddae/thumb/1000" alt="image"/></li>
<li>I only do the 6 round KJ method once or twice a year.
<ul>
<li>We only work on topics that require six months to a year to reach a conclusion.</li>
<li>In Nishio‚Äôs example, a theme like ‚Äúwriting a book‚Äù.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I do a light KJ method about once every two weeks.</li>
<li>I make about one exploration net (thinking fireworks) every two or three days.
<ul>
<li>Accounts for about 90% of all cases.</li>
<li>In other words, in most cases, they‚Äôre not grouped together.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>So ‚Äúgroup formation is always necessary‚Äù is an assumption contrary to the data</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>So when is grouping necessary?
<ul>
<li>Quite simply, ‚Äúwhen there are too many sheets.‚Äù<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/></li>
<li>Direct spatial placement is not possible due to the large number of sheets.</li>
<li>therefore
<ul>
<li>Look at the whole picture and ‚Äúattach what seems relevant.‚Äù</li>
<li>Give the group a ‚Äúnameplate‚Äù that represents its content.</li>
<li>Bundle bundle with the nameplate at the top.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><img src="https://gyazo.com/23cbfbf14fc93c8cecb5eac7dac0cd3d/thumb/1000" alt="image"/></li>
<li>Some people are misled by the term ‚Äúgrouping.‚Äù<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>
<ul>
<li>I wonder if the word ‚Äúgroup‚Äù makes them feel like they have to form a group of, say, seven or something.</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/human/icon" alt="human.icon" height="19.5"/>Some things just don‚Äôt fit anywhere.‚Äù

<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>First is the feeling of putting two pieces together.
<ul>
<li>It‚Äôs not uncommon for a piece attached in two pieces to be further attached later to increase the number of pieces.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/Â∑ùÂñúÁî∞‰∫åÈÉé/icon" alt="Â∑ùÂñúÁî∞‰∫åÈÉé.icon" height="19.5"/>Some sets of labels consist of two labels, and some sets consist of three labels. <a href="./Some" class="internal" data-slug="Some">Some</a> have a set of four or five labels.
<ul>
<li>There is a case in <img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/Jiro Kawakita/icon" alt="Jiro Kawakita.icon" height="19.5"/>‚Äòs experience where the average number of sheets was 13 as a result of sticking together, but we consider that to be an exceptional event.</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>In this example, the small group of units in the first stage averaged a little less than 13 pieces. In this example, the number of units in the first small group averaged just under 13, but this was due to the fact that there were quite a few units in the field data collected that should unquestionably be in one group‚Ä¶ It is normal for a group to include as many as four or five pieces of paper or units. (Continued from Ideas, p.72)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The main focus of this ‚Äúputting two pieces together‚Äù is the ‚Äúexploratory net.‚Äù</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Different tools have their strengths and weaknesses</p>
<ul>
<li>Everyone in this study group uses Miro, which is an interesting situation.
<ul>
<li>You do a lot of things on paper, often because the client‚Äôs IT literacy is spotty.<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Explore net explicitly expresses the relationship between the two labels
<ul>
<li>This is hard to do with paper labels.
<ul>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/Â∑ùÂñúÁî∞‰∫åÈÉé/icon" alt="Â∑ùÂñúÁî∞‰∫åÈÉé.icon" height="19.5"/>is a tearful device, such as ‚Äúplacing a clipüìé between</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We can easily achieve this with Miro‚Äôs ‚ÄúDraw a line between stickies‚Äù feature.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>So there will be a lot to learn if we all take this opportunity to do an exploratory net together.</li>
<li>This time, we‚Äôll do something based on ‚ÄúThinking Fireworks‚Äù, one of several variations of ‚ÄúExploration Net‚Äù, customized to fit the constraints of this study group.
<ul>
<li>The original ‚ÄúThinking Fireworks‚Äù will surely be useful for your work, so if you are interested, please read the explanations on p.304-311 of <a href="./KJ-method-Let-the-chaos-speak-for-itself" class="internal alias" data-slug="KJ-method-Let-the-chaos-speak-for-itself">KJ method Let the chaos speak for itself</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Place the theme in the middle and spread it out in a 360-degree direction.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, write the theme with one large label in the middle.</li>
<li>Add a new label for something associated with this theme, connect it with a line, add another new label for something associated with that label, and repeat.
- If you have experience with <a href="./mind-map" class="internal" data-slug="mind-map">mind-map</a>, it may be easier to imagine writing associations and connecting them.
<ul>
<li>Mind maps create a tree structure, but exploration nets create a mesh (see below).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This time I had the labels pre-written.
<ul>
<li>If you put time pressure on writing out the label, you may create a messy label in a hurry, which may cause all the later phases to be messed up. We wanted to avoid that (SEE <a href="./Don't-put-time-pressure-on-label-creation." class="internal alias" data-slug="Don't-put-time-pressure-on-label-creation.">Don‚Äôt put time pressure on label creation.</a>)</li>
<li>When expanding the associations from the theme, glance at the existing labels and pick up and connect any labels that seem to be connected.</li>
<li>The goal is not to ‚Äúhook up everything we‚Äôve prepared in advance.‚Äù
<ul>
<li>If you can use it, you can use it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Purpose of this time</p>
<ul>
<li>„ÄúIt‚Äôs not a ‚Äù~.
<ul>
<li>It‚Äôs not about ‚Äúconnecting all the pre-prepared labels.‚Äù</li>
<li>It‚Äôs not about ‚Äúputting the data together nicely.‚Äù</li>
<li>Nor is it ‚Äúmaking pretty diagrams.‚Äù</li>
<li>Nor is it ‚Äúslurred speech.‚Äù</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To notice something that you have not noticed before.
<ul>
<li>This could be an ‚Äúidea‚Äù or ‚Äúfinding a solution to a problem‚Äù.</li>
<li>If you notice any one thing that is new to you, you‚Äôve succeeded.</li>
<li>Some will find it difficult, it‚Äôs important to be able to think this is ‚Äúdoable‚Äù.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Representing relationships with lines to create a mesh-like structure.</p>
<ul>
<li>The exploratory net does not organize groups, but rather expresses the relationship between the two pieces with a line.</li>
<li>Many people have trouble organizing groups for the KJ method, but you can get the hang of it by doing an exploratory net.
<ul>
<li>Instead of ‚Äúgrouping,‚Äù ‚Äúcategorizing,‚Äù ‚Äúcategorizing,‚Äù or ‚Äúcreating an axis,‚Äù attach two pieces that seem related.</li>
<li>also place opposing labels close together.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Place the label in a place where it will draw lots of lines with its surroundings.
<ul>
<li>Lines should be as short as possible.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This process creates this kind of mesh (net).
<ul>
<li>
<p><img src="https://gyazo.com/6dca2378f76b52d352b8c985e17034f9/thumb/1000" alt="image"/></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I actually made it on the Miro board you all are looking at.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the time the mesh was created, it was not divided into groups.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the process of creating a mesh, for example, you may say, ‚ÄúI thought I was thinking in terms of multiple aspects, but when I put them together, there are gaps around the themes.
<ul>
<li>What fills this gap?‚Äù Prompting awareness by asking ‚ÄúWhat fills this gap?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the mesh is created, pen around each of the two or three pieces.</p>
<ul>
<li>Surround the area with two to three pieces, four to five at most.
<ul>
<li>This is the equivalent of collecting labels for the KJ method.</li>
<li>Anything that does not fit well anywhere may of course be left in one piece (lone wolf).</li>
<li>(In Miro) I thought it would be good to use a frame, but it was hard to do, so I decided to enclose it with a pen.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Once enclosed, summarize and give a title (nameplate)
<ul>
<li>How would you summarize it?‚Äù Asking the question ‚ÄúHow can I summarize this?</li>
<li>Unlike the narrowly defined KJ method, there is no bundling, so there is no restriction that ‚Äúthe meaning must be known only by the nameplate‚Äù (SEE <a href="./Mission-of-the-nameplate" class="internal alias" data-slug="Mission-of-the-nameplate">Mission of the nameplate</a>).
<ul>
<li>Even if you make some mistakes, you can summarize them comfortably because you know what they mean when you read what‚Äôs in them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Repeat this ‚Äúenclose and put a nameplate‚Äù until there are 5 or 6 enclosures.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pay attention to what you notice and make it into a narrative</p>
<ul>
<li>When the work is done, first take a break and carefully appreciate the whole process.
<ul>
<li>You can add anything you come up with in the process.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Then, make it descriptive.
<ul>
<li>No need to write long, clean sentences.</li>
<li>That‚Äôs not what we‚Äôre here for.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Repost: The purpose of this time is ‚Äúto notice something new for me, even if it is just one thing.‚Äù
<ul>
<li>So pay attention to ‚Äúwhat you notice‚Äù and put it into words.</li>
<li>Narrativization also has different ways of doing things depending on the purpose. by<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/Â∑ùÂñúÁî∞‰∫åÈÉé/icon" alt="Â∑ùÂñúÁî∞‰∫åÈÉé.icon" height="19.5"/>
<ul>
<li>Narrative for reporting of facts collected
<ul>
<li>Many of you may be used to this, but that is not the purpose of this project.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/Â∑ùÂñúÁî∞‰∫åÈÉé/icon" alt="Â∑ùÂñúÁî∞‰∫åÈÉé.icon" height="19.5"/>Narrating for Ideas‚Äù (p. 141)
<ul>
<li>Put more and more of what you notice and ideas that come to mind into writing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It is not important to report the whole picture of the ex-labels in this study session
<ul>
<li>So, let‚Äôs focus on ‚Äúawareness‚Äù as the main part of the story and explain only the minimum necessary labels.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why is awareness valuable?
<ul>
<li>Because that‚Äôs what ‚Äúthe bike moves forward.‚Äù</li>
<li>Repeating the same things we‚Äôve been doing won‚Äôt solve the problem.</li>
<li>Reaffirming what you already know hasn‚Äôt taught you anything.</li>
<li>In order to move forward, it is necessary to realize the goodness of ‚Äúthings that go against conventional thinking‚Äù.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Constraints of this study session</p>
<ul>
<li>The ideal theme is what I am struggling with right now.
<ul>
<li>But you don‚Äôt want to share that with others.</li>
<li>For example, if you‚Äôre serious about your career, ‚Äúchanging jobs‚Äù is an option you should consider, but you don‚Äôt want to discuss whether or not to change jobs in front of some of your colleagues.</li>
<li>Priority was given to the benefits of seeing other people‚Äôs work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ideally, there should be no time limit.
<ul>
<li>The experience of thinking carefully until you are satisfied is beneficial.</li>
<li>Some people try to look presentable in the eyes of others when they have a presentation scheduled after a certain time.</li>
<li>The purpose is to think hard and gain some new insights.</li>
<li>Prioritized the benefits of listening to other people‚Äôs insights.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It is difficult to align the time required for a large number of people.
<ul>
<li>Some are fast, some are slow.</li>
<li>It‚Äôs not always the slow people who are bad, there are those who sass up their appearances without thinking twice about it.
<ul>
<li>It‚Äôs like buzzing a bicycle around with the stand up, you can turn it faster because there‚Äôs no load on it, and you‚Äôre not going to move forward by doing that.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In this case, we‚Äôll say, ‚ÄúIf the label didn‚Äôt reticulate in the first 30 minutes, we‚Äôll leave it alone and move on.
<ul>
<li>The idea of adjusting time by reducing the number of sheets for slow people</li>
<li>People who spend too much time trying to ‚Äúuse it all‚Äù end up rushing and doing the crucial second half in a messy way, which is not good.
<ul>
<li>I would rather not be able to use all of the labels than to make the second half a chore, so I prioritized taking my time in the second half over ‚Äúusing all of the labels‚Äù.</li>
<li>If you don‚Äôt have time constraints, you‚Äôre really better off challenging yourself to use all the labels.
<ul>
<li>Because the question, ‚ÄúHow can this be connected?‚Äù prompts awareness.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>People with extra time
<ul>
<li>You should take the time to watch it and add as much as you can think of.
<ul>
<li>This is how <img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/Jiro Kawakita/icon" alt="Jiro Kawakita.icon" height="19.5"/> also recommends</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can go and watch other people work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After this study session is over, I want you to take the time to do it alone, on a subject you really want to think about, without worrying about what others think.
<ul>
<li>This experience is very important for ‚ÄúKJ legal thinking to become clear‚Äù.<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/></li>
