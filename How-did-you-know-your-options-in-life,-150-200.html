<p>I met a girl who was transferring to a high school right after high school and found out about the overseas education. I studied abroad for a short period of time and found it to be a good fit for me. My homeroom teacher graduated from a graduate school and my friends were planning to go to various countries, so I was able to talk to them about it and there were information sessions at school about going to universities abroad, so I was able to make my choice. twitter.com/nishio/status/‚Ä¶</p>
