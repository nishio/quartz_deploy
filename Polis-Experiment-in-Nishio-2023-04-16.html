<li>Let’s do a few casual experiments with this first.</li>
</ul>
<p>Need to write an explanatory note.</p>
<p>explanation</p>
<ul>
<li>The Polis was created as a tool for better democracy, but Nishio feels that it works as a tool that gives people the opportunity to think better. In order to verbalize this hunch in more detail, we decided that we needed to experience Polis more.</li>
<li>Not all of the following questions are Nishio’s opinion, some of which Nishio voted against.</li>
<li>You can vote anonymously. You can post a new comment when you have voted for all of them. You must be connected to a social networking site to post.</li>
<li>At the appropriate time, terminate and start the next experiment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Initial list of opinions prepared</p>
<ul>
<li>Good democracy requires good debate before voting</li>
<li>Tools that support good discussion are useful even if there is no vote afterwards</li>
<li>If 100 people try to have a productive discussion, each individual must hear 100 times as much as he or she speaks, but not in a naive way</li>
<li>Free social networking sites like Twitter that are paid for and maintained by advertisers are not a forum for better discussion.</li>
<li>Instead of attacking those who submit opinions that differ from yours, it is better to submit a better opinion</li>
<li>When AI becomes smarter than a majority of humans, majority rule by voting will be a foolish way to govern.</li>
<li>An environment where it is difficult to see opinions that differ from one’s own accelerates the belief that one’s own opinion is correct.</li>
<li>Should not be able to write long sentences</li>
<li>You should be able to add links to external sites.</li>
<li>After voting (like Kotonoha), you should be able to add a comment about it.</li>
<li>You want to talk about why you voted the way you did because it promotes verbalization, so you should let people verbalize without hindering them.</li>
<li>It’s better to be able to express opposition to the proposal anonymously.</li>
<li>Some people change their opinions when they are made visible that they are a minority.</li>
<li>It is unnecessarily burdensome to read a lengthy proposal written by one person and then respond to it with a verbal opinion.</li>
<li>Besides “for” and “against,” I’d like to see “moyamoya.”</li>
<li>It’s better to disclose to yourself and only yourself where your opinion stands.</li>
<li>Voting should be able to be changed later.</li>
</ul>

<p>Already at about 20 people, there was a realization that “I see.

<ul>
<li>Useful if there is a large variance in opinion among a small group of people.</li>
<li>If it is to be used for national politics, it is useful to pose that “I have heard many people’s opinions”, but if the purpose is to “increase my intellectual productivity”, which is my current interest, it would be good to have a closed polis with a few people whom I trust.</li>
</ul>

<p>First, the majority opinion, the one that says, “I guess we’re all on the same page when it comes to this opinion.
<img src="https://gyazo.com/d0fe72993137fda601f9d4ce8b296da8/thumb/1000" alt="image"/>
I saw this and thought, “Okay, so everyone agrees on the point that ‘some people will change their opinions if they are made visible that they are a minority’, so the question we should ask is whether that is a good thing or a bad thing?” so I added the question.</p>
<h2 id="cluster-of-opinions">Cluster of Opinions<a role="anchor" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" data-no-popover="true" href="#cluster-of-opinions" class="internal"><svg width="18" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a></h2>

<ul>
<li>This shows that A’s are of the opinion that we should not prevent people from using language, that we should be able to add links to external sites, that we should add moyamoya buttons other than for and against, and that we should be able to write long sentences.
<ul>
<li>C, on the other hand, has almost the exact opposite opinion</li>
<li>By the way, I’m a C, so I thought, “Oh, I’m in the minority,” and “I need to verbalize exactly why I think it’s better not to do that.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I didn’t think the report was going to be updated, so I didn’t have any screenshots taken at a specific point in time.</p>
<ul>
<li>Group 2 versions</li>
<li><img src="https://gyazo.com/447e3f549dcd1732628736d8896ec732/thumb/1000" alt="image"/></li>
<li>I should have taken a scribble and written a commentary as soon as I thought it was interesting.
<ul>
<li>The function of this opinion group was more fluid than expected</li>
<li>We had the ability to add questions to anyone’s list, so the dynamic changes in response to new questions.
<ul>
<li>Groups can go to four or back to two.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It’s not so much a partisan thing as it is a temporary visualization of the opposing sides of the debate.</li>

Opinions of more than 30% of the population pass
I thought the description was spot on: “It will be a catalyst for education and dialogue with the community.”
The good thing is that “I don’t know” is a voting option, and it visualizes how many people chose it.</p>

It is easy to answer because it is “agree/disagree/neither.
I also thought it would be a good exercise in “thinking” because there are so many questions, so the answers are less partisan.</p>
