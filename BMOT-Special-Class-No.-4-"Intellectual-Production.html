<p>Sometimes what you speak without taking notes is forgotten later.</p>

<p>Questions from the audience that didn’t fit well were naturally forgotten.
I think there would be a difference between the two. Which is better suited for rereading: reconstructed notes or transcription?</p>

<pre><code>- What is [analogy
- Analogy is finding a subjectively similar relationship to an object with which there is no objective or logical relationship
- For example, there is no logical relationship whatsoever between an increase in the price of a commodity and an increase in the price of a tako-age kite.
- But we find a similar relationship in this.
- Then develop it in the metaphorical space and then pull it back.
    - Kites fly because the wind blows.
    - So what does that &quot;wind&quot; equate to in terms of the price of the product?
    - Customer attention?
- If the wind is too strong, the string will break and fly away.
    - What does this equate to in terms of commodity prices?
    - To be priced at a premium?
    - That the supply of goods cannot keep up?
    - It's a subjective relationship, so there are a number of answers.

<p>Question from the audience How do you put together what you have expanded by analogy and association?</p>
<ul>
<li>In a word, KJ method
<ul>
<li>write out</li>
<li>Make it possible to list</li>
<li>Grouping</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Unlike when they diverge, this process is done quietly, alone.

</li>
<li>Is one page in Scrapbox equivalent to one sticky note?
<ul>
<li>not match the correct (answer, etc.)</li>
<li>I made the same mistake when I started using Scrapbox.</li>
<li>But the sticky note is a much smaller unit.
<ul>
<li>The <a href="./information-card" class="internal alias" data-slug="information-card">information card</a> is B6 size, and <a href="./Tadao-Umesao" class="internal alias" data-slug="Tadao-Umesao">Tadao Umesao</a> thought it could not be used as a substitute for a full-fledged notebook if it were smaller than this.</li>
</ul>

<li>On the other hand, he used a B8 size <a href="./small-stature" class="internal alias" data-slug="small-stature">small stature</a> for temporary processing when thinking about a sentence</li>
<li>A page in Scrapbox is a large unit, a sticky note is a small unit</li>
