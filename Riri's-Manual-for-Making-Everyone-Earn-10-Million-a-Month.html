<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/claude/icon" alt="claude.icon" height="19.5"/>The main points are as follows: 1.
- Play the role of a <a href="./pure" class="internal" data-slug="pure">pure</a> and idealistic woman in order to build a <a href="./relationship-of-mutual-trust" class="internal alias" data-slug="relationship-of-mutual-trust">relationship of mutual trust</a>. Invite <a href="./sympathy" class="internal" data-slug="sympathy">sympathy</a> by weaving in past traumas, dreams and goals, <a href="./weakness" class="internal" data-slug="weakness">weakness</a>, etc.</p>
<ul>
<li>Frequent contact and making the man feel special. Emotionally move men with favorable words and actions.</li>
<li>Before talking about money, skillfully lead the man to say that he wants to help. Be careful not to make the man think you are after his money.</li>
<li>The specific amount will be gradually increased. Start with a few tens of thousands of yen. Induce sympathy in settings such as debt troubles.</li>
<li>Continue to follow up generously after receiving money and maintain a trusting relationship. Repeat requests for money on a regular basis.</li>
<li>Control men‚Äôs emotions and psychologically manipulate them so that they do not feel <a href="./feelings-of-guilt" class="internal alias" data-slug="feelings-of-guilt">feelings of guilt</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Be aware of these tactics and be wary of women who try to be overly intimate with you. If you are asked for money, firmly refuse the request and, if necessary, consult the police.
On the other hand, there are women who truly need help. It is important to be calm enough to carefully assess their true intentions.</p>

<p>„ÉªWhat is the value that the old man (customer) wants? How to provide it?</p>

<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/claude/icon" alt="claude.icon" height="19.5"/>Ms. Nakano‚Äôs thread raises alarms about the malicious business practices described in one of the manuals that ‚Äútarget lonely uncles.
The main points can be summarized as follows</p>
<ol>
<li>the manual describes a technique for taking money from lonely uncles by offering them value that they want and by playing the role of a girl who makes them want to help her.</li>
<li>it is said that it is difficult to target high attribute uncles because many of them are takers (one-sided profit takers) with psychopathic tendencies, and that you should target givers (one-sided givers) and matchers (those who prefer equivalent exchange).</li>
<li>it is also characteristic that the money is used for host clubs.</li>
<li>hedging risk by narrowing the target to ‚Äú<a href="./harmless-uncle" class="internal alias" data-slug="harmless-uncle">harmless uncle</a>‚Äù.</li>
<li>the tactics of the Takijo are such that one doubts humanity, but there is a suggestion that one should deal with the Matcher rather than the Giver, both in relationships and in business.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think Mr. Nakano‚Äôs message is that givers are easily exploited and that a matcher‚Äôs viewpoint, which demands a moderate return, is also necessary. I felt that the message was that givers are easily exploited and that it is necessary to have a matcher‚Äôs viewpoint that seeks reward in moderation.</p>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Summarize the parts that are helpful from a business perspective</p>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/claude/icon" alt="claude.icon" height="19.5"/>The following is a summary of the areas of reference from a business perspective.</p>
<ol>
<li>it is important to accurately grasp the needs and desires of customers and provide value that meets them.</li>
<li>target customer demographics should be understood and prioritized in consideration of risk and return. Avoid one-sided profit-seeking types (takers), and give priority to those who desire a win-win relationship (matchers).</li>
<li>ideally, relationships with customers should be built that are strong but low-risk. Excessive dependence and exploitation are negative in the long run.</li>
<li>provide value within a reasonable range, taking into account the customer‚Äôs economic and emotional situation. Excessive exploitation may cause a backlash and negatively affect business.</li>
<li>Giver-type customers are an attractive target for profit without hassle, but they are not suitable for building long-term relationships. Building relationships with Matchers who want moderate quid pro quo is important for <a href="./sustainable-business" class="internal alias" data-slug="sustainable-business">sustainable business</a>.</li>
<li>a customer‚Äôs culture and human nature are expressed in the way he or she spends money and the relationships he or she has with others. This can be a factor in determining the attributes of the customer.</li>
</ol>
<p>In other words, the key to business success is to manage relationships with customers from a long-term perspective by accurately grasping their needs and striving to build win-win relationships. Unilateral exploitation may lead to short-term profits, but it is highly likely to hinder sustainable growth.</p>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/>Why are Giver-type customers not suitable for long-term relationship building?</p>
<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/claude/icon" alt="claude.icon" height="19.5"/>The main reasons why Giver-type clients are not suitable for long-term relationship building are</p>
<ol>
<li>unilateral relationship
<ul>
<li>Giver‚Äôs tendency to keep giving without asking for anything in return tends to create a one-sided relationship in business relationships. In the long run, this imbalance is not healthy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>dependence on the other party
<ul>
<li>Excessive reliance on Giver may result in the inability to properly value the company‚Äôs products and services. There is also a risk that the business will cease to exist when the Giver is no longer available.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>lost opportunity for growth
<ul>
<li>Giver relationships tend to make it difficult to obtain feedback to improve their products and services, and the opinions and needs of customers like Matcher, who demand appropriate quid pro quo, are an important source of information that can lead to business growth.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>long-term profitability
<ul>
<li>Failure to ask for fair compensation for Giver may result in a deterioration of profitability in the long run. To build a sustainable business, there must be an equivalent exchange of value with customers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>efficient use of resources
<ul>
<li>Overinvesting resources in Giver may affect the ability to provide services to other customers. In order to utilize limited resources efficiently, it is important to build relationships with matchers who are looking for moderate quid pro quo.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
