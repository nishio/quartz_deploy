<li>Somehow the project’s Next Action was blurry and confusing, so I consulted with him.</li>
<li>I was asked about the goal of the project and realized that it’s the multiple goals that are preventing me from choosing an action.</li>
<li>As I wrote out the goals and explained the value of each, I was able to narrow down the goals to prioritize: Achieve Goal 1 and use it to achieve Goal 3”.</li>
<li>I noticed that goal 3 is actually two steps.</li>
<li>Since the current implementation is free and open to the public, we were thinking of extending it, but realized that the new implementation should be closed.</li>

<li>Current Goals
<ul>
<li>Goal 1: Ensure that the Turbo version of Keichobot works with Keichobot’s WebUI, which is easy to use from a mobile phone.</li>
<li>Goal #2: A slightly improved UI for Keichobot that runs raw ChatGPT and eliminates the $20/month payment.</li>
<li>Goal 3: LlamaIndex to be able to pass reference information to GPT3 and incorporate it into the Turbo version of Keichobot.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Achieve Goal 1 and use it to achieve Goal 3.
<ul>
<li>Goal 2 is only to save money, so no rush.</li>
<li>I realized that Goal 3 is actually two steps: 1.
<ul>
<li>Be able to ask Keichobot for input</li>
<li>Keichobot will now generate opinions based on what I have written in the past.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Keichobot on GPT-3.5-Turbo will charge
<ul>
<li>Targeted and privately available first</li>
<li>Develop using something that works with API tokens and use it on your own first.</li>
<li>Invite interested parties to a closed beta.</li>

<ul>
<li>Wait for the development policy to be decided.</li>
<li>Summarize current goals
<ul>
<li>Goal 1: Ensure that the Turbo version of Keichobot works with Keichobot’s WebUI, which is easy to use from a mobile phone.</li>
<li>Goal #2: A slightly improved UI for Keichobot that runs raw ChatGPT and eliminates the $20/month payment.</li>

<p><img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/> What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/> Hopefully we can come to a decision on what to do about the next development.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/> Ask questions to help you have a more concrete vision of your next development.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/> as (a group, etc.)
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/> Please be specific about the goals you would like to achieve with your next development.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/> I see, you’re confused because you have multiple goals. I’ll write them all down. Goal 1: If the Turbo version of Keichobot runs on Keichobot’s WebUI, which is easy to use from a mobile phone, it will be easier to use than the current situation where it runs in a terminal. Goal 2: If Keichobot’s UI can be improved a bit to work with raw ChatGPT, I can stop my subscription to ChatGPT Plus. Goal 3: I have successfully used LlamaIndex to pass reference information to GPT3, and I would like to incorporate this into the Turbo version of Keichobot.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/> Your objectives have become specific goals. Next, consider what the value will be if those goals are achieved.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/> Goal 1: Ease of use! Goal 2: No more paying $20/month. Goal 3: Keichobot is great because it allows me to voice my opinion based on my past thoughts!
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/> Thank you. What would be the value to you if each of these goals were achieved?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/> When Goal 1 is overwhelmed, I can talk to the Turbo version of Keichobot while I walk or bathe, which boosts my thought process a lot. Goal 2 just saves a little money. Goal 3 is the possibility of unknown wonderful things happening.</p>
<ul>
<li>(PS: I noticed that I typoed “achievement” as “oppression,” but since it also serves as an experimental log, I’ll leave it as it is).
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/> Please tell us how the goals you have achieved relate to your personal goals.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/> Since I want to accelerate my own intellectual production with computer assistance, I thought I would do goal 1 first, then goal 3.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/> I see, you believe that Keichobot, which is easier to use, will help you organize your thoughts in order to accelerate your own intellectual production. Specifically, how will it accelerate it?
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/> The verbalization is encouraged by being asked questions and answering them, as you are doing now. When Goal 1 is achieved, you will be able to do this interaction not in front of the PC, but while taking a walk or bathing. When goal 3 is achieved, you can ask Keichobot for his/her opinion when you are stuck in your thinking, and you can say, “No, this is a little different. There are two stages: “You will be able to ask Keichobot for opinions,” and “Keichobot will generate opinions based on what you have written in the past. (notice)
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/> Understood. Then think about how you can accelerate your thinking as goal 1 is achieved.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/> Now that we know how it can be accelerated, we need to figure out how to implement it. There will be a charge, so we may lose money if it is freely available to everyone as it has been in the past.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/> Perhaps what is needed now is to know who is using Keichobot today and what they are looking for.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nishio/icon" alt="nishio.icon" height="19.5"/> That’s true. I see people using it from time to time, but it might be faster to target the heavy users “myself” first. I’ve been open to the public so far, so I just thought of it as an extension of that, a blind spot. I was thinking about creating a mechanism to charge users, or having users enter their API tokens, but I like the idea of starting with something that works with my API tokens, and aiming for private use by me. Then we can do a closed beta to anyone who is interested.
<img src="https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/nishio/nisbot/icon" alt="nisbot.icon" height="19.5"/> Understood.</li>
